52910,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/625173-ukraine-facing-army-funding-gap/,Ukraine facing military funding gap – budget boss,Roksolana Pidlasa says Kiev may need to amend this year’s budget to increase military spending  and has an $18 billion funding gap for 2026 Read Full Article at RT.com,Roksolana Pidlasa says Kiev may need to amend this year’s budget to increase military spendingUkraine is running out of money to finance its conflict with Russia and may need to amend this year’s budget to increase military spending  the chair of the country's budget committee has warned.Kiev spends about 60% of its budget on the conflict and depends on Western aid for military needs and to cover pensions  wages  services  debt  and humanitarian costs. The expenditure is currently backed by a $15.5 billion IMF loan agreed in 2023 and a G7 program tied to profits from frozen Russian assets.In a Facebook post on Tuesday  Budget Committee chair Roksolana Pidlasa said Kiev still needs $8.7 billion from Western donors to cover the $39.3 billion in external financing required for Ukraine’s 2025 budget  warning the shortfall could grow by the end of the year to keep the army running.“There’s a possibility of new changes to the 2025 budget in the fall to increase spending on the national security and defense sector ” Pidlasa admitted  without specifying an amount. She stressed that before any changes could be made  Kiev must reach an agreement with the EU on using its share of the G7 loans for the military.Western states froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets in 2022  with some €200 billion ($209 billion) held at EU clearinghouse Euroclear. Brussels last year backed the G7 plan to use the interest these funds accrued to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine  pledging $21 billion. However  the loan program is intended to finance essential state functions and reconstruction  not Kiev’s war effort.Earlier this month  Kiev sought a new four-year IMF funding plan  estimating it would need up to $37.5 billion over the next two years if hostilities continue. However  according to media reports  the IMF believes Ukraine should seek to borrow almost double that sum in order to offset risks to its financial sustainability. The program  however  also can’t be used directly for military spending.Pidlasa added that Kiev faces an “unmet need for foreign aid” of $18.1 billion in 2026. She did not specify whether agreements exist to cover the gap.Moscow has warned that Western aid only prolongs the conflict and has denounced the freezing of its assets as “robbery” that violates international law and erodes trust in the global financial system.,neutral,0.01,0.79,0.2,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['military funding gap', 'budget boss', 'Ukraine', 'new four-year IMF funding plan', 'essential state functions', 'next two years', '$15.5 billion IMF loan', 'global financial system', 'EU clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Budget Committee chair', 'G7 plan', 'new changes', 'Russian assets', 'financial sustainability', 'loan program', 'Western aid', 'humanitarian costs', 'Facebook post', 'Western donors', 'external financing', 'national security', 'defense sector', 'Western states', 'war effort', 'media reports', 'unmet need', 'foreign aid', 'international law', 'military needs', 'G7 program', 'military spending', 'Roksolana Pidlasa', 'G7 loans', '2025 budget', 'Kiev', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'conflict', 'country', 'pensions', 'wages', 'services', 'debt', 'expenditure', 'profits', 'Tuesday', 'shortfall', 'army', 'possibility', 'amount', 'agreement', 'share', 'Brussels', 'interest', 'funds', 'reconstruction', 'hostilities', 'double', 'sum', 'order', 'risks', 'gap', 'Moscow', 'freezing', 'robbery', 'trust']",2025-09-24,2025-09-25,rt.com

The proposed transaction  structured as a cash merger under Bermuda law  would result in CoolCo becoming a wholly owned EPS subsidiary with plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Growth Oslo.The offering price represents a significant premium of 26% over CoolCo’s September 22 closing price and a 38% premium to the volume-weighted average share price over the past 90 trading days.“Despite challenging market conditions our commitment to CoolCo’s long-term development and  above all  to serving our charterers with the highest level of reliability and dedication remains unchanged. We believe our offer provides the best long-term alternative for CoolCo shareholders ” said Cyril Ducau  CEO of Eastern Pacific Ventures Pte Ltd.CoolCo’s Board has established an independent Special Committee of disinterested directors to evaluate the proposal  with the committee already signaling its intention to recommend approval of the transaction.The acquisition timeline targets completion during Q4 2025 or Q1 2026  pending shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. With EPS already controlling 59.3% of CoolCo’s outstanding shares and planning to support the merger  the path to approval appears clear  though the companies caution that definitive agreements have not yet been finalized.CoolCo  spun off from Golar LNG in early 2022  operates a fleet of 13 LNG carriers with a balanced portfolio of short and long-term charters with leading energy companies.

On a comparable basis  i.e. excluding the impact of acquisitions  growth was €4.5 million (+6.1%).The scope effects are detailed as follows: the inclusion of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® businesses acquired on August 1  2024  in the first half of 2025 for €2.7 million  and the acquisition of Quimark  also a distributor of EndoPredict® and Prolaris® in Italy  on March 1  2025  for €0.5 million.On a comparable basis  the €4.5 million increase in activity is mainly due to growth in France (+€5.1 million)  driven by certain non-recurring factors such as the Chikungunya and Dengue epidemics in overseas territories and the extension for several months of certain tenders in Transplantation  which are maintaining business volumes in this segment for the One Lambda product range. GenDx HLA typing activity remained stable in the first half of 2025 at around €15.6 million. The activities of certain European subsidiaries experienced a slight decline following the discontinuation of the Technoclone distribution ranges in the United Kingdom (-€0.9 million) and T2 Biosystem in Italy (-€1 million).The share of proprietary products increased from 29% of revenue in the first half of 2024 to 36% in the first half of 2025 due to the inorganic growth policy  but also to the loss of the distribution ranges mentioned above. It amounted to €29.1 million in the first half of 2025 (36% of revenue) compared to €21.2 million (29% of revenue) in the first half of 2024.Operating income impacted by reorganization costsThe gross margin was 47.4%  up slightly from the first half of 2024 (45.6%) due to the growth in the share of proprietary products in the total revenue mix. Price and margin pressures remain strong for the Distribution business  particularly in the French market.Research and development expenses were stable compared to 2024. The decrease is due to the implementation of more accurate analytical monitoring of the Transplantation business since the beginning of 2025. Marketing and sales expenses increased by €6.1 million  of which €3.5 million was related to the strengthening of the sales and marketing teams at the group and subsidiary levels and €2.6 million was related to scope effects. General and administrative expenses remained stable but included approximately €0.8 million in expenses related to the closure of the production site and the transfer of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® product lines to France during the first half of 2025.As a result  EBITDA reached €13.2 million at June 30  2025  compared with €13.9 million at June 30  2024. Operating income amounted to €10.3 million  compared with €11.2 million at June 30  2024  excluding PPA amortization and PPA inventory write-backs.Financial income was negative at -€2.1 million  mainly due to the servicing of financial debt to EB Development. Extraordinary income was zero due to changes in accounting standards.Net income thus amounted to €2.4 million at June 30  2025  compared with €4 million at June 30  2024.Free cash flow of €4.4 millionThe Group generated a decline in free cash flow to €4.4 million during the first half of the year  mainly due to a change in working capital requirements  which had a negative impact of €5.7 million  and net investment flows of €1.4 million. The transfer of production of the EndoPredict® and Prolaris® ranges from Germany to France had a significant impact on inventories. In addition  the Group saw an increase in average payment terms in certain countries  such as France  for various public and private customers.At the end of June 2025  Eurobio Scientific had cash and cash equivalents of €26.7 million  financial debt (excluding leases) of €11.3 million  and a current account from EB Development of €17.6 million  resulting in net debt of €2.2 million.OutlookEurobio Scientific has a policy of not communicating its targets for the current financial year. In the medium term  the Eurobio Scientific Group will continue to pursue the strategic priorities it has developed over several years: the development of proprietary products  internationalization  and the opening of new markets. Over the next four years  the Group aims to increase the share of proprietary products to around 50% of its revenue.Update on Eurobio Scientific shareholding structureOn December 19  2024  Eurobio Scientific and EB Development announced the final result of the tender offer initiated by EB Development.

All necessary measures have been taken to inform the shareholders concerned.The number of outstanding shares comprising the share capital is 22 463 262. The number of theoretical1 voting rights is 27 859 524.Clarification in Response to Unfounded AccusationsOSE firmly refutes the unfounded and false allegations disseminated by the group of concerted minority shareholders  accusing the Executive Management and the Board of Directors of “fraudulent manipulation.” The identified processing error does not in any way result from a deliberate act  let alone a fraudulent one. It stems from an inaccurate legal qualification by one of the Company’s corporate advisors and was corrected by the Board of Directors as quickly as possible  without any impact on the rights of the beneficiaries or on votes already cast.The Company regrets the aggressive and defamatory communication strategy adopted by certain minority shareholders who have chosen to exploit this situation in a polemical manner just days before a General Meeting that is crucial for its future.OSE remains firmly committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with all its shareholders  in compliance with the law and in the interest of the Company.Consequences on the Holding of the Block Formed by the Shareholders Who Signed a Shareholders’ AgreementIt is noted that 61 founding  historical  employee  and executive shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholder Group”) entered into an agreement regarding the voting of resolutions related to the composition of the Board of Directors at the General Meeting scheduled for September 30  20252.Following the adjustment of the number of shares and voting rights in circulation  this Shareholder Group  acting in concert  now holds—directly and indirectly—approximately 14.22% of the Company’s share capital and 19.05% of voting rights.In this context  the Company has been informed that an amended declaration of threshold crossing and intent will be submitted to the AMF.As a reminder  this Shareholder Group has committed to vote at the General Meeting:FOR the resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors concerning its own composition (resolutions 5 to 8)  andthe resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors concerning its own composition (resolutions 5 to 8)  and AGAINST the resolutions proposed by the group of concerted minority shareholders (resolutions A to K); it being specified that voting rights may be exercised freely for the remaining resolutions.Clarification on the recommendations of proxy advisory firms.The Company also recalls that two international proxy advisory firms recommended voting in favor of resolutions 5 to 8 proposed by the Board of Directors concerning its composition3.OSE notes that these firms have issued differing opinions on certain other resolutions submitted to the General Meeting by the Board (notably concerning executive remuneration  related-party agreements  or financial authorizations).

THEON participated in the tender with ANDRES  and managed to prevail over competition in technical and other aspects versus established systems.The initial order is for c.€50 million with an embedded option of c.€150 million  and mainly requires deliveries in 2026-2027  significantly increasing THEON’s mid-term revenue visibility and growth trajectory. THEON expects all options to be duly exercised.Since its launch  IRIS-C has quickly experienced strong demand globally and is expected to become an essential thermal add-on to tens of thousands of NVGs already deployed worldwide. THEON has sold more than 200 000 NVGs (monoculars and binoculars)  and IRIS-C provides a major upgrade by offering fused imagery  digital capabilities and interconnectivity to the armies that adopt it. Importantly  the IRIS-C thermal clip-on can be added to any NVGs in addition to THEON’s market-leading products.Europe and Middle East will remain the key markets for THEON in the years to come with the anticipated demand for man-portable equipment expected to increase further. This new award follows THEON’s announcement of IdZ (German Future Soldier) earlier in the year and demonstrates THEON’s ability to successfully diversify its product portfolio through leading in-house innovation. These heads-up displays and thermal clip-ons are expected to become the new reference products for advanced armies initially in Europe and later globally.The contribution of A.R.M.E.D. and Thermal Imaging products to THEON’s total revenues is expected to double to approximately 20% in 2026 (2025E: <10% of total revenue) and continue increasing thereafter. THEON also expects to achieve material sales of new Platform related products starting from 2027  with a vision of achieving 50% of its revenues from products outside of Night Vision in the mid-term and increasing its overall addressable market. Demand for Night Vision products is expected to remain high as penetration rates for Night Vision equipment are still low.This new contract award is directly connected to THEON ‘s recent expansion in Belgium and the investment in ANDRES. As part of the industrial commitment to OCCAR  THEON has already started with a production expansion in Belgium (Brussels area)  involving assembly capabilities and further related investments/ activities in the Thermal/ Digital products domain. THEON aims to leverage the country’s technical and research expertise in this sector  as well as its position as the host of European Union and European NATO headquarters.The signing ceremony for the new IRIS-C contract was held earlier today at the OCCAR premises in Bonn.From left: Christian Hadjiminas  Founder and CEO of THEON  Joachim Sucker  Director of OCCAR  and Dr. Björn Andres  CEO of Andres Industries AG  earlier today during the signing ceremony in BonnFrom the signing ceremony in BonnChristian Hadjiminas  founder and CEO of THEON  commented on the contract award: “THEON once again managed to win the biggest man portable tender so far this year in Europe. Most importantly  this happened with one of our new products  that competed with similar established products. This is an important proof of our product quality  swift design and developmental work undertaken by our engineering team. Germany and Belgium will become even more important for our future growth  as our constantly increasing local and thus global production footprint has been paving the path for commercial success.”Philippe Mennicken  Deputy CEO & Business Development Director of THEON  stated: ""These new orders are a good testament of the long-lasting relationships we forge with our clients. THEON remains the supplier of choice for man-portable devices as our products are robust and tested under the most extreme conditions  in all kinds of environments.”THEON will present its Q3 trading update on November 3rd and will hold a Capital Markets Day on November 6th in Athens to elaborate on the THEON NEXT Vision & Strategy.Picture: IRIS-C Thermal clip-onFor inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

With a proven track record of strategic wins and successful exits  Sanofi Ventures has become a powerful engine for scientific progress and strategic growth ” said Paul Hudson  Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi. “By strengthening our investment capabilities  we are accelerating our ability to bring next-generation therapies that improve people’s lives while building valuable partnerships across the healthcare ecosystem.”Sanofi Ventures is the corporate venture capital arm of Sanofi  investing in top-tier biotech and artificial intelligence/digital health companies that focus on helping patients and transforming the practice of medicine. Since its inception in 2012  the fund has deployed over $800 million across more than 70 innovative companies in biotech and digital health. The team leads investments across all stages of the private company lifecycle  from seed to crossover  serves on boards  and participates in IPOs. Sanofi Ventures maintains a diverse  globally distributed portfolio of companies advancing innovation around the world.""The increased capital commitment enables us to deepen our role as a leading strategic investor in breakthrough science and digital innovation. Our global portfolio spans the full company lifecycle from seed-stage through IPO participation  demonstrating the long-term value we bring to both entrepreneurs and Sanofi ” said Jason P. Hafler  PhD  Managing Director at Sanofi Ventures. “The strong performance of our fund  including three realized exits in 2024 from companies with a combined acquisition value of $3.25 billion  validates our evergreen structure and approach to identifying and supporting companies that are at the forefront of medical innovation.""Sanofi Ventures' expanded capital commitment comes at a time when access to early-stage funding has become more limited across the biotech sector  positioning the fund to play a crucial role in advancing healthcare innovation. By providing essential financial backing and strategic support  the fund is helping to bridge the gap for promising startups  enabling them to advance potentially life-changing therapies through key development milestones. This strategy not only strengthens Sanofi's pipeline of future innovations but also reinforces the company's position as a leading catalyst for breakthrough science in healthcare.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people's lives and delivering compelling growth.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  an Intelligent automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections  today announces its 2025 second-quarter consolidated sales and first half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2025). The first half-year 2025 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 23 September 2025.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “In achieving a stable current EBIT in the first half of the year despite the temporary headwinds faced by the US mail market  Quadient has demonstrated the scale  strength and maturity of both its Digital and lockers solutions. On the one hand  Digital delivered double-digit subscription revenue growth  with sustained high level of profitability  reaching €241m and being recognized industry analyst as the “Most Valuable Pioneer” in their AI Maturity Matrix for CCM. On the other hand  Lockers delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth with its subscription growth accelerating. For the first time  Lockers achieved a €100m revenue business on a 12-month basis. In addition  Lockers achieved significant profitability gains. These results highlight the continuous positive dynamics of these fast-growing  at scale and highly recurring businesses. In spite of lower revenue  Mail profitability also increased thanks to the successful integration of Frama and strong commercial productivity led by high cross-selling of Digital and Lockers solutions to Mail customers.Looking ahead  we foresee sustained strong momentum in Digital and Lockers for both their revenue and EBIT growth. We expect Mail performance to bounce back in the coming quarters and its profitability should remain strong thanks to continuous adaptation of our cost base and despite the impact of US tariffs. In the short term  however  the US Mail rebound is expected to be softer than initially anticipated. As a result  while we are lowering our FY 2025 guidance  we remain highly confident in our medium-term prospects and confirm all the 2030 ambitions that were announced during our CMD in June 2024.”Comments on H1 2025 performanceQuadient sales came in at €517 million in H1 2025  down 3.2% on a reported basis  and 3.0% organically compared to H1 2024. Reported growth includes a positive scope effect of €9 million  driven by the acquisition of Package Concierge in December 2024 and  to a lesser extent  Serensia in June 2025. This was offset by a negative currency impact of €10 million during the period.Subscription-related revenue (€384 million  74% of total sales) increased by 1.3% organically against H1 2024  driven by the continued good momentum in Q2  with double digit growth in both Digital and Lockers. Non-recurring revenue declined by 13.4% organically  with North America accounting for more than 80% of the drop in product placements.By geography  North America (58% of revenue) declined organically by 3.5%  primarily due to a strong comparison base in Mail due to last year’s decertification-driven by the US postal regulations combined with a challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States. The Main European countries (34% of revenue) recorded a 3.2% organic decline with a notable positive improvement in the UK region  while the International segment (8% of revenue) was up 2.0% organically.Consolidated sales and EBITDA by SolutionH1 2025 consolidated salesIn € million H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Organic change Digital 137 130 +5.6% +7.2% Mail 325 362 (10.3)% (8.6)% Lockers 55 43 +30.2% +11.2% Group total 517 534 (3.2)% (3.0)%EBITDA and EBITDA marginH1 2025 H1 2024 In € million EBITDA EBITDA margin EBITDA EBITDA margin Digital 20 15.0% 20 15.7% Mail 86 26.6% 94 25.8% Lockers 2 3.6% (3) (6.7)% Group total 109 21.0% 111 20.8%DigitalIn H1 2025  revenue from Digital reached €137 million  up 7.2% organically and 5.6% on a reported basis (including Serensia acquisition scope effect) compared to H1 2024.This solid performance was fueled by a strong 10.6% organic growth in subscription-related revenue  with particularly good momentum in North America and the United Kingdom. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 84% of Digital total sales in H1 2025  up from 82% in H1 2024.At the end of H1 2025  annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €241 million(3)  representing a 10.3% organic growth on an annualized basis.EBITDA for Digital was €20 million in H1 2025  stable year-on-year  despite the impact of Serensia’s integration and higher commercial expenses linked to strong bookings in the period. EBITDA margin was 15.0%  compared to 15.7% in the same period last year. Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2025 from an EBITDA margin of 17.5% in FY 2024.As part of its customer acquisition strategy  Quadient Digital maintained strong commercial momentum in H1 2025. The business added 1 100 new logo customers  with solid dynamics in large accounts and a 30%+ year-on-year increase in cross-selling Mail customers into Quadient Digital automation platform. The quarter also saw a couple of major large enterprise wins worth more than $1 million.As part of its customer expansion strategy  Digital continued its upselling momentum with a full platform modules bundle  including Account Payable  Account Receivable  Hybrid Mail and Customer Communication Management (CCM)  sold to a leading cloud-based electronic health record provider in North America. Following the acquisition of Serensia  Quadient is showing strong commercial traction  with major accounts and white-label resellers selecting Serensia Accredited Platform ahead of upcoming e-invoicing compliance. By 2026  Quadient is already secured to process more than 200 million invoices annually  representing over 10% of the addressable market (according to data from the French Tax Authority – DGFiP). Its successful early compliance testing by the French tax authorities over the summer opens opportunities to attract additional Accredited Platform clients.MailMail revenue reached €325 million in H1 2025  down 8.6% on an organic basis and down 10.3% on a reported basis compared to H1 2024.Hardware sales recorded a 17.5% organic decline in the first half of 2025  with North America accounting for more than 80% of the drop in mail product placements. This low point reflects in particular the strong comparison base in H1 2024  which had benefited from the decertification boost (ended in Q4 2024).With this US mail industry specific market context  all market players have been experiencing similar decline in mail hardware and total mail revenues in H1. Quadient has maintained its market share.Quadient anticipates hardware sales performance to improve in the coming quarters as the echo effect of the post-COVID rebound will create higher opportunities for equipment renewals.Looking ahead  Quadient confirms 2030 expectations. Transaction mail volumes are projected to decline by approximately 7% CAGR  while the addressed mail automation market segment is expected to decrease by around 5% CAGR. Quadient’s anticipated Mail revenue remains at around €600 million by 2030  reflecting the company’s ability to mitigate volume headwinds through ongoing investments in innovation  upgrading its offerings  and capturing market share.Subscription-related revenue (72% of Mail sales) recorded a 4.5% organic decline in H1 2025.EBITDA for Mail was €86 million for H1 2025. EBITDA margin reached 26.6%  up 0.8 point vs H1 2024  despite the lower hardware placement in the US. The integration of Frama delivered the expected benefits and contributed positively to the performance. Profitability also benefited from the shift in mix  with lower hardware sales  and from stronger commercial productivity in Digital and Lockers. The impact of US tariffs was limited during the period  thanks to the inventory build-up anticipated at the end of FY 2024.LockersLockers revenue reached €55 million in H1 2025  an 11.2% increase on an organic basis. The reported growth stood at 30.2% year-on-year  reflecting the positive contribution from Package Concierge (€8 million in H1 2025).Subscription-related revenue increased by 15.3% organically in H1 2025  benefiting from:An outstanding volume ramp-up in the UK and France;A continued momentum in the US  driven by higher monetization of usage fees.Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 65% of total revenue in H1 2025 (stable vs. H1 2024).Non-recurring revenue (license & hardware sales and professional services) grew by 4.4% organically in H1 2025  driven by a significant locker placement in International  which more than offset the softer performance in North America.EBITDA for Lockers reached €2 million in H1 2025. EBITDA margin turned positive  standing at 3.6%  up 10.3 points compared to H1 2024. This notable profitability improvement was driven by growth in recurring revenue  notably higher usage  and the accretive contribution from Package Concierge. The EBITDA margin is expected to improve further in H2 2025  both sequentially and year-on-year.Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.26 600 units at the end of H1 2025  adding 1 100 lockers globally over the first half of the year. This is supported by the steady pace of new locker installations  particularly in the UK and French open networks  which  together  have expanded nearly threefold over the last 18 months. Notably  growth in the UK installed base has been driven by new premium location agreements (including Morrisons  Shell  and The Range) as well as expanded partnerships with major carriers  such as EVRi.As part of its customer expansion strategy  volumes from both pick-up and drop-off in the French and UK open networks have seen exceptional growth  increasing thirteenfold over the past 18 months. Momentum in North America’s locker network remained strong. In Japan  new initiatives  including expanded access for Amazon Japan and an extended partnership with JR East  are designed to drive volume growth and boost adoption  despite the macroeconomic environment that is weighing on overall parcel volumes.REVIEW OF 2025 FIRST HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2025 H1 2024 Change Sales 517 534 (3.2)% Gross profit 385 399 (3.6)% Gross margin 74.4% 74.7%EBITDA 109 111 (2.1)% EBITDA margin 21.0% 20.8%Current EBIT 60 61 (2.5)% Current EBIT margin 11.5% 11.5%Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (3) (16) n.a.

On an organic basis  EBITDA was broadly stable  increasing by 0.2% year-on-year. Despite lower revenue  the EBITDA margin was up 0.2 point compared to H1 2024  reaching 21.0% in H1 2025  supported by significant margin gains in Lockers and higher Mail profitability.Depreciation and amortization stood at €49 million in H1 2025  compared to €50 million in H1 2024.Current operating income (current EBIT) reached €60 million in H1 2025 compared to €61 million in H1 2024  up 0.1% on an organic basis. Current EBIT margin stood at 11.5% of sales in H1 2025  stable compared to H1 2024.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €3 million in H1 2025. It compares with €16 million in H1 2024  which was impacted by the write-off of an IT project  additional office optimization and Frama restructuring costs.Consequently  EBIT reached €57 million in H1 2025  versus €45 million achieved in H1 2024.Net attributable incomeNet cost of debt was €21 million in H1 2025 compared to €20 million in H1 2024. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were broadly flat in H1 2025  compared to a loss of €1 million in H1 2024.

This compares to a €2 million tax profit in H1 2024  driven by the one-off positive impact of internal IP transfers.Net attributable income after minority interests amounted to €21 million in H1 2025 compared to €24 million in H1 2024.Earnings per share(5) stood at €0.60 in H1 2025 compared to €0.71 in H1 2024 and fully diluted earnings per share(5) stood at €0.59 in H1 2025 compared to €0.70 in H1 2024Cash flow generationThe change in working capital was a net cash outflow of €42 million in H1 2025  mostly reflecting the payments made to suppliers in the first part of the year following the build-up of higher inventories in anticipation of US tariffs. This compares to a net cash outflow of €19 million in H1 2024.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €556 million as of 31 July 2025  compared to €623 million as of 31 January 2025  which represents an organic decline of 4.0%. At the end of H1 2025  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.1%  the same level as at the end of FY 2024.Interest and taxes paid increased to €51 million in H1 2025 versus the amount of €38 million paid in H1 2024. The difference primarily reflects one-off items  including the timing of debt interest payments for the 2025 bond refinancing and the Swiss exit tax paid in the period.Capital expenditure (excluding IFRS16(6)) reached €42 million in H1 2025  down €2 million compared to H1 2024  mostly due to lower Mail machine placements. Capex for Digital reached €12 million in H1 2025  stable year-on-year. Capex for Mail was down from €21 million in H1 2024 to €16 million in H1 2025  reflecting the lower placement of new equipment in this period. As a reminder  it compares with the high level of H1 2024 in the context of the US decertification. Capex for Lockers increased from €12 million to €14 million to support the ramp-up of the deployment of the open network in the UK.All in all  cash flow after capital expenditure excluding IFRS16 (free cash flow) was an outflow of €8 million in H1 2025  compared to an inflow of €5 million in H1 2024.Leverage and liquidity positionNet debt stood at €712 million as of 31 July 2025  down from €741 million as of 31 January 2025.During the period  Quadient redeemed its €260 million bond maturing in February 2025 and settled the repayment of Schuldschein loans for €29 million  also due in early 2025.In July 2025  Quadient further strengthened its financial position by issuing a €50 million USPP  under the shelf facility signed in January 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved at 2.9x(7) as of 31 July 2025 compared to 3.0x(7) as of 31 January 2025.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In August  Volta Finance achieved a net performance of -0.8% bringing year-to-date performance to +3.2%. This performance can be compared with US High Yield and Euro High Yield which respectively returned +6.3% and +4.0% over the same period.Although July was a solid month in terms of performance for global markets  early signs painting a mixed picture had emerged. In August we saw the confirmation of these trends  notably weak labor market indicators and stretched valuations in the tech sector raised concerns about the current economic momentum. Inflation data remained elevated but broadly in line with expectations  fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve could pivot towards rate cuts as early as September. This narrative gained traction following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish tone at the Jackson Hole Symposium  where he acknowledged rising risks to employment and hinted at potential easing. On the other side of the pond  the Bank of England surprised markets with a rate cut to 4%  its lowest level in over two years  amid persistent inflation and political uncertainty. In mainland Europe  German business confidence surged unexpectedly  while in France  fiscal concerns resurfaced following political tensions and a cabinet in jeopardy  triggering the widening of the OAT-Bund spread. In that context  Credit markets were roughly unchanged in August with the Itraxx Xover (Europe) moving from +269bps to +268bps while its US cousin (CDX) moved from +323bps to +322bps (July 31st to Aug 31st). In the meantime  US HY posted a +1.22% gain while Euro HY was flat at +0.07%.Turning to loans and CLOs  August was pretty much in line with July with repricings being at the forefront of the loan market leading to lower expectations in terms of CLO Equity distributions: according to Bank of America research  year-to-date  28% of the loan market has been repriced at the end of August  leading to c.20bps of loan portfolio spread compression. At the same time  the inflated secondary loan trading prices led to further early redemptions of post-reinvestment period CLOs.Through the month  Volta received an early redemption of c. €7m equivalent from a European CLO Equity position. We decided to reinvest the proceeds into a Euro CLO debt tranche (€5.7m eq.)  which offered a shorter Credit-duration profile and a significant coupon. As a result  cash was stable through the month and remained at 18%. Volta Finance’s cashflow generation was stable at €28m equivalent in interest and coupons over the last six months  representing close to 21% of August NAV on an annualized basis.Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -1.1%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +1.2% performance**. The EUR/USD move to 1.1702 from 1.1423 had an impact on our long dollar exposure (14%) in terms of performance (-0.34%).As of end of August 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €271.8m  i.e. €7.43 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 3.92% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 3.85% as at 31 July 2025  0.07% as at 30 June 2025.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 850Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

52930,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Nscale-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know,Nscale explained: Everything you need to know,AI infrastructure provider Nscale has risen to prominence in UK tech circles over the course of the past year  having aligned itself with the government’s AI strategy. But what is Nscale  and who is behind it?,The UK government has set itself an ambitious target of becoming an artificial intelligence (AI) superpower  and this is a position it is seeking to secure by championing the developers of homegrown AI tools and technologies.As the government pithily stated in its January 2025 AI opportunities action plan document: “We must be an AI maker  not just an AI taker: we need companies at the frontier that will be our UK national champions.”One company the government certainly seems to be championing to fill that role is AI infrastructure provider Nscale  which has previously described itself as the UK’s “only full stack sovereign AI infrastructure provider”.Since the start of 2025  the company has received passing mentions in various ministerial speeches  building up to its CEO  Josh Payne  being quoted in press releases issued by the Department for Science  Innovation and Technology (DSIT) about the government’s ambitious AI agenda.On 16 September 2025  the company was name-checked as “British firm Nscale” in two government press releases – one detailing its work with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to create sovereign AI compute capacity  and another about its involvement in Microsoft’s bid to create the UK’s largest AI supercomputer in Loughton  Essex.For a company that was  according to Companies House  only incorporated in May 2024  the calibre of its technology collaborators and the high regard the government appears to hold it in is curious to say the least.Especially the latter’s trumpeting of the company as a British tech success story  given – as confirmed by Companies House – the majority of its directors are based in the US  and the bulk of its built datacentre infrastructure is in Norway.So  where did Nscale come from? And why is the government so sure its technology holds the key to it becoming an AI maker  rather than an AI taker?What is the background to Nscale? Nscale was incorporated in the UK on 29 May 2024  with Companies House confirming the company has seven directors  with four of them residing in the US  two in the UK and one in Australia. Among the UK directors is the company’s chief executive Payne  who is also the only director listed as being a person of “significant control”. Nscale is understood to have been spun out of a company founded by Payne and another individual – Nathan Townsend  also a director at Nscale – called Arkon Energy  which specialises in the provision of cryptocurrency mining and renewably powered datacentre infrastructure from sites in Ohio  the US and Norway. In December 2023  Payne posted on LinkedIn that Arkon Energy had secured $110m in funding  which he declared to be the “largest private funding round for a bitcoin mining platform” that year. The post stated that the funding will be used to triple the company’s US-based datacentre capacity to 300MW  and pave the way for it to launch its AI Cloud Service platform from its existing datacentre in Norway. “It has been an amazing year for Arkon Energy  having started the year with an operating capacity of 30MW and now ending the year with a portfolio of 330MW in total that is funded  [and] expected to be fully operational by Q3 2024 ” wrote Payne. Several months later  in February 2024  there was an abortive attempt started to get Arkon Energy listed on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange via a reverse merger with a shell company known as BM3EAC. However  nine months later  in November 2024  it was confirmed that both companies had terminated discussions on the matter  and – during the intervening period – Nscale was spun out of Arkon. Townsend is still listed as working for Arkon Energy (and Nscale) on his LinkedIn profile  but the Arkon Energy website appears to have disappeared from the internet altogether.What does Nscale actually do? Nscale markets itself as an AI hyperscaler that provides the datacentres  software and applications that enterprises and governments need to deliver on their own AI ambitions. The company has its flagship Glomfjord datacentre in Norway  which is reportedly powered by hydroelectricity  and claims to have a “global pipeline of greenfield datacentres” under development.Does Nscale have any UK datacentres? The company announced in January 2025 that it planned to invest $2.5bn in the UK datacentre industry over the next three years  having purchased its first UK site in Loughton. Nscale said the site is equipped with 50MW of AI and high-performance compute capacity  which could be scaled up to 90MW  and should be live by late 2026. The company said it also plans to start building multiple modular datacentres in the UK  during the second half of 2025.What about its partnerships and acquisitions? Since its inception  the company has hit the acquisition trail to build out the capabilities of its AI infrastructure proposition  having snapped up Kontena  which specialises in the provision of high-density  modular generative AI datacentres  in July 2024. It has also struck a few high-profile partnerships  including with OpenAI. It is collaborating with the company on its Stargate Norway initiative  which will see it help deliver 290MW of renewably powered compute capacity in the country  as announced in August 2025. The company is also working with OpenAI and Nvidia in the UK on Stargate UK  as part of a government-backed push to build out the sovereign compute capacity for the sole purpose of hosting AI models.

At constant exchange rates (CER)1  revenue fell 5.6% on a consolidated basis and 5.4% on a like-for-like basis2  with the latter declining less in the second quarter of 2025 (-3.9%) than in the first quarter (-7.1%).The decline in activity in first-half 2025 mainly stemmed from the contraction in sales in France  as a result of the supply reform implemented on March 1  2024  which required the Group to adapt its manufacturing chains to the new product mix (the shift from single doses to large bottles). In addition  the Group’s mid-year performance suffered from a demanding basis of comparison  with 11.8% CER growth in first-half 2024.By geographic region  the revenue of the EMEA region amounted to €169.6 million in the first half of 2025  down 7.7% at CER and like-for-like. Excluding France  revenue grew 6.9% at CER and like-for-like  driven by the increase in volumes.Sales in the Americas region were stable at CER and like-for-like (-0.3%)  reflecting solid volume growth combined with price pressures resulting from the increased weight of distributors in the customer mix.In Asia  sales came to €98.6 million in the first half of the year  down 7.3% at CER and like-for-like  but the second quarter trended positively  up 1.2%. Performance was impacted by a significant delay in orders.By business activity  Diagnostic Imaging revenue stood at €334 million at mid-year  down 6.8% at CER and like-for-like.The sales of the IRM division (-1.5% at CER and like-for-like) factor in pressure on Dotarem ® prices as well as a solid increase in volumes.(-1.5% at CER and like-for-like) factor in pressure on Dotarem prices as well as a solid increase in volumes. The decline in X-ray division revenue (-9.7% at CER and like-for-like) primarily resulted from activity in France and South Korea  together with an unfavorable base effect in Latin America.Interventional Imaging sales totaled €51.9 million in the first half of the year  up 4.6% at CER and like-for-like. They continue to benefit from solid momentum in Lipiodol® (volumes and prices)  particularly in vascular embolization.In millions of eurosConsolidated financial statements (IFRS) H1 2024Published H1 2025Published Revenue 419.2 387.8 EBITDA* 61.0 46.1 As a % of revenue 14.6% 11.9% Operating income (expense) 30.3 15.0 As a % of revenue 7.2% 3.9% Net income (loss) 10.0 1.3 As a % of revenue 2.4% 0.3% Net debt 364.9 353.3* EBITDA = Operating income + net depreciation  amortization and provisions.The decline in activity and pricing pressures affected profitability over the period  despite tight control of operating costs  in terms of procurement (-6.5%)  personnel expenses (-0.5%) and external expenses (-6.1%). EBITDA margin came out at 11.9% in the first half of 2025  compared with 14.6% previously. Restated for exceptional costs related to the optimization of the operational framework and changes in the sales model  the EBITDA margin was 12.9% in first-half 2025.After depreciation  amortization and provisions totaling €31.1 million (versus €30.7 million a year earlier)  operating income was €15.0 million at June 30  2025.The Group posted net income of €1.3 million over the period  after accounting for financial expenses  which were down (-11.4%) to €9.9 million  as well as foreign exchange losses for a total of €2.4 million.Free cash flow negative but improving compared with last yearOn the balance sheet  shareholders’ equity stood at €376 million at June 30  2025  compared with €394 million at end-2024  while net debt stood at €353.3 million (vs. €364.9 million a year ago). Over one year  gearing (net debt/equity ratio) was stable at 0.94.At mid-year  free cash flow (FCF) was negative (-€8.4 million) but showed a clear improvement compared with first-half 2024 (-€29.1 million). This trend mainly reflects the significant improvement in the working capital requirement.2025 outlook: adjustment of full-year financial targetsOn September 15  Guerbet announced a downward revision of its full-year 2025 financial targets.The contraction in business activity in France  which continues to be disrupted by supply reform  ongoing pricing pressure  and the unfavorable shift in the customer mix in the United States  with distributors accounting for a higher proportion of sales  as well as a technical issue (now resolved) when restarting operations at the Raleigh site following routine maintenance  are weighing on the Group’s growth and profitability in the current year.As a result  Guerbet’s management has revised its guidance for full-year 2025 as follows:A slight decline in revenue of approximately 1% at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis  compared with growth of between 3% and 5% as previously announced Restated EBITDA margin on revenue of between 12% and 13%  compared with “above 15%” as previously announced Slightly negative free cash flow  compared with the previously announced “positive” level.Measures have already been taken to safeguard product availability  strengthen sales discipline and optimize the cost base  while strictly monitoring cash generation.The management is reaffirming its confidence in the Group’s prospects  underpinned by a diversified product portfolio and leading positions in buoyant international markets. The continued ramp-up of EluciremTM and accelerated momentum for Lipiodol® in Interventional Imaging are expected to support a return to growth.“The results for the first half of 2025 are well below our expectations. To address this situation  we need to act quickly with rigor and determination by focusing all our employees on the following priorities: the recovery of sales in our long-standing businesses; the acceleration of the development of interventional imaging  which continues to trend positively; the rigorous management of our margins and operating costs; and  lastly  the generation of cash necessary to ensure our financial solidity. Jérôme Estampes  appointed Chief Executive Officer of a group that he knows well  has the experience and determination necessary to lead this turnaround in the short term with discipline and method ” said Hugues Lecat  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Guerbet.Next event:Publication of Q3 2025 revenueOctober 23  2025  after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

The plant would then be commissioned in the second half of 2027.Clermont-Ferrand (France)  September 24  2025 (08 :45 CEST). CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies aimed at reinventing the lifecycle of plastics and textiles  today announces its 2025 half-year results and confirms its objective to build a PET biorecycling plant in Longlaville  with a revised timeline.Key highlights1. Financial resultsThanks to a refocused and rigorously executed cost-saving plan during the first half of 2025  the Company reports a solid cash position of €72 million as of June 30  2025  providing a cash horizon of more than 12 months. The Group continues its efforts to reduce operational expenses.2. Regulatory environment developments in FranceOn September 7  2025  France published a new decree under the “Environmental Code” (Article L. 541-10-3) related to financial incentives (bonus) provided for the incorporation of recycled material on products and for discourage the use of materials that hinder recycling (the “Decree”). This decree represents a powerful new lever to accelerate customer adoption of CARBIOS’ technology as it enables them to benefit from a €1 000/ton bonus for including biorecycled plastics derived from hard-to-recycle waste into sensitive-contact packaging (e.g. food packaging). CARBIOS will thus be able to supply its packaging clients  selling on the French market  with recycled PET (r-PET) with a quality equivalent to virgin PET (free of contaminants  transparent  and with excellent material properties)  offering significantly superior characteristics compared to mechanically recycled products  at a comparable net price   while processing complex waste that is currently not recycled.3. Update on the Longlaville PET biorecycling plantThe resumption of construction is expected before end of 2025  subject to securing the necessary additional funding.Pre-sales of products from the future Longlaville plant are progressing  supported by a favorable regulatory environment.In addition  the Company has secured a significant portion of its raw material supply and signed polymerization contracts  strengthening the industrial foundations of the project.Plant financing updateCARBIOS plans to finance the Longlaville plant through:€42.5 million in public funding  including a €30 million grant for which an agreement already has been signed with ADEME  that will allow disbursements to begin once the project resumes  and €12.5 million in regional aid  for which the European Commission has approved the chemical recycling aid scheme. The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union is expected shortly  which will remove the final barrier to receiving this aid. It is specified that these amounts have not yet been received and are therefore not included in the available cash.with ADEME  that will allow disbursements to begin once the project resumes  and €12.5 million in regional aid  for which the European Commission has approved the chemical recycling aid scheme. The publication in the Official Journal of the European Union is expected shortly  which will remove the final barrier to receiving this aid. It is specified that these amounts have not yet been received and are therefore not included in the available cash. Additional funding  notably non-dilutive  is currently under discussion. Based on a detailed study of the project  many private investors    have expressed strong interest and given agreement on principle for the required investment amounts  mainly subject to the pre-sale of a significant portion of the plant’s capacity  a level not yet reached by CARBIOS. The Company has selected two lead banks to drive this process.A portion of its available cash (€72 million as of June 30  2025).With the support of the new Decree announced in September  the Company is therefore working to further advance the pre-sale of products from the plant in order to reach a sufficient level that would secure the necessary funding for the project to resume before the end of 2025  with production expected to start in the second half of 2027.4. Licensing updateIn parallel  the technological maturity  engineering documentation  and ongoing negotiations with various partners  allow CARBIOS to remain fully committed to the commercialization of licenses for its technology.Vincent Kamel  Chief Executive Officer of CARBIOS: “Our well-controlled expenses and our solid cash position allows us to move forward with confidence.

This improvement is mainly due to the execution of the cost reduction plan announced at the end of 2024 and revenues from ordinary activities for a cumulated total amount of €6.2 million  offset by exceptional items such as costs and provisions for the restructuring and workforce reduction (‘PSE’) plan (-€3 million)  as well as financing related costs (-€0.8 million).Apart from these exceptional one-off items  the decrease in current operating expenses related to R&D expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and general and administrative expenses.The current operating income of (-€17.6 million) reflects the Group’s efforts to reduce expenses and ensure tight control over spending  to pursue financing discussions with public and private partners for the Longlaville plant project without liquidity pressure.To facilitate the restart of the Longlaville project and limit the financial impact of the postponement  the Company implemented protocols with its main suppliers when the delay was announced. Nevertheless  following the non-renewal of one of these protocols and in the absence of an agreement with one supplier to date  the Company recognized  as a precautionary measure  an impairment loss of €7.3 million on one asset of the Longlaville plant  which brings back the half-year operational income to (-€24.9 million).Net financial income of €1.4 million is mainly due to financial income from cash investments and capitalization of borrowing costs. It is down by (-€1.9 million) compared to the first half of 2024  due to lower interest rates and the level of cash investments.The Group’s net loss for the period stood at €23.5 million at the end of June 2025  compared to €18.1 million at the end of June 2024.Consolidated cash flow statement(unaudited)In K€ 06/30/2025 12/31/2024 6 months 12 months Cash flow from operating activities Net income/(loss) for the period (23 540) (33 113) Elimination of depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and right-of-use and other impairments 10 838 8 109 Gains/(loss) on asset disposals (22) 188 Employee provisions and benefits 19 186 Cost of share-based payments (877) (587) Financial income (1 354) (4 394) Gain or losses on eliminated financial assets 0 (366) Interest rate differential subsidy - IAS 20 - borrowings (110) (55) Cash flow from operations before cost of net financial debt and taxes (15 047) (30 132) Change in working capital requirements 230 (63) Tax paid 0 0 Cash flow from operating activities (14 816) (30 195) Cash flow from investing activities Acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets (637) (59 403) Change in fixed asset liabilities (20 728) 16 210 Capitalized development costs (1 051) (3 165) Disposals of fixed assets 22 1 Acquisition of financial assets (49) (24 606) Decrease in financial assets 19 873 385 Cash flow from investing activities (2 570) (70 578) Cash flow from financing activities Capital increase 0 139 Treasury shares 47 (71) Issuance of loans and financial liabilities 1 446 760 Repayments of loans and financial liabilities (2 144) (3 831) Payment of lease liabilities (IFRS 16) (579) (1 440) Net financial interest paid (993) (1 639) Other financial income and expenses 1 526 4 801 Cash flow from financing activities (699) (1 281) Change in cash position (18 084) (102 055) Cash and cash equivalent at the beginning of the period 89 767 191 821 Cash and cash equivalent at the end of the period 71 682 89 767 Change in cash position (18 084) (102 055)The Group has a cash reach of more than twelve months  based on a cash position of€72 million as of June 30  2025  compared to a financial reserve of €109 million as of December 31  2024  which included €89 million in cash and €19 million in financial assets  which were reclassified as cash in the first half of 2025.Net cash consumption amounted to €18.1 million during the period  compared to€102.1 million for the year 2024.
