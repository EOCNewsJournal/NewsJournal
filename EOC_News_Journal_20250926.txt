Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/ AFP via Getty ImagesGerman chancellor Friedrich Merz has called on the EU to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine’s war effort  arguing the move could unlock a €140 billion loan for Kyiv and show “staying power” against Russian aggression.In a stark reversal of Berlin’s previous scepticism about tapping seized Russian assets  Mr Merz said the loan should be used to fund military equipment  with EU governments deciding on procurement alongside Kyiv.The appeal from the leader of Europe’s largest economy and Ukraine’s biggest backer comes as the European Commission examines options to leverage the €194 billion worth of Russian assets held at Euroclear  Belgium’s central security depository.Writing in the Financial Times  Mr Merz insisted the bloc must find a legal mechanism to use the assets  saying it was imperative to “systematically and massively raise the costs of Russia’s aggression”.EU governments  including Germany  have long resisted confiscating the assets  citing financial and legal risks and expressing concern that such a move could undermine confidence in the euro as a reserve currency and spark military escalation from Russia.But with Donald Trump reducing US support for Kyiv and refusing to sign off on fresh sanctions against Moscow  pressure is mounting to use the frozen assets.Mr Merz said that the EU could make available an interest-free loan of almost €140 billion “without intervening in property rights”  adding: “That loan would only be repaid once Russia has compensated Ukraine for the damage it has caused during this war.”“Now I am advocating the mobilisation of financial resources on a scale that will secure Ukraine’s military resilience for several years ” he wrote.[ Zelenskiy tells UN that Russia is seeking to expand fighting beyond UkraineOpens in new window ]Mr Merz stressed that the funds should be directed exclusively for the purchase of military equipment  not to cover Ukraine’s general budget.“Such a comprehensive programme must also help to strengthen and expand the European defence industry ” he wrote. “That would serve both our collective security and European sovereignty.”Under Mr Merz’s proposal  the loan would first be guaranteed by member states before being collateralised using money from the EU’s next long-term budget in 2028.The mechanism should  he argued  be agreed by a “large majority” of member states  suggesting he favoured a structure that could not be vetoed by opponents of the move  such as Hungary.“Now is the moment to apply an effective lever that will disrupt the Russian president’s cynical game of buying time and bring him to the negotiating table ” Mr Merz said. -Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025,neutral,0.08,0.85,0.07,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Merz', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'The Financial Times Limited', 'central security depository', 'next long-term budget', 'European defence industry', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Mr Merz', 'general budget', 'collective security', 'European Commission', 'European sovereignty', 'frozen assets', 'financial resources', 'Russian president', 'Getty Images', 'staying power', 'stark reversal', 'previous scepticism', 'military equipment', 'largest economy', 'biggest backer', '€194 billion worth', 'legal risks', 'reserve currency', 'military escalation', 'Donald Trump', 'US support', 'fresh sanctions', 'property rights', 'military resilience', 'several years', 'new window', 'comprehensive programme', 'member states', 'large majority', 'effective lever', 'cynical game', 'negotiating table', 'Russian aggression', 'war effort', 'legal mechanism', '€140 billion loan', 'EU governments', 'interest-free loan', 'costs', 'Photograph', 'AFP', 'Ukraine', 'move', 'Kyiv', 'Berlin', 'procurement', 'appeal', 'leader', 'options', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'bloc', 'Germany', 'concern', 'confidence', 'Moscow', 'pressure', 'damage', 'mobilisation', 'scale', 'Zelenskiy', 'UN', 'fighting', 'purchase', 'proposal', 'money', 'structure', 'opponents', 'moment', 'Copyright']",2025-09-25,2025-09-26,irishtimes.com

The company has signed the acquisition of University Compounding Pharmacy (UCP)  a 503A pharmaceutical compounder specializing in the health and wellness segment in California  whilst adhering to a disciplined acquisition strategy.The company has also been inspected by the FDA at its Wichita and Las Vegas facilities  with none of the observations from the 2024 inspection in Wichita being now repeated  which validates our remediation has addressed the Agency’s prior concerns.UCPUCP  based in San Diego  the U.S.  is a 503A pharmaceutical compounder specializing in the health and wellness segment  with strong positions in hormones and urology and a solid compliance record  making it highly complementary to Anazao and enabling a differential coast-to-coast offering. This underpins Fagron’s strategy to build a nationwide compounding platform in the U.S.  spanning both 503A (patient-specific) and 503B (outsourcing) services.The acquisition deepens Fagron’s presence in North America’s prevention and lifestyle segment and strengthens our position in California  one of the largest and most tightly regulated healthcare markets in the U.S.  where licences are difficult to obtain.The enterprise value of this acquisition is c.$41.5 million. It will be fully financed through Fagron’s own resources and remains subject to customary clearance. This business generates around twenty five million dollars in annual revenue and an EBITDA margin below Fagron’s existing group margin. We expect to realise synergies over the next 18–24 months as the business is integrated into Fagron’s operations.Quality UpdateThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted an inspection at Fagron Sterile Services (“FSS”) in Wichita  Kansas to verify the corrective and preventive actions taken following the routine inspection in June 2024 and the Warning Letter issued in December 2024. In March 2025  the Agency acknowledged our CAPA submission and stated it adequately addressed their concerns  pending an on-site verification. During the 2025 visit none of the observations from the 2024 inspection were repeated  which validates our remediation has addressed the Agency’s prior concerns.Separately  following this new routine inspection  the FDA issued a Form 483 with six observations. In addition  the FDA also conducted a routine inspection of the 503B Anazao Health facility in Las Vegas with four observations.Fagron remains committed to working collaboratively with the FDA to address its inspectional observations and is already implementing new corrective actions to further improve its protocols. Our top priority is providing safe and effective sterile drug products to our customers and their patients and we remain confident in our robust systems and the quality and safety of the products we produce.Financial calendar 20259 October 2025 Trading update third quarter 2025Results and trading updates are published at 7.00 AM CET.Further informationIgnacio ArtolaGlobal Investor Relations LeaderTel. +34 670385795ignacio.artola@fagron.comAbout FagronFagron is the leading global company active in pharmaceutical compounding  focusing on delivering personalized medicine to hospitals  pharmacies  clinics  and patients in more than 35 countries around the world.The Belgian company Fagron NV is based on Venecoweg 20A in Nazareth and is listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Amsterdam under the ticker symbol ‘FAGR’.

The approach is the same for the consolidated financial statements  with certain specific items for the fiscal year still recorded in the relevant lines under recurring operating income. Until 2024  these specific items were reported under other non-recurring operating income and expenses. As a result  2025 “adjusted” indicators are comparable to the 2024 “recurring” indicators  allowing the Group to continue presenting its financial information using the same format.Consolidated revenues rose €3.5 million  or 1.1%  to €322.5 million in H1 2025 compared with €319.0 million in H1 2024. The negative scope effect of €5.6 million  or 1.8%  was attributable to the deconsolidation of INPS in the UK on December 10  2024  which was only partly offset by the consolidation of Visiodent over six months vs. four months in 2024. The positive currency impact was €0.2 million  or 0.1%  chiefly owing to appreciation of the pound sterling against the euro. Like-for-like(2) revenues grew 2.8% over the period  in line with the Group’s public projections.Adjusted EBITDA(4) rose €9.0 million between the first half of 2024 and 2025  or 17.2%. The improvement was attributable to good cost management—particularly for external costs  with less use of contract workers in favor of bringing skills in-house while still keeping payroll costs under control. The deconsolidation of INPS also contributed to the improvement.Depreciation and amortization expenses rose slightly  by €0.8 million or 2.1%  chiefly due to an increase in R&D amortization  which was €23.8 million at June 30  2025  compared with €22.7 million a year earlier  or a €1.1 million increase.Adjusted operating income(1) climbed €8.2 million to €18.5 million in H1 2025 (5.7% of revenue) compared with €10.3 million in H1 2024 (3.2%). The increase came despite a €4.2 million headwind from R&D—the Group capitalized €3.1 million less in the first half and amortized €1.1 million more than in the first half of 2024. This improvement was spurred by good performances in pharmacy advertising  human resources  insurance and data  as well as the deconsolidation of INPS.Other non-current operating costs(5) amounted to €7.4 million in H1 2025  and there were another €1.6 million of specific items(1) that affected operating income  for a total of €9.0 million on a comparable basis  compared with €2.6 million in the same period in 2024. The biggest items were a €6.0 million provision and €1.4 million in related costs for workforce restructuring at the pharmacy business in France  as well as various other reorganizational costs.Taking these elements into account  operating income came to €9.5 million at June 30  2025  compared with €7.7 million a year earlier  a 22.4% increase.Financial expense came to €8.3 million  compared with a €5.0 million expense in H1 2024  as the Group refinanced its debt at higher interest rates on July 31  2024.Tax amounted to €1.0 million in the first half of 2024 compared with €2.9 million a year earlier.Analysis of business trends by divisionin millions of euros Total Software & Services Flow Data & Marketing BPO Cloud & Support Revenue 2024 319.0 152.1 49.5 59.3 39.9 18.1 2025 322.5 144.4 53.4 63.4 43.2 18.2 Change +1.1% (5.1)% +7.8% +6.9% +8.1% +0.3% Adjusted operating income(1) 2024 10.3 (1.4) 5.9 5.3 1.9 (1.3) 2025 18.4 +1.9 5.7 9.2 1.5 +0.1 Change +78.4% +233.6% (2.9)% +75.6% (21.2)% +105.3%Adjusted operating margin(1) (as a % of revenue) 2024 3.2% (1.0)% 11.8% 8.9% 4.8% (7.0)% 2025 5.7% 1.3% 10.7% 14.6% 3.5% 0.4%Software & Services: H1 2025 revenue posted a €7.7 million decrease  but adjusted operating income(6) improved by €3.3 million and moved into positive territory  ending the first half of 2025 at a profit of €1.9 million compared with a €1.4 million loss a year earlier.Software & Services First half Change2025 / 2024in millions of euros 2025 2024 Revenue 144.4 152.1 (7.7) (5.1)% Cegedim Santé 38.4 38.9 (0.5) (1.3)% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies and other services 87.5 86.7 +0.8 +0.9% International businesses 18.5 26.5 (8.0) (30.3)% Adjusted operating income(1) 1.9 (1.4) 3.3 +233.6% Cegedim Santé (3.2) (1.6) (1.6) (100.1)% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies and other services 6.7 3.4 3.3 +97.0% International businesses (1.6) (3.2) 1.6 +51.4%Sales at Cegedim Santé slowed  mainly because a data service agreement came to an end in late 2024 and was renewed in the second quarter of 2025 at a lower rate. Even so  EBITDA was virtually flat over the period thanks to good cost management—particularly for personnel costs—and despite a €1 million drop in R&D capitalization. On the other hand  adjusted operating income (1) was €1.6 million lower owing to an increase in R&D amortization charges over the first half. The Group has begun amortizing its projects more quickly than in the past and during H1 2025 aligned Visiodent’s amortization schedule with that of the Group. Thus  Cegedim Santé’s recovery is on track and is expected to post slightly positive cash flow at the end of the year.Adjusted operating income(1) from the division’s other activities in France rose €3.3 million on the back of good performances by HR solutions  which kept costs under control during a period of strong growth  and by health and provident insurance  which got a boost from starting up projects won in 2024. Dynamic performances from these activities offset a modest slowing in pharmacy activities  whose adjusted operating income slipped by €0.3 million over the first half.Adjusted operating income(1) from international activities improved by €1.7 million  chiefly due to the deconsolidation of UK subsidiary INPS on December 10  2024. That more than made up for a cyclical slowdown in UK insurance activities—caused by the end of a contract—and in pharmacy activities—caused by the need to streamline certain cost items that can no longer be shared with INPS.Flow : Revenue increased 7.8%  with positive contributions from both activities. Cegedim e-business (digitalization of processes and data flows) posted growth of 7.1% in its two market segments: Invoicing & Procurement (France and UK) and Healthcare Flow (notably in pharmaceutical supply chain security for hospitals). The Third-party payer business experienced 8.8% growth in the first half. It was boosted by strong growth in demand for its fraud and long-term illness detection offerings.

Adjusted operating income contracted by €0.4 million  notably because one of its clients was transferred from the HR BPO business to HR Software business. Cloud & Support: Adjusted operating income(7) for the first half of 2025 inched back into positive territory—at €0.1 million vs. a €1.3 million loss in 2024—due to ongoing work to realign the cost structure  particularly with respect to payroll costs.HighlightsSBTi validates Cegedim’s decarbonization targetsThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) officially validated Cegedim Group’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on June 12  2025. SBTi is the global standard for measuring companies’ carbon footprints and certifying their stated action plans for reducing emissions in line with the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Cegedim is now part of the select group of about 8 000 companies whose plans have been validated. This major step shows the strong commitment of Cegedim's senior management  and all its subsidiaries  to the sustainable development of the Group's activities.Credit facility converted to a sustainability-linked loanOn June 16  2025  the Group negotiated an addendum with all of the parties to its loan agreement to add performance clauses related to 2030 ESG commitments  making this a sustainability-linked loan. By adhering to the annual Scopes 1 & 2 and Scope 3 decarbonization trajectory validated by SBTi  and by making progress on gender equality in senior management  the Group will be able to lower its interest rate by up to 0.05 percentage points for the bank portion and by 0.10 to 0.40 percentage points for the non-bank portion. Conversely  failure to respect those commitments will increase interest rates by a commensurate amount. The first milestone for applying this arrangement will be the 2025 ESG performance as reported in 2026.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2025Workforce restructuring at the pharmacy businessThe Group has decided to restructure the workforce at its pharmacy management software business in France  which will make around 100 positions redundant. By rethinking its organization and reconfiguring to align with market trends and client needs  the Company hopes to return to a level of performance that ensures a solid foundation for employees and innovation for clients.After the first-half close  the Group received approval from France’s regional labor and economics agency  DRIEETS  for the collective agreement it negotiated in the second quarter of 2025 with employee representatives. As a result  Cegedim has earmarked a provision for the estimated impact in its H1 2025 financial statements (see other non-recurring income and expenses below).Cegedim Group shares transferred to trading on Euronext GrowthTrading in shares of Cegedim SA were transferred from the regulated market of Euronext Paris (compartment B) to Euronext Growth Paris on September 4  2025. The Euronext admission committee approved the application to admit the shares to Euronext Growth Paris on August 29  2025. We discussed the rationale for the move and its impacts in a press release dated June 13  2025.Business activities of INPS soldThe business activities of INPS have been sold to OneAdvanced  a UK-based IT services provider  pursuant to a decision by the court-appointed administrator who has overseen the business since December 10  2024. With this initial step now complete  the process of liquidating the subsidiary may begin. These events will not impact the Group’s financial statements until INPS is definitively liquidated  which is likely to happen during the first half of 2026  at which point Cegedim may receive a liquidation dividend.OutlookBased on the currently available information  the Group expects 2025 like-for-like revenue growth(8) to be in the range of 2-4% relative to 2024. Adjusted operating income(9) should continue to improve substantially.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic or currency risks.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 24  2025. The Board of Directors  chaired by Jean-Claude Labrune  met on September 25  2025  and approved the consolidated financial statements at June 30  2025. As a result of the move to Euronext Growth  half-yearly financial statements are no longer audited.

Half-year revenues and earnings  particularly marked...,2025 first-half earnings: RIBER confirms the rollout of its roadmap and its annual outlook.Half-year revenues and earnings  particularly marked by seasonal activity patterns.Order book of €27.7m at June 30  2025  strengthened since the summer by around €14m in additional orders.First two sales of ROSIE  a key milestone in the silicon photonics roadmap2025 target confirmed: revenues > €40mBezons  September 25  2025 - 8:00am - RIBER  a global market leader for semiconductor industry equipment  is releasing its earnings for the first half of 2025.(€m) H1 2025(6 months) H1 2024(6 months) 2024(12 months) RevenuesSystems revenues10.77.813.79.441.2 31.0 Services and accessories revenues 3.0 4.3 10.2 Gross margin% of revenues 3.936.2 % 4.834.8 % 14.836.1% Operating income% of revenues (0.7)(6.1 %) (0.0)(0.2 %) 4.410.6 % Net income% of revenues (0.8)(7.6 %) 0.21.2 % 4.110.0 %Key developments for the first half of the yearIn a complex international environment  RIBER recorded solid commercial activity despite particularly pronounced seasonality. The Company continues to strengthen the appeal of its technological offering with the rollout of its silicon photonics roadmap and the signing of the first two ROSIE sales  a key step towards the industrialization of this innovative equipment. This momentum is reflected in the sustained level of order intake  with a total of nine systems ordered over the first nine months of the year  both for research and for industrial production  particularly in the fields of datacom and quantum technologies. However  services and accessories activities are affected by economic uncertainties weighing particularly on the research sector.RevenuesRevenues for the first half of 2025 came to €10.7m  reflecting a delivery schedule concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year. Systems revenues came to €7.8m with three machines delivered  including two for production  compared with three production machines over the same period in 2024. Services and accessories revenues came to €3.0 m.EarningsGiven the traditional seasonality of sales  first-half results cannot be extrapolated to the full year. This trend is reinforced in 2025  with around one quarter of revenues generated in the first half  which nevertheless bears nearly half of fixed costs.The gross margin for the period came to €3.9m  representing 36.2% of revenues  compared with 34.8% in the first half of 2024.Operating expenses were down -6%. In this context  operating income came to €(0.7)m  compared with break-even in the first half of 2024.Net income came to €(0.8)m  compared with a profit of €0.2m in the first half of 2024. It includes net financial expenses of €0.1m.Cash flow and balance sheetAt the end of June 2025  the cash position amounted to €2.5m  compared with €8.6mn at December 31  2024. This reflects the impact of delivery seasonality on working capital requirements  the distribution to shareholders from the issue premium paid out in June  and sustained levels of investment.Shareholders’ equity at end-June 2025 came to €21.3m  compared with €23.6m at the end of 2024  primarily taking into account the half-year earnings and the distribution to shareholders from the issue premium.Order book at June 30  2025At June 30  2025  the order book stood at €27.7m  down -23% compared with June 30  2024. System orders came to €22.5m (-25%)  based on nine machines  including six for production. This change is due to the denial of two export licenses (representing €4m in lost orders) and longer approval timelines for licenses. Orders for services and accessories totaled €5.2m  down -11%.This order book does not include the orders announced in August and September 2025 (two MBE 6000 production systems  one ROSIE machine  and one Compact 21 research system)  representing a cumulative amount of around €14m.OutlookIn a context marked by the rollout of major investment programs in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies  RIBER expects new orders in the fourth quarter of 2025.The ramp-up of ROSIE  a breakthrough technology in silicon-integrated photonics  is being confirmed with the sale of the first two units  validating the growing interest from laboratories and industrial players for solutions compatible with silicon production lines.Given the visibility of its order book deliverable in 2025 and the opportunities for its equipment and services  RIBER confirms its target of revenues above €40m for the full year.Agenda: 2025 full-year revenues on February 2  2026  before the start of trading.The condensed consolidated half-year accounts have not been subject to an audit or a limited review by the statutory auditors. They were approved by the Board of Directors on September 23  2025.

The audit procedures have been carried out.Fahd Khadraoui  Chief Executive Officer of MBWS  said: “Group revenues fell 8.5% in the first half amid sluggish market conditions. The decline is mainly due to the lack of price agreements for our William Peel Scotch brand with some customers in France  as well as stock adjustments imposed by some distributors  mainly in the United States.In the international market  we continue to develop our growth strategy in priority segments  as illustrated by our many commercial successes in International Strategic Brands (William Peel  Marie Brizard)  Flagship Local Brands  the distribution of Agency Brands with new contracts in Bulgaria and our Industrial Services offering. In fact  we have seen an 80-basis-point improvement in our consolidated gross margin  driven by our international operations  demonstrating the effectiveness of our cost control policy and commercial rigour.The current price adjustments are directly linked to inflation in the cost price of matured spirits and cannot be avoided. I would like to thank all the customers who are supporting us in this process. Meanwhile  we are maintaining constructive dialogue with those reluctant to accept the adjustments in order to achieve balanced commercial terms favourable to all parties.Despite these very negative impacts on our group's business  we were able to limit the decline in profitability.In line with our roadmap  we have continued to invest  primarily in industrial capacities and IT projects  while maintaining a comfortable net cash position. At the same time  we have rolled out the cost control program in the second half in order to safeguard our profitability and mitigate the impact of ongoing trade tensions. I remain confident in our people’s ability to face these headwinds and reach the necessary agreements with our customers to ensure a sustainable and balanced business recovery.”Simplified income statement - H1 2025€m except EPS H1 2024 H1 2025 Change2025 vs 2024 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 94.9 86.6 -8.5% Gross margin 36.2 33.7 -2.5 Gross margin ratio 38.1% 38.9% +0.8 pp EBITDA 8.5 5.9 -2.6 Underlying operating profit 5.2 3.0 -2.2 Net profit (Group share) 6.5 2.6 -3.9 Earnings per share 0.06 0.02First half 2025 revenuesFirst half 2025 revenues excluding excise duties came to €86.6m  down 8.5% versus H1 2024 (excluding currency impact). The drop in sales was mainly due to slower business in France amid the continuing decline in the spirits market.The France Cluster posted H1 2025 revenues of €35.1m  down 17.4% versus H1 2024. The deterioration was more pronounced in the second quarter (down 23.8% to €17.5m) due to particularly challenging annual negotiations with major retailers  mainly due to the price hikes required to offset considerable increases in the cost price of matured spirits.The delisting of the William Peel brand by some distributors curbed the total consolidated revenues of the first half by 6.3%  despite the agreements signed with an overwhelming majority of retailers. Marie Brizard sales were driven by the listing of innovations in the major retail and out-of-home sectors and a strong first half performance from all portfolio brands in the out-of-home sector.The International Cluster posted H1 2025 revenues of €51.4m  down 1.3% versus H1 2024. Q2 2025 sales fell more sharply  down 5.6% versus Q2 2024 to €26.8m amid contrasting developments across business segments and regions:Industrial Services continued to grow in Spain and Lithuania but experienced a temporary downturn in Bulgaria towards the end of the quarter;In the United States  the second quarter saw a sharp decline  mainly due to a mass reduction in inventories decided unilaterally by our importer  combined with a comparison with an abnormally high situation in 2024 linked to changes in distributors. The impact of this reduction in inventories is an estimated 2.4% decline in total consolidated revenues of first half 2025;Export markets remain stable despite a low comparison base in 2024  with some European markets struggling. However  business returned to growth in the second quarter in Canada  with strong growth in Poland but a continued decline in shipments to the Asia Pacific region.First half 2025 earningsThe Gross margin ratio was 38.9% in H1 2025 compared to 38.1% in H1 2024. The 80 bp improvement comes from the activity of the International Cluster. It reflects the proactive approach adopted to controlling costs and seeking productivity  coupled with a policy of commercial rigour as seen in the price adjustments applied to offset the significant increases in the cost price of matured spirits.First half 2025 EBITDA amounted to €5.9m  down €2.6m versus H1 2024 (excluding currency impact).France Cluster EBITDA came to €3.7m in H1 2025  down from €6.1m in H1 2024  reflecting the decline in sales over the first half of the year and the increase in the cost price of matured spirits  despite improved control over production and structural costs.The International Cluster posted first half EBITDA up €0.6m to €4.7m. Profitability plummeted in the United States in line with the sharp decline in sales. However  this development was more than offset by the improvement in profitability among the Spanish and Lithuanian subsidiaries  mainly driven by brisk business in Industrial Services and a strong performance from International Strategic Brands.Group EBITDA was also impacted by a €0.8m fall in holding company first half income  H1 2024 income were bolstered by non-recurring income and more substantial operating foreign exchange gains.H1 2025 EBITDA by Cluster€m H1 2024 LFL change Currencyimpact H1 2025 LFL change(excl. currencyimpact) Reportedgrowth (incl. currencyimpact) France 6.1 (2.4) - 3.7 -39.1% -39.1% International 4.1 0.6 0.0 4.7 +13.8% +14.3% Holding company (1.8) (0.8) - (2.6) -45.2% -45.2% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 8.5 (2.6) 0.0 5.9 -31% -30.8%First half net profit  Group share amounted to €2.6m  down €3.9m versus H1 2024. This deterioration is due to the decline in operating profit and financial income  which  although still positive  followed the overall decrease in interest rates over the period on the Group's cash investments.Balance sheet at 30 June 2025Shareholders’ equity (Group share) amounted to €214.8m at 30 June 2025  compared with €213.6m at 31 December 2024  while gross debt fell to €6.9m and gross cash and cash equivalents were down €5.3m at 30 June 2025. Net cash amounted to €43.8m at 30 June 2025  compared with €48.4m at 31 December 2024.Inventory and work-in-progress totalled €51.9m at 30 June 2025  up €3.3m versus 31 December 2024. The change reflects the significant decline in sales  particularly in the wake of the first quarter commercial negotiations in France  which had a negative short-term impact on cash; despite an immediate response and rapid adjustments on purchasing  a slight time lag caused an increase in inventory levels at the end of June. It should be noted that customer receivables were down compared to 30 June 2024.Industrial investments generated a €4.1m cash outflow over the first half.OutlookThe Group is committed to setting the stage for profitable and sustainable growth in its business portfolio and strengthening its presence in key markets by leveraging its distribution networks  industrial footprint and strategic business segments. The overall resilience of its mainstream brands has been demonstrated by combining targeted initiatives  agile commercial execution and rigorous cost management.2025 will be a year of transition for the Group  against a backdrop of persisting tension in the global wine and spirits markets coupled with limited  volatile commercial visibility. This situation was confirmed in July by the introduction of further tariff hikes in trade with the United States.In response to the significant impact of inflation in the cost price of matured spirits  particularly Scotch whisky and more marginally cognac  the Group has taken steps to minimise the fallout and best preserve its financial performance in France and on international markets. These steps involved:- price adjustments to offset significant increases in cost prices  without which the economic performance of the France Cluster could be more significantly affected;- measures to protect profitability by putting greater emphasis and control on reducing certain expenses  accelerating productivity projects and implementing appropriate commercial initiatives with positive short-term effects.The Group continues to make every effort and maintain ongoing dialogue to mitigate the impact of the commercial tensions of recent months  particularly with certain major retailers in the French market. The objective is to achieve a recovery in business activity that is beneficial to all stakeholders and is based on fair and acceptable commercial terms.At the same time  the Group is relying on all its strategic levers to face these headwinds  in particular by diversifying its offering via the development of Industrial Services and the distribution of Agency Brands  two segments that are performing well and demonstrating real growth potential. The Group also remains focused on its roadmap  particularly in terms of profitable investment  innovation and sustainable transition  while maintaining vigilance in adapting its range to the elasticity of consumer demand.Lastly  the Group is actively pursuing the identification of relevant and profitable growth opportunities  both organic and external  by galvanising initiatives within its two clusters with a view to long-term development and the consolidation of the wine and spirits market.Financial calendarPublication of revenues for the first nine months of 2025: 23 October 2025Investor and shareholder relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexlerrelations.actionnaires@mbws.comTel.: +33 1 43 91 62 40 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr – lpoinsot@image7.frTel.: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the United States.

We have put in place the US infrastructure to support this launch  including a team of ten focused on this key activity for Sequana Medical. We are delighted with the strong interest among the US clinical and patient community for the alfapump as a breakthrough in the treatment of a condition that has been overlooked for far too long.

Formal transfer to manufacturing was completed and the alfa pump systems for the Soft Launch have been manufactured. The initial US team of seven individuals has been recruited and they are supported by three further European team members dedicated to the US. The Company is very pleased with the strong interest from US clinicians for alfa pump as a new treatment option for their patients and discussions are underway with more than ten US hospitals to complete the necessary approvals and contracting to commence alfa pump implants. Seven hospitals have completed alfa pump training for hepatologists  interventional radiologists and their teams. Awareness is spreading among both the hepatology and interventional radiology communities in the US and the alfa pump has been or will be imminently profiled in three podium presentations at clinical conferences.

The NTAP will be in effect from October 1  2025 and provides “top-up” reimbursement of up to $21 450  in addition to the hospital’s Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through its specialty commercial team that will target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform more than 90% of liver transplants. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements7. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
