That’s not going to happen  let me be very clear about that ” he stressed.Western countries have long sought to tap into the frozen funds to bankroll Kiev  with attempts to do so repeatedly frustrated by lack of a legal mechanism and broader concerns about the implications. Last year  the G7 backed a plan to use the accrued interest to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine – with the EU pledging $21 billion and disbursing about half so far.Moscow has repeatedly condemned the asset freeze and any effort to seize or redirect Russian funds as a violation of international law and undermining trust in the global financial system. Russia has also pledged it would retaliate  adding that further military and financial aid to Ukraine only prolongs hostilities.,neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,negative,0.0,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU state', 'Ukraine loan', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'central bank money', 'UN General Assembly', 'global financial system', 'new German plan', 'immobilized assets', 'frozen funds', 'Russian funds', 'New York', 'financial aid', 'Russian reserves', 'other nations', 'interest-free loan', 'unusual weight', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'European politicians', 'legal mechanism', 'broader concerns', 'asset freeze', 'international law', 'Western countries', 'Putin', 'bloc', 'Belgium', 'brakes', 'Ukraine', 'veto', 'keys', 'vault', 'Thursday', 'proposal', 'Kiev', 'warning', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'eurozone', 'dangerous', 'risks', 'attempts', 'lack', 'implications', 'G7', 'loans', 'half', 'effort', 'violation', 'trust', 'military', 'hostilities']",2025-09-26,2025-09-27,rt.com

For that to work  all or most of the other countries would have to agree.“This would require a high-level political agreement by all or most Heads of State or Government ” the Commission said in a note to EU ambassadors meeting on Friday.Not just HungaryWinning that broader agreement will not be easy. There are other Russia-friendly nations in the potential mix  such as Slovakia.Then there's the Belgium problem. The Belgian government has already pushed back amid concerns that the EU’s cash grab could expose Belgium and Euroclear  a financial institution that houses Russia’s frozen state assets  to legal retaliation from Moscow.,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Brussels eyes loophole', 'Russian assets', 'Hungary', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'European Council conclusions', 'high-level political agreement', 'other Russia-friendly nations', 'other countries', 'broader agreement', 'Four people', 'Orbán', 'new argument', 'sufficient cover', 'sanctions rules', 'qualified majority', 'most Heads', 'potential mix', 'cash grab', 'financial institution', 'legal retaliation', 'EU ambassadors', 'Euroclear bank', 'Belgian government', 'war effort', 'The Commission', 'Belgium problem', 'EU leaders', 'state assets', 'plans', 'POLITICO', 'action', 'Dec.', 'statement', 'aggression', 'Ukraine', 'damage', 'time', 'interest', 'unanimity', 'note', 'Friday', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'concerns', 'Moscow']",2025-09-26,2025-09-27,politico.eu

Berlin's st…,"Amid all the threats and counterthreats related to warnings NATO is prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft this week  Germany has in a major policy U-turn  called for the European Union to use frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's defense.Berlin's stance the whole time Europe has tried to gain consensus on this issue was marked by prior reluctance  but German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in a newly published op-ed for the Financial Times said the bloc needs to urgently establish a legal framework through which to unlock the assets  calling it essential to ""systematically and massively raise the costs of Russia's aggression.""He laid out his plea for the loan to be directed toward military aid  with procurement decisions made jointly by EU member states and Ukraine  based on utilizing the €194 billion in frozen Russian assets held at Euroclear  Belgium’s central securities depository.The fact that Germany  as Europe's largest econom y is now on board is likely to both vigorously renew the debate and give fresh momentum to the hawks. Recall that a big European holdout remains France and President Emmanuel Macron  who said in Sunday interview with CBS News that confiscating frozen Russian assets would constitute a violation of international law.Macron  already facing a political crisis at home  tried put a lid on these discussions. ""You cannot seize these assets from the (Russian) Central Bank even in such a situation. And I think it's a matter of credibility  and it's very important that our countries remain... and do respect the international laws "" he said.And so this has left European governments and G7 allies exploring ways to generate revenue from these immobilized funds without outright seizing them  which would have legal and political ramifications  as well as 'blowback' as much of the globe's trust in Western institutions would further erode.The Kremlin has already long warned that any such use of its frozen assets ""will not go unanswered"". But this is not scaring Merz away  who newly argues that Europe must demonstrate ""greater staying power"" in the war in order to force the Kremlin to the negotiating table while giving Kiev more leverage.Merz wrote that ""This must not hold us back"" in reference to the lingering legal hurdles  urging the EU to consider ""circumventing these problems.""""I am advocating the mobilization of financial resources on a scale that will secure Ukraine’s military resilience for several years "" he spelled out. He outlined the following plan:The German chancellor is now seeking to use $160 billion in a loan for Kyiv. The sum would be made available to Ukraine as an interest-free loan that would be ""repaid once Russia has compensated Ukraine for the damage"" the war has caused....Under Merz’ proposal  Ukraine would only be allowed to use the funds for the procurement of weapons  and not for budgetary purposes.The payments to Kyiv would be made in instalments and EU states  in conjunction with Ukraine  would then determine ""which material is procured."" Merz added that he felt this mechanism would also help to ""strengthen and expand"" Europe’s own defense industry.In essence it would involve taking billions of euros of Russian state cash held in Belgium  transferring it to Ukraine  and then replacing the drawdown with EU-backed bonds.BREAKING: Danish media reveals that a Russian Navy Ropucha-class landing ship  Aleksandr Shabalin has been spotted by helicopter ~12 km off southern Langeland/Lolland in Denmark with its AIS transponder switched off.

Revenue showed strong growth (+16.5% like-for-like to €7.7m) while current operating profit reached break-even. These factors contributed to an additional dilutive effect of 0.4% on the Division's average profitability.Pharmagest Germany  acquired in November 2023  grew 11.2% like-for-like to €3.0m. The Business Unit is reaping the rewards from sustained sales and marketing efforts  which are temporarily impacting margins (-€0.7m) and increasing the dilutive effect by 0.4% on the Division's average level of profitability.Trends for the profit margins of the established French businesses continue to remain positive.The new infrastructure for health data hosting services that came on line in Q4 2024 is now subject to depreciation charges  adversely impacting the Division's average margin of 0.5%.AXIGATE LINK Division : stable current operating profit (€4.4m) with a lower margin (COP/sales): 26.5% for H1 2025 vs. 28.6% for H1 2024)The Division's main sectors (nursing homes for dependent seniors  in-home nursing care and hospitals) are continuing to experience strong growth in relation to their respective sectors (+6.7% like-for-like to €16.5m).To support the expansion of activities in England  the migration of the Nursing Home portfolio to a SaaS business model (TitanLink) and the development of offerings for new markets in the home care sector (Regional Resource Centres and in-Home Nursing Assistants) R&D and sales teams have been significantly strengthened.The Division’s average profitability decreased to 26.5% but remains at a very favourable level when compared with the performance of other market players.E-CONNECT division : growth in current operating profit (€2.7m) and a lower current operating margin (COP/sales): 36.0% for H1 2025 vs. 45.9% for H1 2024)The significant growth in H1 revenue (+36.6% like-for-like to €7.5m) was driven mainly by the Division's mobile solutions and  to a lesser extent  the roll-out of the French health insurance card app which is directly dependent on the calendar for implementation of the French national health insurance.Gross margins by revenue category were stable compared with H1 2024.Reflecting a less favourable revenue mix  the Division's gross margin declined 12.2%.To maintain the Division's technological lead as a provider of healthcare connectivity solutions  R&D costs  in the form of personnel expenses and amortisation of intangible assets  are continuing to rise steadily.The success of the new offerings with most publishers confirms the relevance of the Division's strategy.MEDICAL SOLUTIONS Division : growth in current operating profit (€0.3m) and improved current operating margin (COP/sales: 6.7% for H1 2025 vs. 0.4% for H1 2024)The Division's significant revenue growth (+29.1% to €5.1m on a reported basis) was driven mainly by the integration of Calimed and its SaaS offering for surgeons and doctors.The Division's legacy solutions grew revenue by 2.2% (organic growth) in response to the introduction of new functionalities proposed on a subscription-bases (voice-controlled AI).Reflecting Calimed’s slight marginal current operating loss of €0.1m  the dilutive effect of the Business Unit on the Division's average margin was 4.3%.FINTECH division: operating loss of €0.3mThe Division's sales were down in H1 (-7.6% to €1.0m) against the backdrop of an unfavourable economic climate.The Business Unit's results were again impacted by a €0.15m impairment of accounts receivable.H1 2025 consolidated balance sheet highlightsCash flow after interest and tax rose by 18.8% to €24.8m in H1 2025.Investment levels are in line with Group standards at €6.1m.There were no external growth operations or related financing operations in the first half.Borrowings and financial debt repayments amounted to €11.9m for the first half of the year  including €2.0m relating to the IFRS 16 restatement.Gross cash (including current and non-current financial assets and related interest) increased by €9.4m to €136.7m.The financial surplus (gross cash less borrowings) rose by €19.2m to €98.8m.Material subsequent events after 30 June 2025 Acquisition of the DIS and ResUrgences businesses - Strategic reinforcement of the AXIGATE LINK DivisionOn July1  2025  the Group finalized the acquisition of two businesses specialising in solutions for the public healthcare sector: Novaprove (publisher of ResUrgences software) and the business assets of DIS. This strategic acquisition which added more than 300 customers from the public healthcare sector significantly strengthened the position of the Axigate Link Division in the hospital and medical-social software market.ResUrgences  a cloud platform specialising in the management of hospital emergency services  used by eight university hospitals and 75 other establishments  and the DIS range representing a comprehensive suite of digital solutions used by 215 sites (125 healthcare establishments and 90 nursing homes)  further enhance the Division's existing offering. The integration of these new functional modules (Electronic Patient Records  invoicing  accounting  inventory management  and HR) into the Hospilink  Titanlink and Domilink ranges will create a comprehensive ecosystem to support the digital transformation of public and private institutions  in line with the Group's ambition to become the leading technology partner for the French healthcare system.The estimated contribution of the acquired businesses to Group revenue is 1.3% starting in Q3 and onwards.2025 outlookThe Group maintains its guidance for growth on a reported basis of nearly 10% in H2 2025.This will be driven mainly by organic growth  plus a modest contribution from recent acquisitions.Backed by a solid financial structure  the Group will continue to monitor potential opportunities for external growth.Financial calendar:5 November 2025: Publication of Q3 2025 revenue5 February 2026: Publication of FY 2025 revenueAbout Equasens GroupFounded over 35 years ago  Equasens Group  a leader in digital healthcare solutions  today employs over 1.300 people across Europe.Equasens Group’s specialised business applications facilitate the day-to-day work of healthcare professionals and their teams  working in private practice  collaborative medical structures or healthcare establishments.

At the time  it was expected that the transaction would be completed in the third quarter of 2025  subject to various regulatory approvals.Since the buyer has not received all necessary approvals  there is currently no realistic prospect of completing the transaction in the third quarter. We continue working towards completing the transaction and our exit from the Russian market and expect the financial impact not to be materially different from what was reported earlier. With our 2Q2025 results in July we reported an expected negative P&L impact of around €0.8 billion post tax. This includes an estimated book loss of €0.5 billion and €0.3 billion from recycling the currency translation adjustment through P&L that is currently booked in equity for past changes of the value of ING Bank (Eurasia) JSC as a result of exchange rate movements. The sale is expected to have a negative impact of ~7 basis points on ING’s CET1 ratio.Since February 2022  we have taken on no new business with Russian companies  have scaled down operations and have taken actions to separate our business in Russia from ING’s networks and systems. We will continue to further reduce our offshore exposure to Russian clients. This exposure  which is booked by ING entities outside of Russia  has decreased by over 85% to €0.7 billion as of 30 June 2025  of which €0.3 billion is under ECA or CPRI cover.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

These results are driven by the improved performance in the United States  the reorganization of the business portfolio in Europe and strengthened operational efficiency.The group is thus initiating its financial recovery  which will continue into FY 2025-2026  fueled by the growth of its brands and the ongoing improvement of operational excellence  in a European context disrupted by imports of products from China benefiting from dumping measures*.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In accordance with IFRS 5 accounting standards  the income statements relating to the packaged salad activity in France and Germany  whose planned disposal was announced on August 29  2024 and effective since July 17  2025 for the French activity and March 31  2025 for Germany  are gathered in the income statement of the reported financial statements under the heading “net income from discontinued operations”.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*****On September 26  2025  the Supervisory Board  under the chairmanship of Jean-Pierre Vannier  reviewed the statutory and consolidated financial statements for FY 2024-2025 as approved by the General Management and certified by the company's statutory Auditors.*****Financial Performance(in millions of euros) 2024-2025 2023-2024IFRS 5 restated Variationat constant exchange rates and scope 2023-2024reported Sales 2 203.8 2 223.4 -0.8% 2 371.7 Current Operating Income 83.8 83.4 +0.2% 75.3 Net income from continuing operations 19.7 -108.1 -119.8 Net income -11.5 -119.8 -119.8The Bonduelle Group’s sales for fiscal year 2024-2025 (ended June 30  2025) amounted to 2 203.8 million euros  a variation of -0.8% on a like-for-like basis(1) and -0.9% on reported figures compared with FY 2023-2024.Current operating income amounted to 83.8 million euros  up slightly (+0.2%) compared with the previous fiscal year  and the current operating margin also increased to 3.8% compared with 3.7% for the previous FY  after taking into account the IFRS 5 restatement.

They reflect the return to normal volumes sold under private labels and the sustained growth of the Cassegrain brand in France.The fresh processed activities maintained in the portfolio (packaged salads activity in Italy  and prepared segment in France and Italy) posted  for the whole period  increases in both volumes and value in all segments. Quarter 4 was particularly buoyant in France in the prepared segment  thanks to a good trend of recently launched innovations. Favorable weather conditions in spring and early summer helped to support the fresh prepared segment.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone  representing 38.5% of the business activity over FY 2024-2025  rose by +4.9% on a like-for-like basis(1) (+4.4% on reported figures). In Quarter 4  increases were respectively of +1.7% on a like-for-like basis(1) and +0.4% on reported figures.Overall FY 2024-2025  business activity in North America returned to growth with +4.8% on a like-for-like basis(1) (+4.9% on reported figures). It is driven by the ongoing progress in complete meal solutions (bowls)  which posted growth of over +10% in both volumes and value  over the entire period. The Eurasia and Emerging Markets region confirmed its role as key player for growth over FY  with an increase of +5.5% on a like-for-like basis(1) (+3.8% on reported figures)  particularly boosted by the excellent performance of activities in the Eurasia region.Operating Income(in millions of euros) 2024-2025 2023-2024IFRS 5 restated Variationat current exchange rates Variationat constant exchange rates and scope Sales 2 203.8 2 223.4 -0.9% -0.8% Current operating income 83.8 83.4 +0.5% +0.2% Current operating margin rate 3.8% 3.7% +5 bpsFor FY 2024-2025  the Bonduelle Group posted a current operating income of 83.8 million euros at current exchange rates and 83.5 million euros at constant exchange rates  compared with 83.4 million euros in the previous fiscal year after restatement of discontinued operations or held for disposal.This result is in line with the objective of stability announced at the beginning of fiscal year. Including discontinued operations and operations held for disposal  the reported current operating income for FY 2023-2024 amounted to 75.3 million euros. The current operating margin stood at 3.8% on both like-for-like basis(1) and reported figures  also stable on a comparable basis and up 60 basis points compared to previous year’s reported figures.The stability in current operating profitability reflects the following developments and contributions:In Europe Zone  profitability declined due to lower prices and lower volumes in private labels caused by high inventory levels on the market and imports from China. In the meantime  the fresh processed activities in France and Italy  as well as the Bonduelle and Cassegrain brands  showed a strong momentum In the Non-Europe Zone  the improvement in current operating profitability (+10.9 million euros on a like-for-like basis (1) ) mainly reflects the ongoing recovery of Bonduelle Americas’ profitability  driven by its operating performance and the development of branded activities and the increase in profitability in the Eurasia region ) mainly reflects the ongoing recovery of Bonduelle Americas’ profitability  driven by its operating performance and the development of branded activities and the increase in profitability in the Eurasia region  Across the whole group  operational efficiency programs and rigorous management of structural costs are important contributors Marketing investments for the fiscal year increased by 8% in line with the priority objective of developing branded products’ sales.The performance of FY 2024-2025 is therefore in line with the objective announced in October 2024 when the “Transform to win” transformation plan was presented.After taking into account non-recurring items of -10.8 million euros over the period  mainly consisting of quick-return logistics optimizations in the United States on one hand  and restructuring and reorganization costs on the other hand  the Bonduelle Group’s operating income amounted to 73 million euros on reported figures  compared with -56.4 million euros for previous FY. Previous fiscal year’s operating income included impairment losses on intangible assets in the United States.Net income from continuing operationsNet financial income amounted to -35.1 million euros  compared to -34 million euros at the end of previous fiscal year. The posted interest expense for the period is quite stable at -32.3 million euros  an average outstanding debt higher than the previous FY  offset by an improvement in the group's financing rate (3.81% compared to 4.39%)  with foreign exchange result amounting to -2 million euros compared to +0.3 million euros for the previous fiscal year.Tax expense came to -20.1 million euros  compared with 21.3 million euros in the previous fiscal year  the effective tax rate (53.1%)  remains distorted by the non-activated losses from the North American business activities.Income from associates amounts to 2 million euros corresponding to the share of income from Nortera Foods accounted for under the equity method.After taking into account financial income  tax expense and income from associates  Bonduelle Group’s net income from continuing operations  2024-2025 fiscal year amounted to 19.7 million euros compared with -108.1 million euros the previous fiscal year  representing 0.9% of sales.Consolidated net incomeIn accordance with IFRS 5  contributions from activities of packaged salads in France and Italy being discontinued or held for disposal  are gathered under the heading “net income from discontinued operations”.

This activity  structurally loss-making and representing annual sales of approximately 60 million euros is recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements of the year ended June 30  2025  in accordance with IFRS standards.Furthermore  on July 17  2025  the group completed the disposal of its packaged salad business in France to the LSDH Group  after several years of declining results in this segment. This transaction  representing sales of 78.8 million euros  will be reflected in the FY 2025-2026 financial statements.These two disposals enable the Bonduelle Group to focus its resources on developing its higher value-added activities  particularly the fresh prepared activity in Europe  while maintaining the Bonduelle brand's presence in the bagged salad segment through licensing agreements with the buyers.Annual General Meeting on December 4  2025 - DividendDuring the Annual General meeting to be held on December 4  2025 a dividend of 0.25 euro per share will be proposed.OutlookFor this FY 2025-2026  the group is entering the second year of its transformation plan launched in 2023-2024  capitalizing on the foundation of initiatives implemented last year.In a climate where consumption is likely to remain under pressure  the group confirms its objective for 2025-2026 of a recovery in current operating profitability to 90 million euros on a like-for-like basis(1). This objective will be sustained by growth in branded activities  improved agro-industrial performance  and control of structural and overhead costs while pursuing its ambitious programs of positive impact.* https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202501723(1) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

To be honest  I didn’t see a politician who is collapsing—generally  or specifically because of the cancellation of his meeting with Erdogan. After all  as you can see  Erdogan has his own issues (he did the same with Meloni)  and he tends to flare up with everyone and everything—including  of course  our “planetarch.” But of course  there’s a difference between POTUS  the leader of the planet  and the local dictator of the region. In any case  we’ll see whether this “non-meeting” will stir up the calm waters and make them murky—to borrow the (nice) headline of Kathimerini yesterday. But how else can I put it? Watch Mitsotakis speak and behave  even when things aren’t going entirely his way (c’est la vie  as he himself said)  and compare him with the alternative… Nikos A. of PASOK  the “I’m ready” guy  or whomever else you want. Then go to sleep calmly about what tomorrow may bring. Now  you might say: what’s going to happen—will we enter an era of “Karamanlis or tanks ” but this time as “Mitsotakis or chaos”? The truth is  no one knows. Anyway  I think we’ve got a long road ahead until the end—which is  of course  the elections.10 trillion with Mitsotakis at the AmanA big investment breakfast  with K.M. at the center and 25 representatives of major American companies  funds  banks  and insurance institutions  was held yesterday at the Aman Hotel in New York. The names—and especially the value of assets managed by these players—are truly huge. In total  we’re talking about roughly $10 trillion (!) in assets. The discussion included new players as well as very senior executives of organizations already known to the government. Here’s the list: Capital Group  with assets worth about $3.3 trillion; JP Morgan Asset Management  $3.7 trillion; Morgan Stanley Investment Management  $1.7 trillion; and many more. For example: Paulson & Co.  Point 72 Asset  Oakhill Advisors (with “only” $100 billion in assets)  Lazard  etc. The gathering was organized by George Linatsas of Axia Ventures in collaboration with K.M.’s investment adviser Dimitris Politis (formerly of HRADF). Topics of interest included technology  artificial intelligence  and many Greek startups  as well as infrastructure—not only traditional infrastructure  but also AI-linked infrastructure (energy  data centers  etc.).The meeting with pharmaceutical executivesIn a more closed circle  K.M. also had a meeting with 10–12 CEOs and senior executives of major pharmaceutical and life science companies. The meeting  held at Pfizer’s offices  was co-organized by Albert Bourla (no further introductions needed) and Marc Casper of Thermo Fisher Scientific  which is a giant American biosciences and clinical research company. It’s worth noting that Casper  who is already investing in Greece  had been at the Maximos Mansion two weeks ago with his vice president  Gianluca Pettiti. Greece is seen as a reference country for many of these companies and also has a “good name” thanks to the quality of its human capital.The Atlantic Council menuStill in the U.S.  K.M. also visited the Atlantic Council  where he had his first meeting with the new ambassador  Ms. Gilfoyle  who will arrive in Greece by mid-October. A roundtable discussion was held  with representatives of Gulf countries  including Anwar Mohammed Gargash  diplomatic adviser to the president of the UAE  representatives of several companies active in the Middle East  and others that “play ball” at a global consulting level. Also participating: UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy and the EU’s representative to the Gulf  Luigi Di Maio. From the Greek side  Mitsotakis was accompanied by Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou. The discussion was moderated by Fred Kempe  president and CEO of the Atlantic Council  along with Theodoros Kyriakou  president of Antenna Group.Time to get rid of the “brat ” No. 2I wrote a few days ago that my source told me: anyone who goes to Karamanlis’ office (Rafina) for a coffee—what else would they do  anyway—with the former prime minister  won’t have to wait long before hearing him rant against Mitsotakis  saying: “Get rid of that brat (or something like that)  and let anyone else come.” Now I add this: another major personality of Rafina-Karamanlism  former President Prokopis [Pavlopoulos]  speaks with the highest praise for Karystianou. Next to him  along with… the rest of the gang  Nikos Karachalios and Giannis Loulis complete the dream team. Now  of course  their shared hatred for the “brat” unites them  even though a “sentimental bypass” may be needed  since Karystianou and the surname Karamanlis don’t exactly align. But I wonder: if all these enemies of Mitsotakis do form parties—Samaras  Karystianou  Tsipras—who will they leave behind  and who will they side with? Something like… “Between Kiki and Coco  I just can’t choose.”Developments with Routsis?The hunger strike of Panos Routsis continues  and if you noticed yesterday Floridis’ statement that  under certain conditions  even the legal notice (exodiko) could be interpreted as a request for exhumation  I would say don’t ignore it. I understand that within the judiciary there is some movement regarding the evaluation of the situation and the available legal margins. Of course  exhumation and further investigative actions—such as toxicological examinations  etc.—are two different things and require two separate judicial decisions. Further investigative actions definitely require a decision by the President of the Larissa Court of Appeal  as was clarified recently by the “heads” of the judiciary. However  a simple exhumation to confirm identity through DNA can—at least theoretically—proceed more immediately.The deputy minister’s weddingYesterday’s press conference about the GovGr Wallet revealed  in addition to its new features  a wedding: that of Deputy Minister of Digital Governance Christos Dermendzopoulos  who will tie the knot on Saturday. The happy news was revealed by Minister Papastergiou while he was speaking about certificates  noting that—although the groom is a Member of Parliament for Evros—the ceremony will take place in Athens  since the bride is from there. From this column: may their life together be blessed!How Israelis are boosting Greek real estateIt is now a recorded trend in the Greek real estate market. Investors from Israel show a +70% increase compared to last year  having already obtained 271 Golden Visas—and the year still has a few months to go. Athens dominates the investment landscape  representing about 68% of all Israeli real estate acquisitions in Greece. Preferences focus on neighborhoods such as Kolonaki  Koukaki  and Metaxourgeio  which offer profitable short-term rental opportunities. Crete is the next most popular destination  especially for luxury villas near Chania and Rethymno. The shift of Israelis toward Greece is no coincidence: a 100-square-meter apartment in central Athens may cost them around $332 000. That’s about one-third the cost of a similar apartment in Tel Aviv  where prices are climbing alongside mortgage interest rates. Greece offers stability  a favorable tax framework  and significant capital gains—within a beautiful Mediterranean environment attractive to wealthy Israelis.Greek shipowners start to feel the squeeze with LNG carriersConcerns appear to be spreading among the circles of Greek shipowners with fleets of LNG carriers  following a new study by the UCL Energy Institute and the Kuehne Climate Center. According to the findings  global investments worth $48 billion in LNG vessels risk turning into “stranded assets” by 2035  as an oversupply of capacity is expected. Greek shipowners had entered the LNG market aggressively over the past decade  viewing liquefied natural gas as the bridge fuel of the energy transition. But the new research shows that  unlike crude oil or LPG tankers that have alternative uses  LNG carriers are one-dimensional and difficult to adapt to other cargo. This means that if forecasts of declining demand are confirmed  the value of their fleets could come under sharp pressure. Now  with freight rates already below sustainable levels and international markets warning of oversupply—that is  too many ships—there are whispers that some big players in the sector are reviewing their obligations with banks more often than they’d like. A Greek shipowner managing LNG carriers said that his books still forecast rising demand  but the problem is that ship competition is increasing  so freight rates will fall. Overall  Greek shipowners control 169 LNG carriers  representing 24.5% of global capacity in deadweight tons (dwt)  while also being involved in shipbuilding programs. Maria Angelicoussis – Maran Gas has 15 on order. George Prokopiou – Dynagas is running a program with 14 LNG carriers. Anna Angelicoussis – Alpha Gas has four. Peter Livanos – GasLog is building two  as is Andreas A. Martinos Jr.AEGEAN: Entering winter with +10% in available seatsLet’s move on to aviation news  starting with AEGEAN  which is entering the winter season with 10% more available seats compared to last year—driven by the continuing and growing appetite of Greeks for more travel. In an effort to spread traffic beyond the peak summer tourism season  the group also plans to continue several important direct routes that launched during summer. Among them  as AEGEAN’s Chief Ground Operations Officer Panos Nikolaidis mentioned in his speech  are Heraklion–Munich and Heraklion–Constantinople  while new direct flights will begin from Thessaloniki Airport to destinations such as Prague and Constantinople. As for the fleet—where  as is well known  the total Airbus 320/321neo order amounts to 60 aircraft—39 have already been delivered. Among them are four Airbus A321neo LR and two Airbus A321neo XLR  with even greater range  which will serve  among other routes  the new connections to New Delhi and Mumbai.Fraport Greece: Sit back (and collect dividends)Continuing with aviation news  Fraport Greece “A” decided  at its extraordinary general meeting on September 22  to distribute a total dividend of €30 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2024. Fraport Greece “A” controls the first of the two clusters of regional airports under the group’s management  with 7 airports in its umbrella. The amounts are allocated €9 million for 2023 and €21 million for 2024—a year during which the 14 regional airports handled 36.03 million passengers  an increase of 6.36% (+2.15 million passengers) compared to 2023 levels. For this year  passenger traffic growth is estimated at +2.5% to 3%. Fraport Greece “A” is responsible for the operation of the airports of Aktio  Zakynthos  Kavala  Thessaloniki  Corfu  Kefalonia  and Chania. Passenger traffic at these airports in 2024 was higher than in 2023  up 5.75%  reaching a total of 19.89 million passengers.Euronext: Visits to Athens  but cards kept closeThey come and come again  meeting with many people. Euronext executives have been holding systematic discussions with the management of listed companies on the Athens Stock Exchange  with Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) shareholders  and with ATHEX management itself. All indications are that Euronext will soon file with the Hellenic Capital Market Commission the Prospectus for its public offer. While the meetings are ongoing  for now Euronext has not yet revealed its hand  so we don’t know what percentage of ATHEX it intends to pursue. The executives’ sense after the meetings  however  is that listed companies on the ASE are positive toward the prospect of an acquisition.Aktor unaffected by the placementThe divestment of Intracom Holdings from Aktor took place at a price of €7.2 per share  but this only temporarily affected the trajectory of the latter’s stock  which remains on track for multi-year highs. A few minutes after the two large blocks worth €74.7 million in total for 5.09% of Intracom were transacted  Aktor slipped below €8. But it quickly rebounded  closing at €8.19 with a gain of 0.24%. Intraday it reached €8.24—a record high not seen since August 2007  18 years ago.Lamda Development hits €8Riding the momentum from the previous day’s 4.8% jump  Lamda Development continued its upward trajectory for the third consecutive session  and hasn’t posted a negative close since September 17. With a turnover of €8.1 million and volume above 1 million shares  it climbed to €7.82  refreshing its four-year high. Although it closed below the intraday highs  at one point it reached €8—a milestone not achieved since September 2021.EYDAP’s disappointing results and 4 hours of complaintsThe board meeting of EYDAP the day before yesterday lasted more than four hours  ultimately confirming and approving very poor half-year results. Cost of goods sold increased by €15 million. Cash reserves dropped by €30 million (without dividend distribution). Despite its oligopolistic market position  the company posted a loss-making half year. Unsurprisingly  discussions within the board were particularly tense. The main question hanging over the company concerns the reaction of major investor John Paulson  while minority representatives (Messrs. Skoularikis  Nistriotis) raised numerous remarks and objections to the financial statements. The market “rewarded” EYDAP’s stock with a -3.25% plunge to €6.85  dropping its market capitalization to €729.5 million. Incidentally  it’s been six months that EYDAP has been searching for a new head of finance without success. But never mind—after all  who said speed is everything…Avax’s RecordAvax pleasantly surprised the market as the financial results it posted in the first half of the year reached the highest levels in its history. The construction group reported record revenue of €467.5 million (+61%)  profit up 74%  and EBITDA +29% compared to the same period in 2024. The project backlog stood at €2.76 billion (as of the end of September 2025)  and as noted in the financial statements  the group has signed contracts worth €53 million after June 30  2025  while awaiting the results of several tenders for PPPs  private and public projects in Greece  as well as energy sector projects abroad. On the board  Avax’s share trades at 5x EV/EBITDA  with market capitalization now standing at €368 million.A Day of Many Small Bad NewsCorporate results (EYDAP  ADMIE  and JUMBO) disappointed. European stock markets were falling. On Wall Street  healthcare stocks suffered after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it had “launched new investigations  for national security reasons  regarding imports of personal protective equipment  medical supplies  robotics  and industrial machinery.” The U.S. central banker did not hesitate to speak of “overvalued stocks.” Then came the news of Russian planes over Alaska being intercepted by the U.S. Air Force  which tied together the bitter meal of yesterday’s session. The General Index traded permanently in negative territory and closed transactions near the day’s low (2 033.38 points) at 2 035.21 points  down -1.46%. Transaction value was impressive at €372.01 million  but €162.9 million of that came from block trades  the largest being €74.7 million from Intralot’s divestment via a placement by the AKTOR group. Once again  the absolute star of our stock market session was Alpha Bank’s share (+0.57% at €3.55)  which not only diverged from the negative signs of the other systemic banks but also stood out for the transaction volume that exceeded €88 million. National Bank (-0.98%) fought hard to limit losses at €12.15  Piraeus (-2.75%) ended at €7.14  and Eurobank (-2.32%) fell to €3.29. Among refiners  the day before it was Motor Oil; yesterday it was HelleniQ Energy’s (+0.41%) turn to benefit from strong refining margins  along with VIOHALCO (+0.28%) at €7.27.Decarbonization of Shipping Divides ShipownersAt the sidelines of a recent shipping event  the atmosphere resembled a political thriller. Greek shipowners and officials familiar with the workings of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) discussed with concern the upcoming vote on the full decarbonization of shipping. “It’s on the edge ” they repeated  implying that the required two-thirds majority of the 109 countries on the Committee would be difficult to achieve. Even a narrow approval with a slim 51%-49% margin would leave serious implementation issues. Criticism toward Europe was that it had “already taken a firm position ” leaving no room for retreat. Much harsher were the remarks aimed at the U.S.  with its stance described as “unacceptable” for avoiding meaningful negotiation and intervention  thus allowing the Organization to become divided. As experienced executives noted  pressure for “global measures” without universal consensus is dangerous for a global industry like shipping  which requires uniform rules. There was even the thought that it would be better to postpone the vote for six months and create an ad hoc working group to find more realistic solutions. “Otherwise  we risk not only unworkable measures but also a rift within the IMO itself ” commented a well-known Greek stakeholder. Another participant admitted: “This is a journey into the unknown – and that’s what is most frightening.”The Former Engine of EuropeThe latest forecasts indicate that the German economy is expected to shrink by -0.1% in 2025  following a -0.2% decline in 2024 and -0.3% in 2023. The once engine of the European economy suffers from insufficient investment in public infrastructure  higher energy costs after the cut-off of Russian natural gas (with prices still double pre-crisis levels)  intense competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers with superior battery technology and production scale  rising labor costs due to an aging population  and cumbersome bureaucracy. Indicatively  in Germany of 2025  obtaining a business license requires at least 120 days. All this is reflected in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The total market capitalization of the German stock market has shrunk from 2.4% to 2.1% of major global capital markets in just 3 months. Germany’s shrinking share of global capitalization is not just a numerical phenomenon but reflects the deeper crisis of an economic model that relied on cheap energy  export advantage  and industrial superiority – elements now under question.,negative,0.01,0.37,0.62,mixed,0.21,0.19,0.6,True,English,"['K.M.', 'investment breakfast', 'real estate', '25 funds', 'Prokopis', 'Karachalios', 'Loulis', 'rest', 'gang', 'Israelis', 'snakes', 'LNG', 'UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy', 'JP Morgan Asset Management', 'Morgan Stanley Investment Management', 'Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou', 'Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ TV interview', 'former President Prokopis [Pavlopoulos', 'former prime minister', 'The Atlantic Council menu', 'Wall Street Journal', 'big investment breakfast', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific', 'clinical research company', 'Anwar Mohammed Gargash', 'global consulting level', 'Luigi Di Maio', 'giant American biosciences', 'many Greek startups', 'life science companies', 'major American companies', 'Point 72 Asset', 'investment adviser', 'American journalist', 'Greek side', 'major pharmaceutical', 'major personality', 'several companies', 'local dictator', 'calm waters', 'nice) headline', 'Nikos A.', 'long road', 'K.M.', 'insurance institutions', 'New York', 'senior executives', 'Capital Group', 'Oakhill Advisors', 'George Linatsas', 'Axia Ventures', 'Dimitris Politis', 'artificial intelligence', 'data centers', 'pharmaceutical executives', 'closed circle', 'Albert Bourla', 'Maximos Mansion', 'Gianluca Pettiti', 'reference country', 'good name', 'human capital', 'U.S.', 'new ambassador', 'Ms. Gilfoyle', 'diplomatic adviser', 'Middle East', 'Fred Kempe', 'Theodoros Kyriakou', 'Antenna Group', 'highest praise', 'Nikos Karachalios', 'Giannis Loulis', 'dream team', 'sentimental bypass', 'hunger strike', 'vice president', 'traditional infrastructure', 'AI-linked infrastructure', 'Aman Hotel', 'new players', 'Marc Casper', 'Gulf countries', 'roundtable discussion', 'Karamanlis’ office', 'first meeting', 'Newsroom', 'everything', 'politician', 'cancellation', 'Erdogan', 'issues', 'Meloni', 'everyone', 'course', 'planetarch', 'difference', 'POTUS', 'leader', 'region', 'case', 'Kathimerini', 'things', 'alternative', 'PASOK', 'guy', 'tomorrow', 'tanks', 'chaos', 'truth', 'end', 'elections', '25 representatives', 'funds', 'banks', 'names', 'value', 'assets', 'total', 'organizations', 'government', 'example', 'Paulson', 'Co.', 'Lazard', 'gathering', 'collaboration', 'HRADF', 'Topics', 'interest', 'technology', '10–12 CEOs', 'Pfizer', 'offices', 'introductions', 'Greece', 'quality', 'mid-October', 'UAE', 'others', 'ball', 'brat', 'No.', 'source', 'Rafina', 'coffee', 'rant', 'something', 'Karystianou', 'gang', 'hatred', 'surname', 'enemies', 'parties', 'Samaras', 'Tsipras', 'Kiki', 'Coco', 'Developments', 'Routsis']",2025-09-26,2025-09-27,en.protothema.gr
