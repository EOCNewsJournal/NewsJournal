Please join us and participate via our donation page  which shows how to give via check  credit card  debit card  PayPal. Clover  or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser  what we’ve accomplished in the last year  and our current goal  supporting the comments section.here. As many of you may know  I find the shift of commentary from articles  blogs  and social media to YouTube and podcasts to be frustrating  since it’s extremely difficult to find exactly what one might have heard again  meaning both the original source (program  speaker  date) and what exactly they said compared to written sources. However  we are republishing an important YouTube discussion between Glenn Diesen and German journalist/best selling author Patrick Baab. Baab lays out a persuasive case as to how many critically-placed European decision-makers are driving towards a full-scale war with Russia  and due to deep personal investment and bad career incentives  will only press more aggressively forward as Russia progresses towards whatever flavor of Ukraine conquest it decides to implement.Yours truly has warned from the outset that Russia could win the war but lose the peace. We had also consistently pointed out that there would be no negotiated end to the war  since there was no bargaining overlap between the Russian and Ukraine/Western positions. We held to that view during the Trump attempts to come to an agreement with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and NATO by pointing out that Ukraine and the Europeans had agency. One must add that domestic and military-industrial complex support of the conflict was sufficiently high that Trump could not pull the lever that might have brought Ukraine  and reluctantly  the Europeans to heel  which would be to end all intel support  including  critically  satellite information and US assistance in targeting  which is required for many US and NATO weapons platforms (aside from setting off a political firestorm  Trump could also have run into non-compliance  recall the military defying his orders in Trump 1.0 to exit Afghanistan).We had assumed that “losing the peace” might amount to a sustained effort at terrorism  both in Russia and parts of Ukraine that Russia occupied (and presumably incorporated into Russia  but Russia may attempt to set up a neutral state of some sort in Western Ukraine that gets more sovereignity over time; the treatment of Germany after World War II is a precedent). John Mearsheimer  however  has been pointing out for a while that even after the Ukraine war was resolved  that the West had plenty of flash points where it could stir up low-level conflicts  with the intent of imposing continuing costs on Russia  such as Kaliningrad and Transnistria.But what Baab describes below is more dire  and also more consistent with the current direction of travel  which is a hot war with Russia. Consistent with his analysis  just now  the Guardian posted a new piece  Britain may already be at war with Russia  former head of MI5 says  which contends that it is Russia that is “at war” with the UK due to alleged hostile acts perpetrated by Russia  such as cyberattacks.However  Baab does not fully connect the dots he sets forth below  perhaps because he’s not yet ready to make what might be depicted as a hyperbolic call (you will see that Baab is exceedingly measured). If one does  the risk of a hot war looks far more imminent  in no small measure due to what both Russian and some US officials have called the Estoniazation of Germany (as to some degree the rest of Europe  which is the batshit hysteric belief that Russia fully intends to go beyond Ukraine and take more European territory.Baab stresses the dire budget condition of Europe and even Germany due to how it handled its post-financial crisis bank rescues  and that the result is governments are even more hostage to financiers than before. He points out how Europe and the moneymen need more “collateral” and point to the mineral and agricultural wealth of Ukraine as a potential source now no longer available to them. He also points out that Germany is making what looks like unaffordable commitments to funding Ukraine and to a military buildup.What he largely skips over is the frozen Russian assets  of which over $200 billion are in Euros and hence in Euroclear. Even though many EU leaders have been scheming to get their hands on them  their latest too-clever idea would require them to be confiscated via a transfer out of Euroclear. Euroclear is in Belgium and Belgium has been howling no way  no how  that this would be the end of anyone trusting European financial institutions as a place to keep deposits and investments.Now what would provide for a legal justification for an asset grab that even Euroclear might not be able to stare down? A bona fide hot war with Russia. There is ample precedent for seizing the extraterritorial assets of belligerent states and their nationals.And Baab gives an obvious trigger below: the West closing Baltic airspace to Russia. We had warned in the runup to the 2016 election that Hillary Clinton’s promise to declare a no-fly zone in Syria amounted to a commitment to initiate a hot war with Russia  since Russia would not accept that restriction. If you think Russia would sit pat with EU states trying to prevent its use of Baltic airspace  I have a bridge I’d like to sell you.Baab does stress that the German military is highly cognizant of the fact that is it in no position to take on Russia  and pols similarly accept that it would take years of rearmament  recruiting/conscription  and training. However  the level of official and press screeching over alleged Russia drone and aircraft trespasses into NATO members’ airspaces  none of which hold up well to scrutiny  intended to rope the US back into recommitting to Project Ukraine  are in danger of assuming a life of their own. Things are so out of control that three officials from NATO states  the UK  France  and Germany  went to Moscow to threaten that they might shoot down Russian jets that encroached on member state airspace and was backed by Trump  leading to a tart Russian response. From Anadolu Agency:Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that statements by Western leaders about shooting down Russian aircraft are “reckless” and could have “dangerous consequences.” “Statements about shooting down Russian planes are  at the very least  reckless  irresponsible  and  of course  dangerous in their consequences ” Peskov told a journalist in Moscow. The remarks came after US President Donald Trump suggested NATO should shoot down Russian jets if they entered the airspace of alliance members during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York. Russian Ambassador to France Alexei Meshkov earlier warned that such a move by NATO would “mean war.” He had claimed Western countries have not provided “tangible proof” of Russia’s involvement in alleged airspace violations. “You know  there are many NATO aircraft that violate Russian airspace … it happens quite often … (but) they are not shot down ” Meshkov said  stressing that Moscow “categorically denies” the accusations.So this version of “Play stupid games  win stupid prizes” is risking nuclear war. Every scenario of a hot war between the US and Russia ends that way.We have extracted key quotes from Raab and put them beneath the video. I hope you can listen to it in full.By Glenn Diesen.

Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up  you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .Jefferies said LINK LINK $ 21.65  Chainlink’s native token  will benefit as tokenization accelerates.As of September  Chainlink secured $103 billion in assets through its oracle feeds  up from $23 billion in early 2024  supporting over 2 500 projects. Partnerships with institutions such as Swift  DTCC  Euroclear and JPMorgan (JPM) underscore its role in bridging crypto and TradFi  wrote analysts Andrew Moss and Matthew Molta.Tokenization  converting real-world assets into programmable digital tokens  is driving demand for infrastructure that can securely link on-chain and off-chain environments. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) address this challenge  supporting real-time settlement and automation across finance  insurance  and supply chains  the analysts wrote.Jefferies said digital asset adoption remains early  but tokenization pilots are moving quickly toward production. With LINK used to pay for services  node operations and staking  growing demand for Chainlink’s infrastructure could provide token holders a call on future cash flows.While rivals like LayerZero and Pyth exist  Chainlink’s network effects and first-mover advantage may give it a durable moat in blockchain infrastructure  the bank said.The analysts estimated that tokenized asset value has reached $30 billion excluding stablecoins  a 253% increase year to date.As tokenization reduces operational costs and increases liquidity  Jefferies said it expects institutional investors to migrate toward blockchain-based settlement layers  placing Chainlink at the center of the transition.Read more: Polymarket Connects to Chainlink to Cut Tampering Risks in Price Bets,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,negative,0.18,0.33,0.49,True,English,"['Power TradFi Shift', 'Chainlink', 'Blockchain', 'Jefferies', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'programmable digital tokens', 'digital asset adoption', 'future cash flows', 'tokenized asset value', 'tokenized asset settlement', 'Decentralized Oracle Networks', 'blockchain-based settlement layers', 'Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'advanced use cases', 'investment bank Jefferies', 'oracle feeds', 'real-time settlement', 'cross-chain messaging', 'network effects', 'foundational layer', 'capital markets', 'Sergey Nazarov', 'smart contracts', 'real-world data', 'CoinDesk products', 'privacy policy', 'native token', 'Andrew Moss', 'Matthew Molta', 'supply chains', 'node operations', 'token holders', 'first-mover advantage', 'durable moat', 'operational costs', 'institutional investors', 'Tampering Risks', 'Price Bets', 'chain systems', 'chain environments', 'traditional finance', 'blockchain infrastructure', 'parametric insurance', 'real-world assets', 'growing demand', 'LINK LINK', 'tokenization pilots', 'Chainlink', 'report', 'call', 'founder', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'September', 'early', '2,500 projects', 'Partnerships', 'institutions', 'Swift', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'JPMorgan', 'role', 'TradFi', 'analysts', 'CCIP', 'DONs', 'challenge', 'automation', 'production', 'services', 'rivals', 'LayerZero', 'Pyth', 'stablecoins', '253% increase', 'date', 'liquidity', 'center', 'transition', 'Polymarket']",2025-09-29,2025-09-30,coindesk.com

The collaboration uses AI  Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure  and blockchain to automate data processing and establish a shared “golden record.”The project targets one of the most costly inefficiencies in global finance. Corporate actions consume an estimated $58 billion annually  with expenses rising 10% each year. Automation remains below 40%  leaving institutions reliant on manual work.With participation growing to 24 institutions  including DTCC  UBS  and DBS Bank  the solution uses Chainlink’s oracle platform  blockchain  and artificial intelligence to transform fragmented disclosures into standardized  real-time data accessible across multiple languages.In addition to successfully handling multilingual disclosures  like those in Spanish and Chinese  the system achieved nearly full consensus among AI models on tested corporate actions  as noted by Chainlink.Instead of days  validated data was delivered directly into existing financial systems within minutes  according to the team. The architecture also demonstrated support for tokenized equities through unified records accessible across both blockchains and traditional infrastructure.“By leveraging DLT  we can bring increased levels of transparency  connectivity  and accuracy to the ecosystem ” said Dan Doney  Managing Director & Chief Technology Officer  DTCC Digital Assets. “We welcomed the opportunity to bring this use case to life and demonstrate how innovative technology can transform processes and deliver new capabilities and value to the industry.”The next phase will broaden the workflow to include corporate actions beyond dividends and mergers  such as stock splits  while also extending global reach with support for more jurisdictions and currencies.The team also plans to introduce stronger privacy and governance controls to strengthen compliance for financial institutions worldwide.“Delivering scalable digital market infrastructure means aligning new solutions with the systems institutions already trust.

This procedure is a continuation of the pre-pack sale process initiated on 03 June 20251. The objective of this procedure is to evaluate and implement solutions that would make it possible to continue the activity and maintain jobs  notably through a sale plan.To date  four offers to take over part of the assets are still open and have been submitted to the court. These offers may be subject to change and contain conditions precedent that will have to be lifted before the review hearing of said offers. To date  no proposals to take over the shares or to invest in the capital have been submitted.In the event of the takeover of certain assets or activities by one or more buyers  or in the absence of a final offer  judicial liquidation proceedings for Global Bioenergies will be opened simultaneously with the judgment of the court resulting from the review hearing.The judicial liquidation of Global Bioenergies will ultimately result in the delisting of its shares. Their residual value will most likely be zero  as the amount obtained in exchange for the assets sold is expected to be lower than the amount of liabilities.The hearing to review the takeover offers should be held on 03 November 2025.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESAs a committed player in the fight against global warming  Global Bioenergies has developed a unique process to produce SAF and e-SAF from renewable resources  thereby meeting the challenges of decarbonising air transport.

The decrease is mainly due to a more selective R&D tax credit eligibility for the R&D costs  the clinical development progressing  and to a lesser extent the first effects of the pipeline prioritization plan initiated in the first half of 2025.R&D expenses for the first half of 2025 amounted to €44.9 million  mainly driven by the development of lanifibranor in MASH  and were down 4% compared to the €46.8 million for the first half of 2024. The evolution of the lanifibranor development costs was in line with expectations  while expenses related to the discontinued preclinical programs started to decrease compared to the same period in 2024.Marketing and business development expenses stood at €0.7 million for the first half of 2025 compared to €0.6 million for the same period in 2024.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to €14.7 million in the first half of 2025  compared to €7.7 million in the first half of 2024  mainly due to the increase of personnel costs of €5.7 million related to share-based compensation plans non-cash expenses for €4.7 million.Net financial income (loss) amounted to (€113.2) million in the first half of 2025  compared to €3.5 million for the same period in 2024. The net financial loss in the first half of 2025 is mainly due to (i) non-cash IFRS treatment of the accounting at the fair value  including (€84.7) million related to derivative instruments in connection with the second tranche of the Structured Financing and (€17.9) million from warrants previously issued to the EIB  and ii) (€9.7) million  mainly non-cash  in loans and royalty certificates interests expenses.The Company’s net loss stood at (€175.9) million as of June 30  2025  compared to (€49.0) million as of June 30  2024.As of June 30  2025  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to €122.1 million and €24.6 million of short-term deposits4  compared to cash and cash equivalents at €96.6 million and no short-term deposits as of December 31  2024.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to (€53.7) million in the first half of 2025  compared to (€48.3) million for the same period in 2024  while the R&D expenses for the first half of 2025 were slightly lower at (€44.9) million  compared to the first half of 2024. The increase in net cash used in operating activities is mainly due to working capital evolution and the net cash impact of the Company’s pipeline prioritization plan during the first half of 2025.Net cash used in investing activities for the first half of 2025 amounted to (€24.8) million  compared to €8.9 million generated in the first half of 2024. The change is mostly due to the new subscription of deposits during the period.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first half of 2025 amounted to €104.8 million  compared to €22.6 million in the first half of 2024. The net cash generated from financing activities primarily comes from the receipt of the gross proceeds of €115.6 million (net proceeds of €108.0 million) from the settlement in May 2025 of the second tranche5 of the Structured Financing.Over the first half of 2025  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.7) million  compared to a positive effect of €0.1 million for the first half of 2024  due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits  combined with the $10 million (gross proceeds) milestone payment received from CTTQ on July 7  2025  and the anticipated completion of the Company’s pipeline prioritization plan  should allow it to fund its operations as currently planned until the end of the third quarter of 20266.The Company will need to raise additional funds to achieve its long-term objectives for the development and potential commercialization of lanifibranor through other potential public offerings or private placements and potential strategic options such as business development partnerships  merger and acquisition transactions and/or licensing agreements.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolio and corporate updateMs. Lucy Lu resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company  effective May 21  2025.

This reflects the successful integration of acquisitions completed over the past 12 months  the increasing international reach of its offerings  the rollout of technological and data-driven marketing solutions  and the Group's leadership in artificial intelligence applied to marketing.The portfolio businesses continued their commercial investments to consolidate their recurring subscription revenues. In a sharply declining press market  the Magazines business limited its contraction to -6.9% by targeting its marketing campaigns at the most profitable customer segments and developing new offerings and partnerships. The Insurance business delivered nearly stable sales thanks to AI-enhanced campaigns  particularly in health  which supported policyholder loyalty.FIRST-HALF EARNINGSConsolidated net sales2 came to €117.4m  up +12.3%  while the net revenue3 rose +5.8% to €88.3m.Against a backdrop of sustained investments and expenses related to the organizational adaptation of certain Group's entities  restated EBITDA totaled €10.6m. While this was down -14.1% versus the first half of 2024 and -4.8% versus the second half of 2024  it still represented 12.0% of net revenue for the period. Excluding these adaptation costs  restated EBITDA would have been nearly stable compared with the prior year (€12.4m).Income from ordinary operations came to €6.5m  representing 7.4% of the half-year net revenue compared with 10.1% for the first half of 2024. This change reflects:The Magazines business maintaining its profitability rate  but with a lower contribution due to reduced sales.A decline in Consulting profitability  impacted by the economic slowdown  structuring costs  and international investments.Solid growth in Agency & Solutions earnings  driven by the development of technological offerings  which helped mitigate the effects of adverse market conditions.EBIT totaled €6.4m  down -15.4% compared with the first half of 2024 and -0.4% compared with the second half of 2024. This result includes -€0.1m of non-current expenses linked to the partial write-down of goodwill for the subsidiary ADLP Assurances (versus -€0.8m for the first half of 2024 related to the partial write-down of goodwill for the former subsidiary Groupe Grand Mercredi).After a tax charge of €2.8 million  consolidated net income amounted to €3.7m  representing a net margin of 4.2% of net revenue (versus 6.5% for the first half of 2024).After deducting minority interests  net income (Group share) totaled €3.8m  compared with €5.5m for the first half of 2024.(€m) First half of 2025 First half of 2024 Change Net sales 117.4 104.6 +12.3% Net revenue 88.3 83.5 +5.8% Restated EBITDA 10.6 12.4 -14.1% % of net revenue 12.0% 14.8% -280 bp Income from ordinary operations 6.5 8.4 -22.4% % of net revenue 7.4% 10.1% -270 bp EBIT 6.4 7.6 -15.4% % of net revenue 7.3% 9.1% -184 bp Net financial expenses / income (0.0) 0.4 Tax expense (2.8) (2.6) Share of net income from associates 0.0 0.0 Consolidated net income 3.7 5.4 -32.1% % of net revenue 4.2% 6.5% -233 bp Net income (Group share) 3.8 5.5 -31.0% % of net revenue 4.3% 6.6% -231 bpFINANCIAL POSITION AT 30 JUNE 2025The Group’s shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2025 stood at €57.5m  up +€2.7m from €54.8m at 31 December 2024  primarily reflecting half-year earnings (+€3.7m)  the ordinary dividend paid out in June (-€3.0m)  the impact of treasury shares and bonus share awards (-€2.6m)  and the change in goodwill (+€4.7m).The Group had €45.8m of cash at 30 June 2025  compared with €58.0m at 31 December 2024 and €58.9m at 30 June 2024. Financial debt totaled €53.6m  slightly down from end-2024 (€55.0m)  including commitments to buy out minority interests in the Group’s subsidiaries (€35.3m)  as well as €18.3m of bank borrowings arranged in 2022 at favorable interest rates to support the Group’s development.Cash net of financial liabilities4 at 30 June 2025 came to €(7.8)m  compared with €3.0m at end-2024 and €15.1m at 30 June 2024  reflecting the pace of sustained investment over the past 12 months.OUTLOOKIn an uncertain economic environment  DÉKUPLE approaches the remainder of the financial year with confidence  supported by a strategy of profitable and selective growth.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.3 For the digital marketing business  the net revenue (formerly gross margin) represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers.

Series B investors include IAGi Ventures (the dedicated corpor…,"Backed by global leaders in aviation  energy  and climate investing  OXCCU strengthens its position as a critical player in the global push for commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Series B investors include IAGi Ventures (the dedicated corporate venturing arm of the International Airlines Group)  Safran Corporate Ventures  and Orlen VC alongside re-investment from world-class Series A participants.OXFORD  England  Sept. 29  2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OXCCU  the Oxford University spin-out developing a one-step process to convert waste carbon into SAF  has raised £20.75 million ($28 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. The round includes new investors Orlen VC  Safran Corporate Ventures  International Airlines Group (IAG)  Hostplus  and TCVC  alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures  IP Group/Kiko Ventures  Aramco Ventures  Eni Next  Braavos Capital  and the University of Oxford.This new capital will enable OXCCU to accelerate its commercialisation efforts  expand its operations  and advance its next phase of technology scale-up. It builds on the launch of the company's OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024 . Their second demonstration plant  OX2  is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However  despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU  high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.""In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective  this raise is a testament to the strength of our science  the clarity of our mission  and the urgency of the problem we're solving "" said Andrew Symes  CEO of OXCCU. ""What we're seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.""The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU's process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead  its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs  and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.The catalyst's ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas  gasified wood waste  and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.Jonathon Counsell  Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG)  said:""We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector  being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.""Ireneusz Fąfara  President of the Management Board of ORLEN  said:""We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year  we introduced SAF—sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials—into our offering. In line with our strategy  by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU  a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.""Nathalie Stubler  Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: ""At Safran  we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment  we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.""Daniel Goldman  Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures  said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years  the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility  proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market  unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors  we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""Dr Robert Trezona  Partner  Cleantech at IP Group  said: ""This round is a significant milestone  not just for the Company  but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK's ability to lead in climate innovation  turning world-class science into global solutions  while generating jobs and lasting impact. We're proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.""OXCCU's solution meets both environmental and commercial demands  with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.""This is a critical time for climate tech  as the urgency continues to increase "" added Symes. ""Aviation needs a solution  and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.""About OXCCU TECH LTDOXCCU  a spin-out company from the University of Oxford  is developing novel catalysts and reactor designs to convert waste carbon into liquid hydrocarbons with high conversion and selectivity for use as fuels and chemicals.
