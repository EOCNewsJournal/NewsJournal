Seen by RFE/RL  the paper was briefly discussed by the bloc's ambassadors on September 26.Von der Leyen is due to present this paper to EU leaders as they meet for an informal summit in Copenhagen on October 1 to discuss Ukraine with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy likely to be in attendance. The bloc's finance ministers are also expected to go over more details when they assemble in Luxembourg next week.While not all the loan mechanisms have been hashed out yet  a few of the outlines are clear.Any loan to Ukraine would be based on frozen Russian assets in the EU that have been immobilized since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago. The loan would be provided without actually touching the cash itself  and Ukraine would have to return the money only after Russia pays for war damages.The reparations loan  if approved  could solve a number of issues.Most importantly  it would give Ukraine the cash injection it needs while eliminating any potential vetoes by recalcitrant EU member states  such as Hungary and Slovakia.It would also settle the question of what to do with Russian assets in the bloc and relieve pressure on the EU budget.Possible ObstaclesBut it is far from a done deal  and there are still a few hurdles to clear.Let's start with the frozen Russian assets.It is believed that there are about 176 billion euros ($207 billion) of these holdings in the bloc  mainly in Euroclear  a Belgian-based financial markets company specializing in central securities depositories.Some countries  notably the Baltic states  have long wanted to confiscate this money and either give it to Ukraine or use it to build up Europe's underfunded defenses. The argument is simple: Why should European taxpayers foot the bill for the Kremlin's war?But many western European nations are against straight-up confiscation.Belgium is fretting that Moscow would file a solid legal claim against the country and Euroclear for these assets.The European Central Bank (ECB) is concerned about what confiscation would do to the status of the euro  currently the world's second reserve currency  as such a move might prompt third countries to save elsewhere.Bigger European countries also believe that the money should remain immobilized and instead be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine in the likely scenario that Moscow refuses to pay reparations when the war ends.The fact also remains that the frozen assets are already being used to generate funds for Ukraine. These are the quarterly windfall profits derived from the cash -- often some 1.5 billion euros ($1.75 billion) that are immediately transferred to the war-torn country.Coalition Of The Willing?The European Commission is now suggesting the following: Some or all of the frozen assets in Euroclear should be transferred to a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in exchange for zero-coupon bonds issued by the European Commission. These would be backed by guarantees from a ""coalition of the willing"" consisting of EU member states and possibly other countries from the Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies.The money in the SPV would then be transferred to Kyiv as loans throughout 2026 and 2027 (and possibly even beyond that)  and Ukraine would only have to pay the money back once Russia pays war reparations.How much money would be available depends on an assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  but it could be 140 billion euros ($164 billion) for those two years. It's likely that most of this would need to be provided by Europe if the United States refuses to commit any funds to the scheme.The good thing about this move would be that it circumvents potential national vetoes.This was a dilemma in early 2024 when the EU agreed on its 50-billion-euro ($59 billion) ""Ukraine facility"" for the years 2024-2027 and Hungary initially blocked the move.This cash was taken from the common EU budget ""headroom"" -- essentially the spare capacity in the budget beyond what has already been committed -- but all 27 member states had to give it the green light.Some 32 billion euros ($37 billion) out of the 50 billion have already been provided to Kyiv  so there isn't that much headroom left  and Budapest would likely object to more cash being used for this purpose.And while the European Commission is proposing a 100-billion-euro ($118 billion) fund for Ukraine in the multiannual EU budget for 2028-2034  all the member states must sign off on this as well  while it is also increasingly clear that Kyiv needs more immediate funding.But this is far from a done deal  and Hungary can still put up obstacles to some extent.The frozen Russian assets will only remain immobilized as long as the EU decides they should stay that way. And Brussels does that twice a year  in July and January  via unanimity. No country  including Hungary  made much of a fuss regarding the latest extension two months ago  but that doesn't rule out any issues arising in the future.National Guarantees?The European Commission suggests in the discussion paper that a decision to prolong the sanctions in the future should be taken by a qualified majority  but it notes that this ""would require a high-level political agreement by all or most Heads of State or Government.""It is very doubtful that leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Slovakia's Robert Fico would simply give this a thumbs-up.There may also be an issue with national guarantees.How many countries would really be willing to enter a ""coalition of the willing"" on this?The more countries that do so  the less money each country would have to guarantee. But in many member states  the national parliament would need to sign off on such a thing and with several countries grappling with ballooning deficits  a lot of politicians may be wary of committing to any type of guarantees.Euroclear is also likely to push for full and solid guarantees and potentially even a say in the governance of the new loan structure.And it cannot be ruled out that Euroclear may insist that other financial institutions holding frozen Russian assets also be made to contribute to this scheme.Source: https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-reparations- loan-ukraine-frozen-russian-assets/33544244.htmlCopyright (c) 2025.

Ad DisclosureChainlink (LINK) has unveiled a new initiative aimed at transforming the corporate actions processing system  collaborating with 24 of the world’s largest organizations of the broader financial sector.This partnership  announced on Monday  seeks to leverage Chainlink’s oracle technology  blockchain capabilities  and artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the often cumbersome and costly processes associated with corporate actions.Chainlink Partners With Financial Giants To Save BillionsAccording to the press release  the Chainlink-powered solution will allow financial institutions to receive structured and validated corporate actions data in multiple languages directly into their systems within minutes  rather than the days currently required.This is expected to save the global financial industry billions of dollars annually by minimizing processing disruptions  reducing settlement errors  expediting reconciliations  and lowering operational risks faced by financial institutions.Among the key participants in this initiative are major financial market infrastructures such as SWIFT  The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  Euroclear  and SIX  alongside asset managers and banks like UBS  DBS Bank  and BNP Paribas.Corporate actions processing currently costs the financial industry an estimated $58 billion each year  with costs increasing by 10% annually and automation rates lagging below 40%.A recent report by Citi highlighted that the average corporate action event involves over 110 000 firm interactions and costs approximately $34 million to process  with a significant portion of market participants still relying on manual data validation.Future PlansIn the first phase of the initiative  Chainlink  SWIFT  Euroclear  and several financial institutions showcased how large language models (LLMs) — including OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini — could effectively extract structured data from unstructured corporate action announcements.The second phase introduced a new deployment  enhancing the speed and accessibility of corporate actions data. Through the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)  multiple AI model outputs were validated and transformed into ISO 20022-compliant messages  which were then disseminated via the SWIFT Network.Additionally  the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled the distribution of these records across both DTCC’s blockchain ecosystem and various public and private blockchain platforms.This initiative not only achieved nearly 100% data consensus among the AI models assessed but also demonstrated multilingual processing capabilities  accommodating disclosures in languages such as Spanish and Chinese.Looking ahead  the team plans to expand this workflow to accommodate more complex corporate actions  such as stock splits  while increasing global coverage through additional jurisdictions and currencies.Enhanced privacy and governance controls will also be introduced to meet the operational and compliance needs of financial institutions worldwide. Sergey Nazarov  Co-Founder of Chainlink  stated:Addressing the data validation challenges of corporate actions through AI Oracle Networks represents a significant advancement  demonstrating that multiple AIs can achieve consensus on critical information within a Decentralized Oracle Network.Featured image from DALL-E  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,True,English,"['$50 Billion Corporate Challenges', 'Latest Plan', 'TradFi Giants', 'Chainlink', 'average corporate action event', 'unstructured corporate action announcements', 'Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'major financial market infrastructures', 'multiple AI model outputs', 'corporate actions processing system', 'The Depository Trust', 'ISO 20022-compliant messages', 'complex corporate actions', 'leading industry experts', 'broader financial sector', 'manual data validation', 'large language models', 'multilingual processing capabilities', 'data validation challenges', 'corporate actions data', 'private blockchain platforms', 'AI Oracle Networks', 'Decentralized Oracle Network', 'Trusted Editorial content', 'Chainlink Runtime Environment', 'global financial industry', 'several financial institutions', 'processing disruptions', 'market participants', 'AI models', 'blockchain capabilities', 'oracle technology', 'multiple AIs', 'Financial Giants', 'global coverage', 'blockchain ecosystem', 'multiple languages', 'seasoned editors', 'Ad Disclosure', 'largest organizations', 'artificial intelligence', 'costly processes', 'press release', 'Chainlink-powered solution', 'settlement errors', 'key participants', 'Clearing Corporation', 'asset managers', 'DBS Bank', 'BNP Paribas', 'automation rates', 'recent report', '110,000 firm interactions', 'significant portion', 'Future Plans', 'first phase', 'second phase', 'new deployment', 'various public', '100% data consensus', 'stock splits', 'additional jurisdictions', 'Enhanced privacy', 'governance controls', 'compliance needs', 'Sergey Nazarov', 'significant advancement', 'critical information', 'Featured image', 'Chainlink Partners', 'SWIFT Network', 'operational risks', 'new initiative', 'world', 'partnership', 'Monday', 'cumbersome', 'Billions', 'systems', 'minutes', 'days', 'dollars', 'reconciliations', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'SIX', 'banks', 'UBS', 'costs', 'Citi', 'LLMs', 'OpenAI', 'GPT', 'Google', 'Gemini', 'speed', 'accessibility', 'CRE', 'CCIP', 'distribution', 'records', 'disclosures', 'Spanish', 'Chinese', 'team', 'workflow', 'currencies', 'Founder', 'DALL-E', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2025-09-30,2025-10-01,bitcoinist.com

It then triggered the subscriptions or redemptions in the Chainlink Digital Transfer Agent  according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.The setup lets banks access blockchain infrastructure using tools they already use  like Swift  while Chainlink’s infrastructure handles the rest.The pilot builds on previous work from Project Guardian  a tokenization initiative led by Singapore’s central bank. The latest development adds in interoperability that enables institutions to use Swift to trigger on-chain events.The launch comes after Chainlink announced a separate pilot with 24 global banks and financial infrastructure providers like DTCC and Euroclear. That project used Chainlink’s tools and AI to extract and standardize data from corporate action announcements  a process that currently costs the industry an estimated $58 billion annually.Read more: SWIFT to Develop Blockchain-Based Ledger for 24/7 Cross-Border Payments,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.18,0.39,0.44,True,English,"['UBS Advance $100T Fund Industry Tokenization', 'Swift Workflow', 'Chainlink', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'Chainlink Digital Transfer Agent', 'corporate action announcements', '24/7 Cross-Border Payments', 'tokenized investment funds', 'interbank messaging system', 'financial infrastructure providers', 'financial messaging', 'tokenized fund', 'traditional finance', 'Runtime Environment', 'ISO 20022 messages', 'international standard', 'privacy policy', 'blockchain workflows', 'existing systems', 'press release', 'blockchain infrastructure', 'previous work', 'tokenization initiative', 'central bank', 'latest development', 'chain events', 'Blockchain-Based Ledger', 'technical process', 'CoinDesk products', 'Project Guardian', 'separate pilot', '24 global banks', 'Swift messages', 'UBS', 'CRE', 'redemptions', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'use', 'setup', 'tools', 'rest', 'Singapore', 'interoperability', 'institutions', 'launch', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'data', 'industry']",2025-09-30,2025-10-01,coindesk.com

Sept. 30  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO - NASDAQ: NBTX - the “Company”)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering nanotherapeutic approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  provided an update on operational progress and announced its half year financial results for the six-month period ended June 30  2025.Operational Highlights of the 2025 Half Year Period and To DateExpanding clinical development program evaluating the potential broad applicability of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) continues to build significant momentum:First patient dosed in the CONVERGE study  a Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”)-sponsored randomized Phase 2 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with Stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care chemoradiation followed by consolidation durvalumabFirst data announced from the completed dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) as a 2L+ therapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC  sponsored by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CenterAnnounced full data from the completed MD Anderson Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in pancreatic cancer along with the launch of a new cohort and expansion of the trialAchieved regulatory harmonization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) after agreement with health authorities in major European countries to reclassify JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) from a medical device to a drugFiled a new composition of matter patent for JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) that aims to reinforce the intellectual property foundation supporting the product candidateFirst data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1Updated data announced from a Nanobiotix-sponsored Phase 1 study continuing to support JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) plus anti-PD-1 as a potential new 1L or 2L+ option in anti-PD-1 naïve or resistant R/M-HNSCCFurther execution of disciplined financial plan to reinforce pathway to long-term  self-sustained growth:Strengthened financial position through amendment of the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) global licensing agreement extending cash visibility to mid-2026In active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing  intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond mid-2026.Half Year 2025 Financial ResultsRevenue and Other Income: Revenue and other income have increased for the six months ended June 30  2025  up to €26.6 million  compared to €9.3 million for the same period in 2024. Further to J&J amendment letter signed in March 2025 reducing the Company’s funding obligation on the future NANORAY-312 study costs  a positive non-cash revenue impact amounting to €21.2m was recorded in accordance with IFRS15 revenue recognition accounting principles application  offsetting the negative non-cash revenue impact recognized in 2024 results following the transfer of NANORAY-312 study sponsorship to J&J signed at the end of 2024. In addition  revenue towards J&J also included €3.4m of clinical product sales to J&J and R&D tax credit income of 1.7 million.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical and manufacturing expenses including employee-related payroll expenses related to the development of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3). These expenses for the six months ending June 30 2025  were €14.5 million compared to €22.0 million for the same period in 2024. This favorable R&D cost decrease was primarily driven by lower clinical development activities in NANORAY-312 study further to the transfer of sponsorship to J&J which has assumed nearly all remaining study expanses  less a small portion of costs that remain covered by the Company.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related payroll expenses  legal and other professional fees  patent filing and maintenance fees  and insurance. Total SG&A expenses for the six months ending June 30  2025  were €11.3 million  which is quite stable compared to €10.8 million for the same period in 2024. This slight unfavorable variance is mainly due to a phasing issue of social contributions expenses.Net loss: Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the six months ending June 30  2025  was €5.4 million  or a €0.11 basic loss per share. This compares to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of €21.9 million  or €0.46 basic loss per share  for the same period in 2024.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2025  were €28.8 million  compared to €49.7 million as of December 31  2024.Financial Guidance: Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  the Company anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €28.8 million as of June 30  2025  will fund its operations into mid-2026  similar to its prior guidance.Going Concern:In March 2025  the Company and J&J executed an amendment to the License Agreement. The amendment provides that J&J will assume nearly all remaining costs for the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial through completion  less a small portion of costs that will remain covered by the Company  allowing the Company to extend its cash runway and to reduce its operating cash outflows post this amendment  including the period beyond mid-2026.With the available €28.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2025 and based on its current operating plan  the Company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be insufficient to fund its operations over the next twelve months following the issuance of interim condensed consolidated financial statements.These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.However  as the Company is in active discussions regarding non-dilutive financing intended to meaningfully extend its cash runway beyond the 12 months  the executive board determined it is appropriate to prepare the interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30  2025  on a going concern basis  assuming the Company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future and to address its liquidity challenges by pursuing activities to generate additional cash inflows and by closely managing its operating expenditures  based on assumptions described in the half-year 2025 financial report.Availability of the Half Year 2025 Financial ReportsThe 2025 half-year financial report has been filed with the French financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers).

Th…,Long-lasting antibody persistence was comparable in older (65+) and younger adultsLong-term antibody persistence is a key competitive advantage for a vaccine targeting unpredictable outbreak diseases like chikungunyaSaint-Herblain (France)  September 30  2025 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive antibody persistence data four years after vaccination with a single dose of its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ®. The results are in line with Valneva’s expectations for this vaccine  confirming a strong and long-lasting antibody persistence across all age groups investigated. The four-year persistence data are in line with previous persistence data1  2 3  further highlighting a key advantage of the vaccine.Among the 254 healthy adults still followed in the trial  95% maintained neutralizing antibody titers well above the seroresponse threshold4 four years after the single-dose vaccination. Persistence of antibodies in older adults (age 65+) was comparable to younger adults (18-64 years of age) in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroresponse rates (SRRs).Trial VLA1553-303  which has received funding support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the European Union’s (EU) Horizon Europe program  also collected long-term safety data up to two years  including Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding trial and any new-onset Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). No safety concerns were reported or identified and no AESI were ongoing at the time of participant enrollment in the trial. Per trial protocol  antibody persistence is planned to be collected up to ten years after vaccination.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are very encouraged by these four-year data  which further reinforce IXCHIQ®'s unique profile and its ability to generate a robust  durable antibody response in both younger and older adults with just a single dose. Whether you are a traveler  live in an endemic area  or face an outbreak situation  the prospect of long-term protection from a mosquito-borne disease with a single vaccination is highly valuable  especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ((LMICs) where vaccine access is often limited.”Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s access. The Company expanded its partnership with CEPI in 20245 to support broader access to the vaccine in LMICs and  within the framework of this agreement  announced an exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII) to enable supply of the vaccine in Asia6.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.7In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.8 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas9 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.10About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The presentation  titled “alfapump®: Totally Implantable Peritoneal Drain Pump with Urinary Bladder Drainage ” focused on the surgical and technical aspects of the alfapump implant procedure for interventional radiologists.Dr. Rahul Patel  Assistant Professor of Radiology and Surgery  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  who presented at the symposium  commented: “The alfapump system represents a significant advancement in the management of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. From an intervention perspective  the implant procedure builds on established interventional radiology techniques while providing patients with a new treatment option. The ability to continuously and automatically remove ascites from the abdomen into the bladder offers our patients freedom from the burden of repeated large volume paracentesis procedures.”Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  continued: “We are delighted to see the alfapump system featured at this important specialty conference for the interventional radiology community. This presentation will raise awareness of the alfapump amongst the interventional radiologist community and is key in ensuring they have the knowledge and confidence to offer this innovative device to their patients. For too long  many patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis have had to put up with a standard of care that has changed little in over 2 000 years. The alfapump is a 21st century solution recognising that cirrhosis is increasingly a mainstream disease and patients are demanding and deserving better treatment options.”The alfapump® system received U.S. FDA Premarket Approval in December 2024 for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first active implantable medical device in the U.S. that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917Media Relations:Jon YuICR HealthcareE: Sequana@icrhealthcare.comT: +1 (646) 677-1855Important Safety Information:Indication for Use: The alfapump® System is intended for single patient use only in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical’s POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1 2.Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through a small specialty salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. CMS has approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.3 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

At present  according to Euronext  the fragmentation of the market has led to much trading of ETFs happening over-the-counter or on alternative trading platforms  reducing transparency and making sales more complex.Euronext operates the stock markets in France  Italy  Netherlands  Norway  Belgium and Portugal as well as Ireland. It says there are currently 3 500 ETF listings in Europe  of which about 2 100 are in Milan  750 in Paris  and 700 in Amsterdam.Some 834 ETFs are cross listed between Amsterdam  Paris and Milan. The new system will mean that ETF listers no longer have to put the same instrument on multiple venues in order to make them available to all retail investors in Europe At present  the average number of listings per ETF in Europe is 3.5 From now on  Euronext says  the listing location will not matter  and all ETF trades will be done on a single platform  with an efficient post-trade process. The complexity of the post-trade arrangements  which vary from market to market  have meant that every-day investors participate less in the European markets than their counterparts in America.There had been speculation that Euronext would instead force the relocation of all ETF listings to one market  such as Amsterdam.“Investors  particularly retail participants  will enjoy more transparent  cost-effective access to a wider array of ETFs from across Europe supported by deeper liquidity  greater price visibility  and a broader selection at more competitive rates ” the stock exchange operator said.“Issuers will also be able to list a broad range of products  covering multiple asset classes and underlying benchmarks  and to offer the same product in different currency denominations  thereby enhancing flexibility and alignment with investor demand across jurisdictions.”Euronext says one ETF listing will reduce costs. Photo: BloombergToday's News in 90 Seconds - September 30thEuronext says that issuers representing over 90pc of European ETF assets and major brokers support its new platform  including BlackRock  BNP Paribas Asset Management  HSBC Asset Management  and VangardSarah Melvin  head of European client business at BlackRock  said: “We have long been supportive of efforts to grow capital markets in Europe as a way to enhance prosperity for Europeans and the competitiveness of the European economy. We believe unifying ETF trading will improve access and transparency for investors  helping bring down barriers to investing and contributing to more vibrant and deeper capital markets in Europe.”Andrea Busi  chief executive at Directa  said the platform was aiming to meet the needs of an ever-growing number of investors. “In the first half of 2025  Directa’s clients made twice the number of transactions on ETF compared to 2024: a clear sign of the level of appeal these financial products have reached among Italian retail investors.""",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,True,English,"['first integrated marketplace', 'European ETFs', 'Euronext', 'first fully integrated marketplace', 'BNP Paribas Asset Management', 'HSBC Asset Management', 'long-standing structural inefficiencies', 'greater price visibility', 'different currency denominations', 'multiple asset classes', 'several European exchanges', 'European client business', 'efficient post-trade process', 'alternative trading platforms', 'transparent, cost-effective access', 'stock exchange operator', 'European ETF assets', 'unifying ETF trading', 'deeper capital markets', 'Irish retail investors', 'Italian retail investors', 'one ETF listing', 'European ETF market', 'first half', 'European markets', 'stock markets', 'European economy', 'stock-exchange operator', 'multiple venues', 'post-trade arrangements', 'retail participants', 'deeper liquidity', 'single listing', 'listing location', 'ETF listers', 'ETF trades', 'one market', 'wider range', 'exchange-traded funds', 'lower cost', 'popular funds', 'same instrument', 'new model', 'settlement system', 'new system', 'wider array', 'broader selection', 'competitive rates', 'broad range', 'underlying benchmarks', 'same product', 'investor demand', 'September 30th', 'major brokers', 'Sarah Melvin', 'Andrea Busi', 'chief executive', 'clear sign', '3,500 ETF listings', 'average number', 'single platform', 'new platform', 'growing number', 'financial products', 'opportunity', 'ETFs', 'Euronext', 'issuers', 'clearing', 'fragmentation', 'counter', 'transparency', 'sales', 'France', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Belgium', 'Portugal', 'Ireland', 'Milan', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'order', 'complexity', 'day', 'America', 'speculation', 'relocation', 'flexibility', 'alignment', 'jurisdictions', 'costs', 'Photo', 'Bloomberg', 'News', '90 Seconds', '90pc', 'BlackRock', 'Vangard', 'head', 'efforts', 'prosperity', 'Europeans', 'competitiveness', 'barriers', 'investing', 'vibrant', 'Directa', 'needs', 'clients', 'transactions', 'level', 'appeal']",2025-09-30,2025-10-01,independent.ie
