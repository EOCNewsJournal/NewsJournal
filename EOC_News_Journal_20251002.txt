Under the plan  Kyiv would not need to repay the loan until Russia covers the costs of war reparations.While some EU states have raised concerns over the legality and risk-sharing aspects of the scheme  support appeared to build on Wednesday at an EU summit in Denmark  Copenhagen. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo  Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal all endorsed using seized Russian funds to support Ukraine.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen  who was hosting the meeting  said that the commission’s plan “is actually quite a good way forward.”She added: “There are some legal questions that have to be asked and I’m confident that we will find a way through this. But the whole idea of using the frozen assets I think is a good idea.”Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and French President Emmanuel Macron indicated they were open to the plan  provided legal and financial risks are addressed. “We need to remain a place that’s attractive and reliable  we Europeans ” said Macron. “That means that when assets are frozen  we respect international law.”AdvertisementEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that despite some divergence  the EU was working quickly to reach an agreement on the loan. “It’s not supported by everybody yet  so there’s still a lot of work to do ” she told reporters on the sidelines of the summit. “But if we don’t take these [Russian] assets into account  then it is on our taxpayers. That’s for sure.”‘Illegal seizure of Russian property’The Kremlin has denounced the proposed Reparations Loan  saying any use of frozen Russian funds for this purpose would be “pure theft”.“We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property. In Russian  we call that simply theft ” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. He warned that anyone who misappropriated Russia’s assets or the income they generate “will be prosecuted in one way or another” and “called to account”.Peskov also claimed such actions would erode confidence in Europe’s financial institutions. “The boomerang will very seriously hit those who are the main depositories  countries that are interested in investment attractiveness ” he said.A World Bank study this year estimated that as of December 2024  Ukraine’s reconstruction would cost $524bn over the next decade – about 2.8 times its gross domestic product for that year.There are about $300bn in frozen Russian assets  including 210 billion euros ($247bn) held in Europe. Of that  185 billion euros ($217bn) is in Euroclear  a Brussels-based central securities depository. Interest earned on Moscow’s frozen assets is already being used to fund a separate loan program for Ukraine organised by the Group of Seven major world powers  and this would not be impacted by the EU’s new proposal.,neutral,0.01,0.77,0.22,mixed,0.42,0.32,0.26,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine reconstruction', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo', 'Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson', 'Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal', 'Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen', 'Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'A World Bank study', 'Brussels-based central securities depository', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Seven major world powers', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'Major European powers', 'gross domestic product', 'next long-term budget', 'EU member states', 'separate loan program', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The Kremlin', 'EU states', 'next decade', 'European banks', 'European Union', 'frozen assets', 'Russian funds', '140 billion euro', 'war reparations', 'risk-sharing aspects', 'financial risks', 'international law', 'Illegal seizure', 'Russian property', 'pure theft', 'financial institutions', 'main depositories', 'investment attractiveness', '210 billion euros', '185 billion euros', 'EU summit', 'European Commission', 'good way', 'one way', 'enormous loan', 'Reparations Loan', 'legal questions', 'good idea', 'new proposal', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'support', 'collateral', 'reconstruction', 'mid-September', '4bn', 'plan', 'Kyiv', 'costs', 'concerns', 'legality', 'scheme', 'Wednesday', 'Denmark', 'Copenhagen', 'meeting', 'place', 'Advertisement', 'divergence', 'agreement', 'everybody', 'lot', 'work', 'reporters', 'sidelines', 'account', 'taxpayers', 'use', 'purpose', 'income', 'actions', 'confidence', 'boomerang', 'countries', 'December', 'year', 'Euroclear', 'Interest', 'Moscow', 'Group', '2.8']",2025-10-01,2025-10-02,aljazeera.com

We are talking about theft ” Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “If someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution in one way or another.”Peskov added that attempts to tap Russia’s sovereign funds would ultimately backfire. “These are all steps towards the complete destruction of trust in the principle of property inviolability. The boomerang will hit countries which host the main depositories and are interested in investment attractiveness very hard ” he warned.Western nations froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets – about two-thirds of which are held by Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear – after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The funds have since generated billions in interest  which the West has sought to channel to Kiev. Last year  the G7 backed a plan to use the interest to secure $50 billion in loans for Kiev  but most initiatives have so far avoided outright confiscation of the funds due to legal barriers and fears over global financial stability.Several member states have already dismissed von der Leyen’s latest proposal  warning it could breach international law. Belgium has been especially critical  with Prime Minister Bart De Wever calling it a “dangerous precedent.” EU leaders are expected to revisit the issue at an informal European Council meeting in Copenhagen later on Wednesday.On Tuesday  a resolution submitted to the US Senate also urged the G7 to seize the funds outright and send them to Ukraine in monthly tranches.Moscow has consistently condemned the asset freeze and any attempt to redirect Russian funds as illegal  and has pledged to retaliate.,neutral,0.0,0.68,0.32,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['latest asset-tapping plan', 'Kremlin', 'boomerang', 'West', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'informal European Council meeting', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'global financial stability', 'Several member states', 'Western financial system', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Western nations', 'Russian assets', 'US lawmakers', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'defense industry', 'EU-made weapons', 'illegal seizure', 'legal prosecution', 'sovereign funds', 'complete destruction', 'main depositories', 'investment attractiveness', 'most initiatives', 'outright confiscation', 'legal barriers', 'international law', 'US Senate', 'monthly tranches', 'asset freeze', 'Russian property', 'reparations loan', 'property inviolability', 'Russian funds', 'Ukraine aid', 'one way', 'Ukraine conflict', 'latest proposal', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'EU leaders', 'plans', 'lawsuits', 'trust', 'remarks', '€140 billion', 'profits', 'bloc', 'part', 'Kiev', 'theft', 'reporters', 'Wednesday', 'someone', 'attempts', 'steps', 'principle', 'boomerang', 'countries', 'two-thirds', 'escalation', 'billions', 'interest', 'G7', 'loans', 'fears', 'issue', 'Copenhagen', 'Tuesday', 'resolution', 'Moscow']",2025-10-01,2025-10-02,rt.com
53041,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rte.ie/news/2025/1001/1536243-frozen-russian-assets/,Hopes for glidepath on how EU uses frozen Russian assets,Just days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the US administration worked with G7 countries to freeze some $300 billion in Russian assets kept in various holdings from foreign currencies to government bonds.,"Just days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the US administration worked with G7 countries to freeze some $300 billion in Russian assets kept in various holdings from foreign currencies to government bonds.After Russia had invaded Crimea in 2014  Moscow had moved most of its overseas assets out of the US and into Europe  assuming it would be safer there.For that reason  the bulk of Russia's assets - some €194 billion - have remained frozen in Euroclear  a Belgium-based central securities depository.EU member states  and Belgium in particular  have been reluctant to seize those assets and use them to help Ukraine. The arguments have been that there is sovereign immunity  underpinned by international law  to protect a country's overseas assets.The ECB also expressed concern that seizing the assets would undermine the euro’s credibility and discourage third country central banks from holding euro-denominated assets.Counter arguments have suggested that states can carry out measures that would otherwise be illegal against a state that has violated the fundamental rules of international law.The Kyiv School of Economics has also argued that the euro's share in global reserves has remained stable at 20%  broadly unchanged since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.The Russian assets have generated profits (interest) and some of that has been used. In October 2024  G7 countries agreed on a €45bn loan to Ukraine which would be repaid by future profits generated by the assets.However  the amount of accruing interest is falling  and  as the war has dragged on  there is more pressure on the EU to finally start putting the frozen assets to greater use.In December last year  the UN  World Bank  Ukraine and the European Commission jointly estimated that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine amounted to $524 billion.The other pressure is coming from the United States.Congress has already passed the REPO act which allows the US to seize Russian assets in order to pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine (only €4.3 billion in Russian Central Bank assets are thought to reside in the US).President Trump has signalled that he is going to taper off US funding for Ukraine’s defence - the US will still provide the weapons  but only if the EU pays for them.EU officials acknowledge this will mean a significant funding gap for Ukraine’s defence.Given the debate over the country’s security guarantees  the mainstream view among EU capitals is that Ukraine itself is the first line of defence for Europe  and that it needs funding to ensure that continues  particularly in scaling up drone manufacturing.The recent drone incursions in Denmark  and the Russian fighter jet intrusions into Estonian airspace  have led planners to believe the Russian threat is now concrete rather than abstract.The Russian assets are now back in the spotlight.The European Commission has proposed using the assets to fund a new €140bn loan for Kyiv.Under the proposal  Ukraine would only have to pay the loan back once Russia starts paying reparations after the war.Read more:Latest Ukraine storiesIn that sense  the assets would not be ""seized"". The approach would require other member states to underwrite the arrangement  and that has drawn contrasting degrees of enthusiasm from national capitals. France  in particular  does not want any guarantee to complicate its already perilous balance sheet.Belgium  which hosts Euroclear  is also adamant that any risk must be shared.In an important shift  German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week signalled he would support such a loan.The mechanism could be created and underpinned by a ""coalition of the willing"" rather than all 27 EU governments  as a way of sidestepping any potential veto by Hungary.While today’s summit in Copenhagen is an informal one - meaning no formal decisions can be adopted - officials hope the huddle will provide a glidepath for a decision at the formal EU summit in Brussels later in October.""There needs to be political guidance on whether they are ready to work on this in order to use the immobilised assets for the financing of Ukraine "" says a senior EU official.",neutral,0.38,0.53,0.09,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Hopes', 'glidepath', 'EU', 'Belgium-based central securities depository', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian fighter jet intrusions', 'third country central banks', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'perilous balance sheet', 'recent drone incursions', 'senior EU official', 'significant funding gap', 'new €140bn loan', 'other member states', 'The Kyiv School', 'The European Commission', 'EU member states', 'Latest Ukraine stories', 'formal EU summit', 'World Bank', 'The ECB', 'Russian threat', 'drone manufacturing', 'formal decisions', 'Russian assets', 'United States', 'EU capitals', '27 EU governments', 'full-scale invasion', 'G7 countries', 'various holdings', 'foreign currencies', 'government bonds', 'sovereign immunity', 'international law', 'fundamental rules', 'global reserves', 'greater use', 'other pressure', 'REPO act', 'President Trump', 'security guarantees', 'mainstream view', 'first line', 'Estonian airspace', 'contrasting degrees', 'national capitals', 'important shift', 'potential veto', 'informal one', 'political guidance', 'overseas assets', 'euro-denominated assets', '€45bn loan', 'frozen assets', 'immobilised assets', 'EU officials', 'Counter arguments', 'future profits', 'US administration', 'US funding', 'February', 'Crimea', 'Moscow', 'reason', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'concern', 'credibility', 'measures', 'Economics', 'share', 'start', 'interest', 'October', 'amount', 'accruing', 'war', 'December', 'cost', 'rebuilding', 'Congress', 'order', 'defence', 'weapons', 'debate', 'Denmark', 'planners', 'spotlight', 'proposal', 'reparations', 'sense', 'approach', 'arrangement', 'enthusiasm', 'France', 'risk', 'mechanism', 'coalition', 'willing', 'way', 'Hungary', 'Copenhagen', 'huddle', 'glidepath', 'Brussels', 'financing']",2025-10-01,2025-10-02,rte.ie

Related Reading: Ukrainians Shield From War’s Economic Impact With Bitcoin  Cry…,Trusted Editorial content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. content  reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad DisclosureGlobal stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group and German multinational corporation Deutsche Börse Group have unveiled their collaboration to expand stablecoin adoption in Europe.Circle Partners With Deutsche Börse For Stablecoin ExpansionOn Tuesday  Circle and Deutsche Börse Group announced they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to integrate the global issuer’s euro and dollar stablecoins  EURC and USDC  within the international exchange organization’s financial market infrastructure.According to the joint statement  the collaboration aims to bring “new solutions” for market participants in Europe by connecting token-based payment networks with traditional financial market infrastructure. It also seeks to advance the regulated adoption of stablecoins in European markets.Circle and Deutsche Börse plan to initially focus on listing and trading stablecoins on the German corporation’s digital exchange 3DX and institutional provider Crypto Finance. Moreover  the partnership is set to enable institutional-grade digital asset custody via Deutsche Börse’s post-trade business  Clearstream  leveraging the German entity of Crypto Finance as sub-custodian.Co-Founder  Chairman  and CEO of Circle  Jeremy Allaire  affirmed that the collaboration will “advance the use of regulated stablecoins across Europe’s market infrastructure—reducing settlement risk  lowering costs  and improving efficiency for banks  asset managers  and the wider market.”“As clear rules take hold across Europe  aligning our regulated stablecoins  EURC and USDC  with trusted venues will unlock new products and streamline workflows across trading  settlement  and custody ” he added.The partnership follows the recent initiative by nine major European banks to deploy a MiCAR-compliant stablecoin next year. As reported by Bitcoinist  Italian banking giant UniCredit  alongside ING  Banca Sella  KBC  Danske Bank  DekaBank  SEB  CaixaBank  and Raiffeisen Bank International  have formed a consortium to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin to “fill the need for a trusted  regulated solution for on-chain payments and settlement.”EU Regulatory Landscape Faces Stablecoin ChallengeAs the announcement noted  the initiative is enabled by the European Union’s (EU) Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCAR)  the bloc’s comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies  which covers areas such as the issuance and custody of digital assets. Circle also highlighted its status as the first major global issuer to achieve compliance with MiCAR.Nonetheless  recent reports affirmed that the European Central Bank (ECB) is pushing for stricter regulations  which could impact how issuers like Circle and Paxos operate across borders. As Bloomberg alleged on Tuesday  the ECB is calling for a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions.According to the report  the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) recently passed a recommendation to ban jointly issued stablecoins  people familiar with the discussions told the news media outlet.Recently  Judith Arnal  an associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Credit Research Institute (ECRI) and board member at the Bank of Spain  discussed the issue in an in-depth analysis for ECRI  affirming that multi-issuance stablecoins would be MiCA’s first “real credibility test”:At the heart of this controversy lies a fundamental tension between regulatory ambition and market reality. The European Central Bank (ECB)  backed by key members of the European Parliament (EP)  argues that multi-issuance structures could undermine the prudential safeguards that MiCA was designed to establish  potentially exposing European holders to risks from third-country issuers and weakening EU monetary sovereignty. The European Commission  meanwhile  has sought to resolve the matter through internal administrative procedures  avoiding the political debate that the ECB and EP believe is necessary.Despite being supported by a high-powered board of central bank governors and EU officials  the guidance is not legally binding  noted Bloomberg. However  it will reportedly pressure EU authorities to “implement the restrictions or explain how financial stability can be preserved in their absence.”Arnal considers that “this institutional standoff has created regulatory paralysis with far-reaching consequences ” which risks “undermining MiCA’s credibility as a coherent and globally influential regulatory framework – just as other jurisdictions  notably the US  are establishing clear and competitive alternatives.”Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $112 956 in the one-week chart.

It also swung to a profit of €7.7m for the year  compared with steep losses of €7m in 2023.The injection of capital by 100pc ­owner AIB came in December of 2024  the accounts show.Its the first major investment since the business was bought in 2021 for €138m.The capital contribution in December 2024 is to support future growth opportunities  according to the filed accounts – that suggests the broker may now be in the hunt for acquisitions  as well as providing significant scope for organic expansion. It is in addition to retained earnings  which last year’s profit helped lift to €55.6m.Goodbody Stockbrokers has been linked this year to a potential bid for BCP Asset Management  thought to be valued at under €15m.That would fit with comments by AIB’s chief financial officer Donal Galvin earlier this year  when he said the banking group was interested in building up its wealth-management businesses in Ireland  if acquisitions were on the cards  rather than looking to move into the UK or other overseas markets.The wealth-management segment has becoming increasingly competitive as domestic and international firms look to build-up scale in the Irish market  where a decade of economic growth and a growing and increasingly wealth population has created a significant “mass affluent” market with relatively little tradition of investing beyond savings  property and household-name shares.AIB’s “wealth” businesses include full ownership of Goodbody Stockbrokers and its AIB Life partnership with Great-West Lifeco.The latest Goodbody accounts show it paid an initial €2.975m in 2023 when it bought a 75pc stake in environmental  social and governance (ESG) advisory consultancy Clearstream Solutions  seen as a potential growth area for the business.The broker has an option in place to potential buy the balance of that business next year.The results show the business had 399 staff in 2024 and a wage bill of €46.5m.

Our extraordinary team has transformed a private biotech into a company listed on Euronext and NASDAQ that is recognized today as a leader in the MASH field. I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished and deeply grateful to all who have contributed to this journey. I am confident that Inventiva will continue to thrive and deliver on its mission to transform the MASH treatment landscape.”Andrew Obenshain  CEO of Inventiva  said: ""Thanks to Frédéric’s leadership  lanifibranor has emerged as one of the most advanced and differentiated therapeutic candidates in late-stage development for MASH. My focus will be on preparing the organization for potential global commercialization so that we are ready to serve patients worldwide. Inventiva combines scientific excellence and a genuine focus on patients  which are the essential ingredients to evolve the standard of care in MASH.

The transfer of Heidsieck & C° Monopole’s business to LANSON-BCC will take effect from January 1  2026.The transaction will also include  for an additional amount  the brand’s great historic vintages of the House of Heidsieck & C° Monopole  including bottles from 1907 recovered from the wreck of the Jönköping sunk in the Baltic Sea  and the transfer of stocks of products already packaged under the brand at the time of the final completion of the operation.The offer from LANSON-BCC being more attractive than the offer from Compagnie Vranken  which was approved by the General Assembly of Vranken-Pommery Monopole on June 5  Compagnie Vranken has withdrawn its bid for the shares of Heidsieck & C° Monopole. However  it has confirmed its offer to acquire  for its subsidiary Maison Pompadour  stocks of Champagne from the Vranken-Pommery Monopole group  so that the debt reduction objective announced in June will be achieved.For Vranken-Pommery Monopole  this operation is part of its strategy to refocus its activity around the international brand Champagne Pommery & Greno. As announced at the General Assembly last June  the group’s name will change to Maison Pommery & Associés on January 1  2026.Nathalie Vranken  CEO of Vranken-Pommery Monopole  commented: “We are very pleased with this transaction  which marks an important milestone in debt reduction. I am convinced that this operation will mobilize all our teams and energy around our shared project focused on value creation and our commitments to sustainability. In 2026  Maison Pommery & Greno will celebrate its 190th anniversary and Maison Vranken its 50th  this double anniversary will be a unique opportunity to take a new step in the development of our Maison Pommery & Associés project.”For the LANSON-BCC group  the acquisition aims to provide Maison Burtin with its own identity  which will contribute to its long-term sustainability. Maison Burtin has historically been a producer of “custom-made” champagnes for major European accounts and owns all the teams and assets necessary for the development of Heidsieck & C° Monopole Champagnes  notably several high-quality grape contracts with 650 Champagne winegrowers  who will thus find a valuable outlet for their work.Bruno Paillard  Chairman & CEO of LANSON-BCC  stated: “Each of the Houses within the LANSON-BCC Group defends its specific style  its own identity  its DNA in the markets. Maison Burtin has all the assets required to serve  at the highest level  the quality of Heidsieck & C° Monopole Champagnes.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext: PHARM; Nasdaq: PHAR) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking approval for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  as a treatment for children aged 4 to 11 years with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency. The application has been granted Priority Review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of January 31  2026.The sNDA submitted to the FDA is based on positive data from the multinational  single-arm Phase III study in children aged 4 to 11 years  which showed improvements over 12 weeks in two clinically relevant hallmarks of the condition  reduced lymphadenopathy and increased naïve B cells  together indicating a correction of the underlying immune defect. The submission also included safety data from 8 months of treatment.The FDA grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that  if approved  would offer significant improvements in effectiveness or safety of the treatment  prevention  or diagnosis of serious conditions.1 There are no approved treatments for children with APDS under the age of 12 years globally.Fabrice Chouraqui  Chief Executive Officer of Pharming  commented:“APDS is a rare  complex  and progressive primary immunodeficiency. Typically  it begins in early childhood causing immune dysregulation  recurrent infections and potentially permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Early access to targeted therapies has the potential to change the trajectory of the disease for young patients. Today’s Priority Review designation marks a significant step for children aged 4-11 in the U.S. living with APDS.”Leniolisib  marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S.  received approval from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation2 3 4 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the U.S.  U.K.  Australia and Israel as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the coprimary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency seen in these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.9 10 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Japan  Canada and several other countries for APDS. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS and in two Phase II clinical trials in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation. The safety and efficacy of leniolisib has not been established for PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

By diverting waste from landfills to produce low-carbon methanol  it will enable to reduce CO 2 emissions in hard-to-abate sectors and use of renewable fuels. The project supports European ambitions for circularity and the broader transition to a more sustainable industrial model.Utilizing Enerkem’s cutting-edge gasification technology  the facility will process up to 400 000 tons of residual municipal waste annually and produce approximately 240 000 tons of methanol  a renewable alternative that can be used to manufacture new circular materials and to produce advanced biofuels.As part of its role in the project  Technip Energies has been awarded two contracts covering the entire delivery scope: one for the Enerkem Core Process  developed in partnership between Enerkem and Technip Energies  and the other for the Balance of Plant  ensuring the integration of all the project units.Under these contracts  Technip Energies will provide engineering and procurement services. The company will also oversee the integration of Enerkem’s groundbreaking gasification technology  which converts non-recyclable waste into renewable fuels and chemicals. Building on the strategic collaboration agreement signed between Technip Energies and Enerkem in 2024  this award illustrates the strength of the partnership in accelerating the deployment of circular solutions at scale.The project is co-funded by the European Union’s Innovation Fund and is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4 million tons of CO 2 -equivalent over its first ten years of operation.Sylvain Cabalery  SVP Business Line Sustainable Fuels  Chemicals & Circularity at Technip Energies  commented: “We are honored to be part of the Ecoplanta project  a landmark in circularity and a breakthrough for waste-based feedstock transformation in Europe. These awards build on the strategic partnership we established with Enerkem last year and underscore our shared commitment to scaling circular solutions. Supporting the first commercial-scale facility of its kind in Europe illustrates our commitment for a more circular and sustainable future in the Iberian Peninsula  and the ability of our Technology  Products and Services (TPS) segment in driving innovation.”These awards will be recorded in Q3 2025 backlog in the Technology  Products & Services segment.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a global technology and engineering powerhouse.

53061,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/10/01/k-m-count-nikos-adonis-and-floridis-theodoropoulos-buyout-the-new-blow-to-attica-group-and-chrysikos-suit/,K.M.  Count Nikos  Adonis and Floridis  Theodoropoulos’ buyout  the new blow to Attica Group  and Chrysikos’ suit,– Greetings  yesterday’s cabinet meeting was a very interesting one – not only because of the agenda  but also because of how the discussion unfolded among ministers. It was indeed perhaps one of the rare times that a real open political discussion took place…,Newsroom October 1 12:45– Greetings  yesterday’s cabinet meeting was a very interesting one – not only because of the agenda  but also because of how the discussion unfolded among ministers. It was indeed perhaps one of the rare times that a real open political discussion took place in the cabinet  moving away from the usual boilerplate about bills and so on.It all started with Mitsotakis himself  but “on the ground” – that is  on the actual bill – praising the excellent job Count Nikos (Dendias) did regarding the reforms in the Army  congratulating his minister. Surely K.M. meant it  that Dendias indeed did very impressive work for the Armed Forces  but I get the feeling he was also playing a bit with the… rumor mill suggesting that practically all vested interests are pushing him as leader of the – “yeah right  and pigs can fly” – ongoing change dreamt up by those who can’t stand Mitsotakis.People say: what’s going on here  we’re touting him for leader and at the same time Mitsotakis himself is singing his praises? Anyway  in the same spirit  taa-daa  Floridis jumped in  saying something like: bravo Nikos  tremendous reforms  not like what our enemies call us – sellouts and traitors – when in fact we’ve secured the best defense procurements for Greece  strengthened our defense and of course the country’s standing against Turkey. And then  just to top it off  Adonis entered the conversation  and backing up Floridis  added: “this proves that our defense policy  which is integrated with our foreign policy  constitutes an overall success for the government.” And… he also threw a jab at “the disgusting front pages of the vested interests portraying us as submissive and weak.” Well  with such courtesies from Adonis  Dendias couldn’t help but reply  thanking him and agreeing about the unity of foreign and defense policy. The conversation then wrapped up with a suggestion from K.M. along the lines of: “yes  that’s right  but make sure you also go out there and say it on TV…”. Now  I’ve conveyed the gist and not word-for-word  but… you get the picture.Transfers and consulates– There was also discussion about the Plevris–Voloudakis bill on legal migration and the use of migrants in the labor market. The discussion  of course  also touched on illegal migration and the need to keep up the “big wall” regarding flows  since from 2026 the new Migration Pact will apply and Greece will have to accept those entering through it and moving on to other countries. But for legal migration  everyone stressed that procedures must be sped up and especially simplified in the foreign consulates  where thousands of prospective workers are waiting in vain for an interview. In some cases  perhaps the required interview could be skipped if the applicant’s profile has already been vetted. Plevris gave an example: why should an Egyptian arriving by sea apply for asylum and be working within two months  while another applying at the consulate – already screened by the Egyptian government – has to wait ten months for a visa? In fact  Labor Minister Niki Kerameos noted that the gaps in the labor market are in the hundreds of thousands  obviously far more than what the bill covers.Papamimikos at M.M.– People are coming and going daily at M.M.  holding meetings with government officials. One of them was lawyer Andreas Papamimikos  who also sits on the board of Open TV and is in talks regarding the station’s relationship with the government. So yesterday  before the cabinet meeting  he was spotted leaving M.M.  where he had a meeting  and on the side entrance on Vasileos Georgiou Street he “bumped into” Deputy Finance Minister Giorgos Kotsiras.Takis’ busy October– The codification of consumer law presented yesterday at the Cabinet by Theodorikakos will be the first step in the initiatives being launched by the Ministry of Development. Upon these codified provisions will be “mounted” the new Authority for market supervision  modeled after the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE). Both bills will head to Parliament in October  which looks set to be a “packed” month for Takis.The reappearance of Karamanlis– On Wednesday 15/10  the Panathenaic Women’s Organization will hold an event at the Old Parliament honoring Anna Psarouda-Benaki  the first female Speaker of Parliament and President of the Academy of Athens. There  Karamanlis (of Rafina) will speak publicly for the first time in a while. Next week he’ll also attend Stylianidis’ book event  but as I’d written in advance  he won’t be speaking there. After sketching the profile of the honoree  his office says he’ll make some general remarks about institutions  the rule of law  etc. Now  how general or pointed those remarks will be  we’ll see in practice – though his aides are keeping expectations low.After Nika… Theodoropoulos goes vegan – Buying “3P Salads”– The money (well  whatever it was…) that Spiros Theodoropoulos’ Bespoke SGA got from the sale of “Nikas” to “Yfantis” seems to be finding its way. As of yesterday  rumors of an impending buyout of the up-and-coming Karditsa-based company “3P Salads ” specializing in so-called “spreads” in the HORECA sector  have been swirling. The company  with revenue around €19 million in 2024  could pair ideally with the already acquired “Ambrosia ” which also operates in spreads  thus achieving both expansion of activity and valuable synergies… The entrepreneur’s official stance  however  remains: “reshuffles  currency devaluations  and acquisitions are not announced in advance!”Grivalia Hospitality: Chrysikos’ suit hid €55 million in losses (pre-tax)– The market was informed of Grivalia Hospitality’s big revenue jump last year – €85.1 million compared to €44 million in 2023 – but not of its losses. According to the financial statements posted in GEMI  the group posted operating losses (before tax and interest) of €39.3 million  compared to €47.4 million in 2023  while pre-tax losses came to €55 million versus €57 million. The revenue increase mainly came from the full-year operation of the One & Only resort in 2024  since in 2023 it only began operations in November  so the two years aren’t fully comparable. Should we assume the same applies to the losses too?The Bank of Greece chair and the heir apparent– It’s still early to talk about the next leadership at the Bank of Greece  though information suggests that renewing Yannis Stournaras’ term is seen as the most likely – I’d say certain – outcome  if it weren’t so many months until May 2026. Some  however  believe that nothing is guaranteed regarding the governor’s chair. That’s why the head of a systemic bank has lately been working his contacts  approaching the right people  etc.The new plan for Patras  Volos  Elefsina  and Alexandroupoli– The Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (Superfund) has drawn up a radical restructuring plan for the management of port infrastructure. According to information  the plan includes mapping out needs for marina berths  infrastructure  and technological equipment  with immediate priority given to four ports: Patras  Elefsina  Volos  and Alexandroupoli. The choice is no accident: Patras is Greece’s western gateway to Italy; Elefsina is critical for decongesting Piraeus; Volos controls Thessaly and the Balkans; while Alexandroupoli is now a geostrategic hub for the Eastern Mediterranean and energy security. The Superfund intends to develop these four strategic ports first  ensuring their operational viability before proceeding to broader concessions or utilization. The truth is this ambitious plan faces serious problems  since key permits remain stuck in time-consuming processes. The Council of State needs 12–18 months to approve a master plan  which in today’s pace of international investment equals immediate loss of competitiveness. The Environmental Permitting Directorate (DYPA) also takes up to 12 months to issue environmental permits. These delays make Greece look outdated compared to competitors like Spain  Portugal  or even Croatia.Unlikely that Euronext will change its proposal for the Athens Exchange– I think we’re in the final countdown to learning the details of Euronext’s public offer for HELEX. Both supporters and opponents of the proposal are equally confident in its success or failure. Meanwhile  HELEX’s stock is dropping (closing yesterday at €6.64) since its moves on the board are now tied to Euronext’s share price fluctuations. At the same time  Euronext is making its rounds in Athens and abroad  and sources claim that CEO Stéphane Boujnah  despite his keen interest in acquiring the Athens Stock Exchange  will not be changing his offer “not by a single cent.” On the other hand  Athens brokers believe that the buyout – even with just a share swap – cannot have double standards regarding HELEX’s valuation. “It’s not acceptable to value HELEX 30% cheaper at best  and without cash…” Boujnah  meeting with listed companies who view his project positively  politely but firmly warns that the Athens Exchange urgently needs major investment in its technological infrastructure – something that can be delivered much faster  easier  and cheaper within Euronext. Without saying it outright  Boujnah applies pressure by asking: “If the marriage with Euronext doesn’t happen  then what is the future of the Athens Exchange?”Fourth blow for Attica Group – Emissions torpedo– Piraeus Bank  as shareholder  desperately wants it – especially now that tourism is booming – but market conditions don’t allow for the placement of Attica Group shares. After the passenger who drowned when thrown into the sea as the ferry departed  then the recent death of the 20-year-old crew member  the open wound of investments for fleet greening  now came the bill for emissions rights. While waiting for the third quarter – theoretically the strongest – Attica Group recorded a plunge in gross profits and EBITDA  with first-half losses widening significantly. One reason is the higher cost of emissions rights  due to new EU environmental regulations being phased in. What happened? From May 1  2025  the Mediterranean is designated a SECA (Sulphur Emission Control Area)  with stricter sulfur emission limits. As a result  ships without exhaust scrubbers must use more expensive low-sulfur fuel (MGO). In addition  from January 1  2025  the FuelEU regulation came into force  requiring greater use of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Thus  despite higher turnover  consolidated gross profits fell to €5.6 million versus €35.8 million in H1 2024  while EBITDA dropped to €4.1 million from €19.5 million. After tax  losses reached €52.3 million  compared to €23.8 million in H1 2024. The cost of emissions rights came to €18.8 million for H1 2025  weighing on cost of goods sold. Add in the already rising fleet operating costs due to inflationary pressures (maintenance  supplies  crew wages)  and losses were to be expected. Notably  Group administrative expenses fell to €25.9 million from €34.6 million a year earlier. The financial statements show that by the end of June  Attica Group had total debt obligations of €587.3 million. So how will the group handle the situation? It has already begun installing new technologies on its ships to improve fleet energy efficiency (Energy Saving Devices  Scrubbers) and reduce its environmental footprint  while continuing its investment program in that direction.Trump’s Tariffs and the Greek Shipowners-Greek shipowners and executives of the Greek-owned shipping industry don’t mince their words when it comes to the U.S. trade war  seizing every chance to speak out. Aristides Pittas  head of Euroseas  EuroDry and Euroholdings  downplays the importance of American tariffs: “I see the Trump issue as just a parenthesis and a lot of noise  really. It’s a phase we’re going through and it will stop.” In other words  he considers the phenomenon temporary  without long-term weight. John Coustas  head of Danaos  underlined China’s resilience  pointing out that COSCO —the only Chinese company really hit by U.S. port tariffs— has made it clear it will defend its market share  no matter the cost. He himself described the U.S. measures as “irrational ” estimating that in the end they will be withdrawn: “I have it in the back of my mind that these will be lifted once a better agreement is reached between China and the U.S.”And yet: There are shipowners complaining-Shipowners complaining? Not something we’re used to — but the Board of the Union of Coastal Shipping Shipowners is in emergency mode. Its president  Babis Simantonis  said it openly during the special event where the IOBE study was presented: If immediate investments aren’t made by changing the operating framework  Short Sea Shipping is heading straight for collapse. The margins have shrunk. Even the deputy minister of Shipping and Island Policy  Corfiot Stefanos Gikas  who closely follows developments  is asking for adjustments in development tools — and fast. But while Athens is still searching for solutions  Ankara is taking all the business: the Turks have both ships and seafarers. And here lies the thorn: Greek law “punishes” a vessel that flies the Greek flag  thus trapping Short Sea Shipping in a dead end. Greek shortsea shipping stands at a crossroads: either it will be supported through targeted policies and investments  or it will see its role fade — with major costs for the economy  island communities  and the environment.Europe arms up  Mevaco levels up-Mevaco is a company listed on the Athens Stock Exchange  active in photovoltaics and defense systems. Over the last 12 months —since Europe’s armaments frenzy began— its value has shot up by +78.3%  reaching €84 million. Three years ago  in 2022  it signed a framework agreement with France’s Naval Group for the supply of mechanical systems for the Hellenic Navy’s FDI frigates. In March 2025  it signed a two-year agreement with Intracom Defense worth $6.06 million  for manufacturing metal parts for defense systems with an export orientation. Today  its order backlog amounts to €41 million. To meet surging demand  Mevaco (+21.9% at €8.35) is investing €10 million to build a new factory unit next to its existing facilities  on a privately-owned adjacent plot of 26 acres  where a state-of-the-art industrial plant will be installed. In 2024  Mevaco’s turnover was €60.8 million (+41.52%)  while EBITDA came in at €7.6 million (+54.9%). In the first half of 2025  turnover skyrocketed to €49.22 million (+207.3%) and gross profits to €15.68 million (+328.7%). Based on first-half operating profits (€10.2 million)  the current capitalization of €84 million seems logical — within the madness of wars.A new acquisition in the IT sector-The new trend in the Greek IT market is Agentic AI and automation projects in the private sector of the economy. Profile Software (-2.71% at €6.82) is preparing to announce —next week— a major acquisition of a Greek System Integrator specializing in Cybersecurity. It will combine the expertise of the acquisition with its own significant upgrade of the AI Adaptive solution  introducing advanced capabilities with agents that redefine smart automation and transform how financial institutions operate  requiring minimal human intervention. Interestingly  right now at Messe Frankfurt —one of the largest exhibition venues in the world— the SIBOS (SWIFT International Banking Operations Seminar) is taking place  the top global conference and exhibition of financial services organized annually by the global payments system SWIFT. The central (perhaps only) topic at SIBOS is Agentic AI  meaning systems that can operate autonomously and make decisions with minimal human oversight. In Frankfurt these days are executives of Eurobank  Piraeus Bank  and Profile.It doesn’t want to fall  it can’t go up-The first of the two tough autumn months passed for the Athens Stock Exchange not only without losses  but even with small gains: +0.62% for the General Index and +6.02% for the Banking Index. This completes 11 consecutive rising months —something the Athens Stock Exchange last saw 39 years ago (1986–1987). Yesterday’s session carried a clear message: “I have no direction  I don’t know where to go.” The big Eurobank block trade of €99.88 million (+0.21% at €3.382) and Alpha Bank transactions worth €83.6 million (+1.52% at €3.6140) gave a taste of month-end  quarter-end  and nine-month-end window dressing. The third quarter brought +11.09% for the General Index and +24.2% for the Banking Index. As so often in recent months  the banking sector was the absolute star of the market. National Bank (+0.53% at €12.36) and Piraeus (-0.06% at €7.21) dominated trading  as professionals cashed in profits from smaller banks and shifted to the four systemic ones. In a generally negative session  the General Index’s marginally positive sign was also supported by Athens International Airport (+2.87% at €10.38)  AKTOR (+2.01% at €8.61)  PPC (+0.86% at €14.02)  and Cenergy (+1.5% at €12.20). The General Index closed with a loss of -0.01% at 2 034.22 points  while turnover climbed to €368 million with block trades worth €149.8 million. Coca-Cola fought hard to keep the €40 mark (€40.06  -0.5%)  but September was not a good month  leaving it with total losses of -6.88%. Also noteworthy was PPA (+3.15% at €44.15)  though with transactions too thin to suggest a broader upward trend.Shipping weddings and baptisms-George Stefanou married off his son and baptized his triplet granddaughters last weekend  while two weeks earlier his brother  Dimitris  had married off his daughter. I heard the coasts of Vouliagmeni and Varkiza lit up with mega-shows of fireworks  in the presence of hundreds of guests. The two brothers  born and bred in Andros from the famous village of Stenies  have built a major family shipping company with cargo vessels —28 as of today— while showing their love for their homeland by investing in coastal shipping  initially to serve their island and later the rest of the Cyclades. According to XRTC  a financial consultancy specialized in coastal shipping  the Stefanou brothers belong to the small club of big investors in the sector.Alarm bells ring in the U.S.-We may not have paid much attention here  but in the U.S. cannons are booming in the wider auto market —and loudly. The latest casualty is First Brands Group Holdings  a giant in the auto aftermarket parts sector that grew through acquisitions financed by highly leveraged debt. First Brands reached revenues of $5 billion  with its products sold at major retailers such as Walmart and O’Reilly Auto Parts. At the same time  however  its debts skyrocketed: $6 billion in traditional bank loans today  but there are also additional off-balance sheet loans tied to inventories  customer/supplier invoices  etc. In its official bankruptcy filing (Chapter 11)  it declared obligations of between $10–50 billion (!)  while its assets are estimated much lower ($1–10 billion). The case is considered particularly serious because no one knows the true extent of the problem or which suppliers  creditors  or banks are exposed  as much of its debt was incurred via special entities (SPEs) or “gray” financing. Many see similarities with Greensill Capital  whose collapse triggered a domino effect and a crisis of confidence that helped bring down Credit Suisse  since the Swiss group had significant funds tied up in Greensill-related vehicles. Already  there are concerns about the impact on Clearlake Capital (also the largest shareholder of London football club Chelsea)  which owns First Brands. Notably  very recently another shock came from the bankruptcy filing of Tricolor  a lender specializing in car loans to subprime customers.The dance of precious metals-Most investors focus on stock indices and shares. But the secret of our times lies in precious metals. Silver is up +63% year-on-year. One kilo of silver is worth €1 264 today. Gold +46%. One kilo of gold is worth €104 428. This means precious metals —for the second year in a row— are the best-performing investment. Gold and silver have soared +108% and +115% over the past two years. In the same period  the dollar has lost value  recording its worst year since 1973. Precious metals are now seen as a “store of value” in a period of heightened interest rate and currency uncertainty. President Trump is pressuring the Fed for lower rates despite inflationary pressures. The global shift away from the dollar by central banks —especially China and BRICS— accelerates the depreciation. Some thought cryptocurrencies could be the solution. But Bitcoin has tumbled below $109 000  while Ethereum has logged 5 consecutive losing sessions —its worst streak since February— dropping below $4 000 for the first time since early August. The drop exceeds 20% from its historic high near $5 000 just a month ago. The negative real yield of bonds makes metals more attractive. With inflation exceeding interest rates  holding cash equals losing purchasing power. Rising geopolitical tensions and systematic de-dollarization of world trade boost demand for real assets. Gold remains the ultimate central bank reserve. Meanwhile  industrial demand for silver has surged dramatically: silver is essential in green energy and electronics. A structural supply deficit has emerged in silver.Nvidia makes history: Now worth $4.5 trillion– Just a few years ago  Nvidia was simply the darling of gamers. Thirty months ago  Nvidia was worth only $500 billion. At the end of 2022  OpenAI brought ChatGPT to the global market. Then came the explosion. Nvidia hit $1 trillion in May 2023  $2 trillion in February 2024  and $3 trillion in June 2024. Artificial Intelligence demands Nvidia’s chips and infrastructure. Its CEO  Jensen Huang  is now the 10th richest person in the world  with a net worth of over $140 billion.,neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,mixed,0.33,0.16,0.52,True,English,"['K.M.', 'Count Nikos', 'Theodoropoulos’ buyout', 'new blow', 'Attica Group', 'Chrysikos’ suit', 'Adonis', 'Floridis', 'Deputy Finance Minister Giorgos Kotsiras', 'Labor Minister Niki Kerameos', 'real open political discussion', 'disgusting front pages', 'Vasileos Georgiou Street', 'first female Speaker', 'best defense procurements', 'lawyer Andreas Papamimikos', 'Stylianidis’ book event', 'new Migration Pact', 'Count Nikos (Dendias', 'Plevris–Voloudakis bill', 'labor market', 'bravo Nikos', 'Open TV', 'new Authority', 'first step', 'first time', 'legal migration', 'interesting one', 'rare times', 'usual boilerplate', 'actual bill', 'excellent job', 'K.M.', 'impressive work', 'Armed Forces', 'rumor mill', 'ongoing change', 'same time', 'same spirit', 'defense policy', 'overall success', 'big wall', 'other countries', 'prospective workers', 'two months', 'ten months', 'M.M.', 'side entrance', 'market supervision', 'Independent Authority', 'Public Revenue', 'Panathenaic Women', 'Anna Psarouda-Benaki', '3P Salads', 'Bespoke SGA', 'impending buyout', 'foreign policy', 'tremendous reforms', 'required interview', 'government officials', 'consumer law', 'general remarks', 'Spiros Theodoropoulos', 'Old Parliament', 'cabinet meeting', 'foreign consulates', 'Egyptian government', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'agenda', 'ministers', 'place', 'bills', 'Mitsotakis', 'ground', 'Army', 'feeling', 'bit', 'interests', 'leader', 'pigs', 'People', 'praises', 'daa', 'Floridis', 'something', 'enemies', 'sellouts', 'traitors', 'fact', 'Greece', 'course', 'country', 'Turkey', 'Adonis', 'conversation', 'jab', 'courtesies', 'unity', 'suggestion', 'lines', 'gist', 'word', 'picture', 'Transfers', 'use', 'migrants', 'need', 'flows', 'everyone', 'procedures', 'thousands', 'vain', 'cases', 'applicant', 'profile', 'example', 'sea', 'asylum', 'visa', 'gaps', 'hundreds', 'meetings', 'board', 'talks', 'station', 'relationship', 'October', 'codification', 'Theodorikakos', 'initiatives', 'Ministry', 'Development', 'provisions', 'AADE', 'packed', 'reappearance', 'Karamanlis', 'Wednesday', 'Organization', 'President', 'Academy', 'Athens', 'Rafina', 'advance', 'honoree', 'office', 'institutions', 'rule', 'practice', 'aides', 'expectations', 'Nika', 'money', 'sale', 'Yfantis', 'way', 'yesterday', 'rumors']",2025-10-01,2025-10-02,en.protothema.gr
