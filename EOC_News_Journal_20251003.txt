And this will put us in litigation for many  many years ” the official predicted.De Wever also urged his colleagues to be transparent regarding the Russian assets immobilized in other EU member states.As the US has diminished its involvement in shoring up Ukraine  the so-called Coalition of the Willing – a group of European nations backing Kiev – will have to transform into the “Coalition of the Bill ” the Belgian prime minister said.Also speaking in Copenhagen  Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden similarly spoke of a “whole series of complex legal issues” surrounding the Commission’s scheme.Last month  French President Emmanuel Macron warned that “you cannot seize these assets from the central bank  even in such a situation ” describing it as a “matter of credibility.”On Wednesday  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia viewed the scheme proposed by the EU leadership as “theft ” and warned that those responsible “will be subjected to legal prosecution in one way or another.”He also predicted that the “boomerang will hit countries which host the main depositories.”Back in June  Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the moment the West seizes frozen Russian assets  “the shift toward regional payment systems will accelerate and undoubtedly become irreversible.”,neutral,0.02,0.77,0.21,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['Belgium demands', 'EU guarantees', 'Russian assets', 'Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'other EU member states', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Belgian prime minister', 'many, many years', 'regional payment systems', 'complex legal issues', 'The European Commission', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'EU summit', 'EU leadership', 'frozen funds', 'legal prosecution', 'European nations', 'central-bank assets', 'ironclad guarantees', 'shared responsibility', 'Western nations', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'whole series', 'central bank', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'one way', 'main depositories', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'loans', 'plan', 'escalation', 'reporters', 'sidelines', 'Copenhagen', 'Thursday', 'colleagues', 'signature', 'money', 'interests', 'damages', 'litigation', 'official', 'involvement', 'Coalition', 'Willing', 'group', 'Kiev', 'Bill', 'scheme', 'situation', 'matter', 'credibility', 'Wednesday', 'boomerang', 'countries', 'June', 'moment', 'shift']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,rt.com
53063,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/2/will-europe-use-russian-assets-to-fund-ukraine-could-moscow-hit-back,Will Europe use Russian assets to fund Ukraine? Could Moscow hit back?,Some European countries have raised concerns about potential legal challenges to the 'reparations plan' for Ukraine.,Some European countries have raised concerns about potential legal challenges to the ‘reparations plan’ for Ukraine.European Union leaders are considering a “reparations plan” that would use frozen Russian state assets to provide Ukraine with a $164bn loan to buy European weapons and to help fund its reconstruction after the war with Russia ends.Leaders expressed a mixture of support and caution for the plan on Wednesday as they met in the Danish capital  Copenhagen  days after drones were spotted in Denmark’s airspace  prompting airport closures. While the drones in Denmark were not formally identified as Russian  other European countries  including Poland  Romania and Estonia  have accused Russia of drone incursions into their airspace in September.“I strongly support the idea ” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also said he was “very much in favour” of the plan. Others said there could be legal complications  however.Here is what we know about Europe’s “reparations plan”  how it may work and what the response from Russia is likely to be.What is Europe’s ‘reparations plan’?The reparations plan was first outlined by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in mid-September  and backing for it has grown as United States financial support for Ukraine wanes.During his 2024 presidential campaign  US President Donald Trump promised voters he would pull the US back from providing high levels of financial and military aid to Ukraine.Since the beginning of his term in January  Trump has made it clear the US will take a back seat in terms of providing financial support and security guarantees to Ukraine  indicating Europe should fill the gap instead.AdvertisementEurope’s plan would use Russian assets frozen in European banks as collateral for a 140-billion-euro ($164.4bn) loan to Ukraine. Repayments for the loan would be recouped via war reparations from Russia  but the loan would also be guaranteed either in the EU’s next long-term budget or by individual EU member states.“We need a more structural solution for military support ” von der Leyen said on Tuesday. “This is why I have put forward the idea of a reparations loan that is based on the immobilised Russian assets.”Von der Leyen added: “We will strengthen our own defence industry by ensuring that part of the loan is used for procurement in Europe and with Europe.”How much in frozen Russian assets does Europe hold?About $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Most of this – $246.9bn – is held in Europe  of which $217.5bn – the vast majority in cash – is held by Euroclear  a Belgium-based capital markets company.On June 30  Euroclear reported the Russian sanctioned assets on its balance sheet generated $3.2bn in interest during the first half of 2025  a drop from the $4bn in interest earned over the same period last year.What are the challenges to this plan?Under international law  a sovereign country’s assets cannot simply be confiscated. Hence  loaning this money to Ukraine would be an infringement of Moscow’s sovereign claim over its central bank assets.“The primary challenge is that seizing the assets of a state is only supposed to be a temporary measure and reversible once Russia complies with international law ” Luke Moffett from Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland  told Al Jazeera.“In other words  the EU cannot sell or permanently take Russia’s assets  as this would breach international law and would subject EU assets in Russian territory to similar measures ” said Moffet  whose work focuses on the role of reparations in remedying the consequences of conflict and its place in transitional justice.Since most of the assets are held in Belgium  the country has asked for the plan to be fleshed out in case it is required to return the assets to Russia.“I explained to my colleagues yesterday that I want their signature saying  ‘If we take Putin’s money  we use it  we’re all going to be responsible if it goes wrong’ ” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters in Copenhagen on Thursday.On Wednesday  von der Leyen said: “It’s absolutely clear that Belgium cannot be the one who is the only member state that is carrying the risk. The risk has to be put on broader shoulders.”AdvertisementAre any European leaders hesitant about this plan?Yes. Besides De Wever  other European leaders have expressed hesitation or have asked their fellow leaders to work out more details of the plan before they agree to it.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the proposal should be considered very carefully  given the legal and financial risks that could arise.Others also signalled caution. “I think that’s a difficult legal question ” Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden told reporters. “You can’t just take over assets that belong to another state so easily.”Frieden added: “There are now other proposals on the table  but these also raise a whole host of questions. I would like to have answers to these questions first. Among other things  how would such a loan be repaid? What would happen if Russia did not repay these reparations in a peace treaty?”Another issue  Moffett pointed out  is that “the loan using Russian assets as collateral is to buy weapons from EU countries  so the money just circulates in the EU and benefits arms companies  rather than victims of the war who are going to have to wait until peace to have their harm redressed.”Is the plan likely to go ahead?Experts said European leaders would likely have to find a way to make the plan viable as the prospects of further US aid for Ukraine dry up.“It is going to happen because with the US walking away  Europe is left with $100bn-plus annual funding needs for Ukraine ” Timothy Ash  an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House  told Al Jazeera.Ash explained that the bigger challenge for Europe would be to not go ahead with the plan if it means leaving Ukraine underfunded generally and placing it at higher risk of losing the war with Russia. “Risks to Europe would then be catastrophic ” he said  including the prospect of tens of millions of Ukrainians migrating west into Europe.If a Ukrainian loss in the war becomes more likely  European nations would be forced to ramp up defence spending to 5 percent of their gross domestic product (GDPs) much faster than expected.On the other hand  if Ukraine loses the war after the loan is disbursed  “it won’t have any ability to repay the loan  so the assets could be defaulted”  Moffett said.“It also increases Ukraine’s debt which emerging from the conflict is going to create difficulties in rebuilding the country.”In June  members of NATO pledged to increase their defence spending to 5 percent of their GDPs by 2035.Such an acceleration “would mean higher budget deficits  higher borrowing costs  more debt  less growth and a weaker Europe and euro”  Ash said.How has Russia responded?Moscow has rebuked the EU plan  calling it a “theft” of Russian money.“We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property. In Russia  we call that simply theft ” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.Peskov said anyone involved in seizing Russian assets “will be prosecuted in one way or another. They will all be called to account.”AdvertisementHe added: “The boomerang will very seriously hit those who are the main depositories  countries that are interested in investment attractiveness.”Ash said Russia could take legal action against European countries if the plan goes ahead. However  “it would have to lift its own sovereign immunity to be able to launch any such legal action. And a legal action by Russia would take years – decades to conclude.”Russia is protected by sovereign immunity  which is a legal principle shielding foreign governments from being sued in courts outside their own country. If Russia wants to legally pursue this  it would need to waive this immunity  which  in turn  would mean Russia could also be sued or tried in a foreign country.Ash added that another course of action Russia could take would be to seize Western assets under its jurisdiction  but this also does not come without challenges. “Russia has 10 times more assets in the West than vice versa ” Ash said. “It’s just more vulnerable through this channel.”How much in Western assets does Russia hold?Moscow said the value of all foreign assets it holds is comparable to the frozen Russian reserves held in the West. Citing data from January 2022  Russia’s state-run RIA news agency reported there were about $288bn of assets in Russia that could potentially be seized by Moscow.However  Russian Central Bank records from 2022 show there were $289bn in “derivative and other foreign investments” in Russia. By the end of 2023  these foreign assets had dropped in value to $215bn.Ash explained: “Those assets are all foreign assets – not just Western. [They include] Chinese  Indian  Middle East assets. And most of those assets are private – not state.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson', 'Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof', 'Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen', 'Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden', 'Belgium-based capital markets company', 'US President Donald Trump', 'individual EU member states', 'United States financial support', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'next long-term budget', 'difficult legal question', 'European Union leaders', 'other European countries', 'other European leaders', 'potential legal challenges', 'Danish capital', 'European weapons', 'European banks', 'other words', 'other proposals', 'legal complications', 'military support', 'Russian territory', 'financial risks', 'fellow leaders', 'Russian assets', 'airport closures', 'drone incursions', '2024 presidential campaign', 'high levels', 'military aid', 'back seat', 'security guarantees', 'structural solution', 'defence industry', 'vast majority', 'balance sheet', 'first half', 'same period', 'international law', 'sovereign claim', 'primary challenge', 'temporary measure', 'Luke Moffett', 'University Belfast', 'Northern Ireland', 'Al Jazeera', 'similar measures', 'transitional justice', 'broader shoulders', 'EU assets', '$164bn loan', '$164.4bn) loan', 'sovereign country', 'war reparations', 'reparations loan', 'reparations plan', 'Ukraine wanes', 'concerns', 'reconstruction', 'mixture', 'caution', 'Wednesday', 'Copenhagen', 'drones', 'Denmark', 'airspace', 'Poland', 'Romania', 'Estonia', 'September', 'idea', 'favour', 'Others', 'response', 'voters', 'beginning', 'January', 'terms', 'gap', 'Advertisement', 'collateral', '140-billion-euro', 'Repayments', 'Tuesday', 'part', 'procurement', 'invasion', 'February', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'June', 'interest', 'drop', 'money', 'infringement', 'Moscow', 'Queen', 'work', 'role', 'consequences', 'conflict', 'place', 'case', 'colleagues', 'signature', 'Putin', 'reporters', 'Thursday', 'hesitation', 'details', 'table', 'host', 'questions']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,aljazeera.com

Some of the bloc’s members  however  continued to voice concerns about the legal risks associated with such a step.Most notably  Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever  whose country hosts Euroclear  where most EU-held Russian assets sit  cautioned his colleagues that “there’s no free money. There are always consequences.” “I want their signature saying  if we take [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s money… we’re all going to be responsible if it goes wrong ” he said. Luxembourg’s prime minister  Luc Frieden  voiced similar apprehensions.Commenting on the deliberations on Thursday  Peskov likened the EU to a group of mobsters planning their next heist. “This all looks like a gang: someone keeps lookout  someone robs  and someone  like Belgium  shouts  ‘Guys  let’s share responsibility ” he quipped  adding that those involved would face “legal and other possible accountability.”A day earlier  he said the ideas under discussion amounted to theft. “We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property ” Peskov said  warning such moves would “completely” undermine trust in the inviolability of property and that “the boomerang will very seriously hit” key depository countries.After the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  Western governments froze roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets  about €210 billion of which is in Europe  including some €185 billion at Brussels-based Euroclear. While EU officials have for months discussed ways to confiscate the funds outright and hand them over to Ukraine  they have so far refrained from doing so due to the enormous legal and reputational risks such a move would entail.However  the EU moved to channel the interest accrued by the assets to Ukraine  having already transferred an estimated €4 billion to Kiev.,neutral,0.02,0.7,0.28,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['criminal ‘gang', 'EU', 'Kremlin', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'other possible accountability', 'key depository countries', 'central bank assets', 'EU-held Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'EU countries', 'informal summit', 'Luc Frieden', 'similar apprehensions', 'next heist', 'illegal seizure', 'Russian property', 'Western governments', 'reputational risks', 'legal risks', 'enormous legal', 'EU leaders', 'EU officials', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'criminal “gang', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'free money', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'legal consequences', 'Ukraine conflict', 'bloc', 'Moscow', 'ways', 'Wednesday', 'Copenhagen', 'plan', 'members', 'concerns', 'step', 'Belgium', 'country', 'most', 'colleagues', 'signature', 'Putin', 'Luxembourg', 'deliberations', 'Thursday', 'group', 'mobsters', 'someone', 'shouts', 'responsibility', 'ideas', 'discussion', 'theft', 'moves', 'trust', 'inviolability', 'boomerang', 'escalation', 'Europe', 'months', 'funds', 'interest', 'Kiev']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,rt.com

The outlet said this is one reason why European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has failed to win approval from member states for a new loan plan tied to Russian assets frozen in the bloc.Western nations immobilized about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022  with two-thirds held by Belgium-based Euroclear. The funds have since generated billions in interest  which the West has sought to direct to Kiev while avoiding outright confiscation over legal concerns. Last year the G7 backed using the interest to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine.Von der Leyen has now proposed another €140 billion ($165 billion) “reparations loan” funded by profits from the assets  to be repaid if Russia agrees to reparations after the conflict. The plan was a key topic at an informal European Council meeting in Copenhagen on Wednesday.“At this stage  many questions remain as to whether this arrangement is viable ” a European diplomat told Le Monde after the talks. “We know very well that Kiev will never repay this loan.”Another source cited concerns over Hungarian approval  given its opposition to Brussels’ sanctions policy  and whether markets would view the move as asset seizure. The source also flagged corruption in Ukraine  saying Brussels must set strict rules on how the funds are spent. Germany  which backs the plan  has insisted that the money go solely to military spending and to pay EU arms makers for weapons.Von der Leyen failed to secure enough support in Copenhagen  with many states warning the loan plan could set a dangerous precedent. Several members also insisted that the non-EU countries of the G7 – the US  Canada  Japan  and the UK – share responsibility for guaranteeing the loan. Talks were postponed until the EU summit on October 23-24.Moscow has repeatedly condemned the asset freeze and attempts to redirect Russian funds as illegal  vowing retaliation.

Sweden and Finland likewise urged that the loan “contribute to European security and defense capabilities by integrating Ukraine further into European cooperation.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday that EU plans to use the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine would amount to theft  trigger lawsuits  and erode trust in the Western financial system.“If someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution in one way or another.”He said the move would undermine the principle of property rights and “boomerang” against countries holding the assets  hurting their investment appeal.Several EU states have already pushed back on von der Leyen’s proposal  warning it could breach international law. Belgium has been especially critical  with Prime Minister Bart De Wever calling it a “dangerous precedent.”Western nations froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets – two-thirds of it held by Belgium’s Euroclear – after the escalation of the conflict in 2022.

He added that von der Leyen's plan to use Russian assets is a ""very complicated legal attempt to do an illegal action."" Sakwa noted that large Western business assets remain in Russia  and their owners cannot withdraw them from the country. Sakwa said that a number of Western business representatives had tried to maintain normal relations with Russia  and expressed the opinion that confiscating their assets in response to the EU's actions would be a mistake. In mid-September  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed creating a new ""reparations loan"" to finance Ukraine's war effort by leveraging billions in frozen Russian sovereign assets held in European banks. Under the plan  Ukraine will repay the loan after Russia pays ""reparations."" On September 25  the Financial Times newspaper reported that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz proposed that the EU provide Ukraine with an interest-free loan of around 140 billion euros ($164 billion) drawn from frozen Russian assets. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever criticized Merz's proposal on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly  saying that an attempt to seize state assets would set a dangerous precedent not only for Belgium but for the EU as a whole. After the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 froze almost half of Russian foreign currency reserves  totaling some 300 billion euros. About 200 billion euros is held in European accounts  mainly by Belgium's Euroclear  one of the world's largest clearing houses. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of Russia's central bank money in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow could respond by withholding assets held in Russia by Western countries.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251001/europe-may-decide-on-russian-assets-in-the-coming-days---british-expert-1122895562.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20250705/head-of-ryanair-airline-calls-ursula-von-der-leyen-useless-politician-1122397151.htmlrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalproviding kiev with a loan secured by frozen russian assets will undermine the confidence of foreign investors from the global south in europe and the euro in particular  richard sakwa  a uk political scientist and professor emeritus of political science at kent university  said.",neutral,0.01,0.91,0.09,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Russian Frozen Assets', 'Loan', 'Ukraine', 'Confidence', 'Europe', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'Russian foreign currency reserves', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'large Western business assets', 'central bank money', 'Western business representatives', 'sergey lavrov russia', 'Russian Frozen Assets', 'Financial Times newspaper', 'UN General Assembly', 'special military operation', 'largest clearing houses', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'UK political scientist', 'complicated legal attempt', 'ukraine european union', 'new ""reparations loan', 'foreign investors', 'Russian assets', 'European banks', 'European accounts', 'Western countries', 'political science', 'state assets', 'Sputnik International', 'Global South', 'professor emeritus', 'Kent University', 'illegal action', 'normal relations', 'war effort', '140 billion euros', 'dangerous precedent', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'interest-free loan', 'Richard Sakwa', 'EU leaders', 'Europe Loan', 'russia ukraine', 'sputnikglobe', 'russian-frozen-assets', 'undermine-confidence', 'Kiev', 'economy', 'cdn', 'Wednesday', 'consensus', 'revenues', 'plan', 'owners', 'country', 'number', 'opinion', 'response', 'actions', 'mistake', 'mid-September', 'billions', 'proposal', 'sidelines', 'Belgium', 'start', 'G7', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'freezing', 'theft', 'Moscow', 'russian-assets', 'coming-days', 'british-expert', 'ryanair-airline-calls', 'useless-politician', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,sputnikglobe.com

However Belgium  whose approval is critical because it hosts Euroclear  reiterated concerns about the plan and sought assurances that its financial interests would be protected.Earlier  Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen  who hosted the summit  told reporters that the bloc sees financial support to Ukraine as critical. “And I think that the idea from the Commission is actually quite a good way forward ” she said.The European plan seeks to resolve several problems simultaneously.The EU and its allies have demanded that Russia pay reparations to Ukraine for war’s damage  though they acknowledge that the Kremlin is unlikely to agree to do so. The notion of confiscating the assets created fears that foreign investors would reduce investments in eurozone assets and worries about setting precedents.The ECB  which oversees the euro  has a direct stake because Euroclear has moved Russian cash reserves to the central bank once the underlying Russian investments it held have come due.Russia  meanwhile  has warned that it would retaliate if its funds were confiscated.The EU couldn’t issue debt to fund Ukraine as it has in the past because it likely wouldn’t have won backing from Hungary and Slovakia who have grown hostile to assisting Ukraine.With the Trump administration largely cutting off its spending on military aid for Ukraine  EU and its European partners must foot the bill for Ukraine and military assistance to it. That could easily exceed EUR70 billion—or $82 billion—based on spending over recent years. By then  support the EU has already approved for Kyiv will be running out and fiscal constraints in many European capitals make leaders wary about asking taxpayers for more.(Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...TOPICS:Business/EconomyCulture/SocietyEuropean UnionForeign AffairsRussiaUkraineKEYWORDS:bidenboykeywordtrollbidenistatrollfarmbidenswartardsonfreuropeeuropeansuicideeuropeanunionhungarykeywordfagslaurencenormanletsyoutakehismoneyliberalismistheftnotourwarlibtardspoootleromgomgproxywarputinthewarpigrussiarussiankeywordtrollrussiansuicideslovakiaswampniks4bidenswartrumpswarukrainevictorythroughtheftvladtheimplodervlodthepianowankerwallstreetjournalwelfarewarzeepersorgasmiczeepersoverjoyedzeepersthrilledClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.To: denniswThat old quiz show called “Win Ben Stein’s Money” ........

""The EU and its allies have demanded that Russia pay reparations to Ukraine for the war's damage  though they acknowledge that the Kremlin is unlikely to agree to do so. The notion of confiscating the assets created fears that foreign investors would reduce investments in eurozone assets and worries about setting precedents."" MO< But  ""...EU leaders agreed to keep working on a plan to put hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian cash to use—without Kyiv ever needing to repay a cent."" So  1) Russia has to lose the war and lose it decisively enough to back it into paying reparations to Ukraine. 2) Ukraine has to win decisively enough  to make this obvious. Oddly though  in this time Europe is still buying Russia energy and other products  as President Trump mentioned openly. Trump tells European leaders that buying Russian oil is helping Moscow fund war against Ukraine Independent UK  5 September 2025 E.U. delays new Russia sanctions as Trump demands end to oil purchases Washington Post  17 September 2025 Trump demands NATO allies halt Russian oil purchases before new US sanctions FOX  15 September 2025 How quickly the news cycle ""forgets."" How quickly the news cycle ""forgets."" Moreover  Europe and the US continue to buy Russian products  in spite of all the very public sanctions"" ""Last year  the U.S. imported about $1.27 billion in Russian fertilizers  slightly more than the $1.14 billion in 2021. The U.S. also imported enriched uranium and plutonium from Russia worth about $624 million in 2024  compared to $646 million in 2021. Russia also exported palladium to the U.S. worth about $878 million in 2024  compared to $1.59 billion in 2021."" What Russian goods the U.S. and EU continue to import despite war in Ukraine New Voice of Ukraine  via MSN  15 September 2025 ""Mainly  nitrogen fertilizer supplies increased – by a quarter  to $66.4 million. Purchases of potash fertilizers also increased – by almost 5%  to $18.5 million in January. The US almost did not buy mixed fertilizers – it is about $613 thousand tons against 568 thousand tons previously. ""The main buyers of Russian fertilizers were China  Brazil and India."" US companies increased fertilizer purchases from Russia by 20% Ukrainian Shipping Magazine  12 March 2025 ""This result allowed exporters from Russia to take second place in Top of the leading suppliers. Canada came in first place with $325.1 million  and Saudi Arabia came in third. Compared to February 2025  shipments to the United States doubled  and compared to March 2024 - by 25%. We are talking about shipments of urea and potassium chloride."" The states are buying up massively produced in Russian fertilizers EAD  7 May 2025 The whole looks far more complex than the headlines and media and public pronouncements would have us believe.The whole looks far more complex than the headlines and media and public pronouncements would have us believe.To: denniswBank robber?

Even Birgitte Nyborg would struggle to keep up,Danish police snipers on Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen during a meeting of EU leaders on Wednesday. Photograph: Emil Helms/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty ImagesThe behind-the-scenes preparations for the meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen would have made a fitting episode of the Danish political drama Borgen  which follows the struggles of fictional prime minister Birgitte Nyborg.Mysterious drones appeared and shut down the capital airport  then other airports  causing huge disruption. More drones were spotted near military sites in the week before Denmark was to host back-to-back high-level summits  something that is a major logistical undertaking in isolation.Russia was blamed as the likely culprit  though investigating authorities have not publicly said they have been able to confirm whether the Kremlin or its allies were the source of the interference.It was Christiansborg Palace  a location familiar to fans of the Borgen series  where the actual Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen welcomed the other 26 EU leaders for a summit on Wednesday. Known as the “castle”  or borgen in Danish  Christiansborg houses the prime minister’s office  the parliament and supreme court.As often is the case when EU leaders gather these days  the war in Ukraine and Europe’s belated plans to up the amount it spends on its own defence dominated the agenda.A new plan was tabled  controversial or clever depending on who you ask  that could see a whopping €140 billion loan extended to Ukraine. It would be funded by a huge pile of Russian money that Vladimir Putin can’t get his hands on  because it’s sitting in a clearing house account in Belgium.Sweeping economic sanctions in the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine froze Russian assets that were inside the EU at the time  worth hundreds of billions of euros. The assets  mostly Russian central bank bonds  have been kept on ice since then in Euroclear  a Brussels-based central securities depository.The EU previously used the profits that mountain of assets was accumulating to finance a big part of a $50 billion (€43 billion) loan to Kyiv.Now some leaders want to go further  effectively tapping the frozen assets themselves  which have mostly matured from bonds to cash.US president Donald Trump has begun pulling back his country’s financial support for Kyiv  leaving what could become a huge financial hole. EU capitals are baulking at the thought of having to fill it from their own budgets.Ukraine remains under an intense barrage from Russian drone and missile attacks. On the ground  its forces are tired. Kyiv will be increasingly looking to lean on its European allies. The prospect of any quick truce brokered by Trump has faded for now.It is estimated Ukraine will need an extra €130 billion over 2026 and 2027. There will be a real financial pinch expected in the second half of next year.The European Central Bank has been hostile to any talk of the EU permanently seizing the frozen Russian assets  as that would fall foul of international law.The European Commission  the EU’s executive branch  circulated an internal paper to diplomats last week  sketching out a possible workaround. A convoluted loan structure would be set up to replace the frozen assets with an IOU. The paper said Russia would be repaid only when it had compensated Ukraine for the destruction Putin’s war had caused.There are still a lot of open questions about the proposal. “This is a very complex issue with a lot of financial and legal implications ” one senior EU official said. No decision was expected to be taken at the Copenhagen summit.The Belgian government has been fiercely opposed to calls to touch the assets. It is nervous it will be left on the hook in the event of any legal challenge  given it is the country holding the frozen Russian cash. They also feel the assets are an important bargaining chip in Europe’s hand  in any future peace negotiations between Kyiv  Moscow and possibly the US.Belgium will probably only come on board if there are rock-solid assurances any risk from all of this is borne by the EU as a whole. That is a tall bar to clear. It probably won’t even be the trickiest bit either.The EU would have to change how it renews its regime of economic sanctions on Russia  something it has tried and failed to do before.At the moment  the sanctions blacklisting Russia economically need to be rolled over every six months  by unanimous approval.The jumbo loan to Ukraine would need those rules to be changed  to only require a weighted majority of the EU’s 27 states supporting the sanctions staying in place.This removes the risk that a rogue leader  such as Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orban or Slovakia’s populist leader Robert Fico  could block their renewal  triggering a legal and financial crisis over the status of the Russian assets.The problem is removing national vetoes in this case and moving to majority voting rules would  itself  probably need unanimous agreement. Orban is  by nature  a transactional politician who regularly tries to extract concessions elsewhere by threatening to block the sanctions rollover. He won’t give that valuable leverage up for nothing.,neutral,0.02,0.62,0.36,mixed,0.04,0.21,0.75,True,English,"['frozen billions', 'Hungarian villain', 'Scandi-noir summit', 'Drones', 'Copenhagen', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Brussels-based central securities depository', 'actual Danish prime minister', 'The European Central Bank', 'one senior EU official', 'Danish political drama Borgen', 'Russian central bank bonds', 'US president Donald Trump', 'fictional prime minister', 'Danish police snipers', 'major logistical undertaking', 'clearing house account', 'important bargaining chip', 'future peace negotiations', 'The European Commission', 'convoluted loan structure', 'real financial pinch', 'huge financial hole', 'whopping €140 billion loan', 'majority voting rules', 'frozen Russian cash', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other 26 EU leaders', 'European leaders', 'Russian money', 'Russian drone', 'other airports', 'billion) loan', 'jumbo loan', 'weighted majority', 'huge disruption', 'Borgen series', 'huge pile', 'European allies', 'frozen assets', 'financial support', 'financial crisis', 'Emil Helms', 'Ritzau Scanpix/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'scenes preparations', 'fitting episode', 'Birgitte Nyborg', 'Mysterious drones', 'capital airport', 'More drones', 'military sites', 'high-level summits', 'investigating authorities', 'Mette Frederiksen', 'supreme court', 'new plan', 'early weeks', 'full-scale invasion', 'big part', 'intense barrage', 'missile attacks', 'quick truce', 'second half', 'next year', 'international law', 'executive branch', 'possible workaround', 'open questions', 'complex issue', 'Belgian government', 'rock-solid assurances', 'tall bar', 'trickiest bit', 'unanimous approval', 'rogue leader', 'populist leader', 'Robert Fico', 'national vetoes', 'unanimous agreement', 'transactional politician', 'EU capitals', 'Christiansborg Palace', 'legal implications', 'legal challenge', 'Vladimir Putin', 'economic sanctions', 'internal paper', 'Copenhagen summit', '$50 billion', 'meeting', 'Wednesday', 'Photograph', 'struggles', 'Denmark', 'something', 'isolation', 'culprit', 'Kremlin', 'source', 'interference', 'location', 'fans', 'castle', 'office', 'parliament', 'case', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'plans', 'amount', 'defence', 'agenda', 'hands', 'Belgium', 'time', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'euros', 'Euroclear', 'profits', 'mountain', 'Kyiv.', 'country', 'thought', 'budgets', 'ground', 'forces', 'prospect', 'talk', 'foul', 'diplomats', 'destruction', 'lot', 'proposal', 'decision', 'calls', 'hook', 'event', 'Moscow', 'board', 'risk', 'regime', 'moment', '27 states', 'place', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'renewal', 'status', 'problem', 'nature']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,irishtimes.com

In recent years  both the Greek Police services and  more importantly  the Anti–Money Laundering Authority and the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) have admittedly “caught” many such or similar cases. In these cases  we often hear — because they are included in the official reports of the Authorities and sent to the prosecutor — various well-known names: artists  celebrities  football figures  and so on. The problem is that in Greece  “miracles” seem to last only a few days  just long enough to make media noise. Afterwards  everything is forgotten  and the main figures in these major fraud cases walk away unscathed (or almost unscathed) and carry on with their lives — often repeating the same or very similar financial crimes. It’s as if some “invisible hand” intervenes and magically erases or neatly covers everything up. So I want to ask publicly: who is this “invisible hand” that ultimately untangles all the messes for the country’s pseudo-celebrities  even if they’re being pursued by [Minister] Chrysochoidis  [prosecutor] Vourliotis  or [AADE head] Pitsilis? Is it one person  or a combination of entanglement  corruption  and public relations?Kövesi – A Surprise VisitYesterday  European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi was in Athens  where she met with Ministers Pierrakakis  Chrysochoidis  and Floridis. I spoke with all my sources  and they all told me almost exactly the same thing — with minor variations — about her meetings with the Greek ministers. Kövesi made an excellent impression: she is entirely institutional  and her focus is on cases of major significance for the European Union. The sole topic of her discussions was Operation “Calypso” — the discovery of 2 500 illegal containers at Piraeus’ 3rd Customs Office. These Chinese containers were found at the port  and if they had slipped through  the EU would have lost around €800 million in revenues (according to the Financial Times). Detecting them was  therefore  a major success for her office. That’s why Kövesi came to Athens — for customs matters. She will give a press conference there today  regardless of whether she is asked about OPEKEPE (the Greek agricultural payments organization) or the “717” (the Tempi train disaster). She received everything she asked from Pierrakakis to increase customs inspections  and her overall stance and demeanor made it clear that she is there to do her job  not politics. Chrysochoidis was ready to brief her on the Economic Police’s investigation into OPEKEPE  but that wasn’t necessary. Regarding the discussion on amending Article 86 of the Constitution  Kövesi brought up the matter following an intervention by Greek European Prosecutor Nikos Paschalis  and Floridis explained the parliamentary procedure based on commitments made by [Prime Minister] K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis). That’s what my sources told me  and I’m passing it on.Behind the Scenes with MylonakisThe letter sent by Giorgos Mylonakis to the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee on OPEKEPE  requesting to be called as a witness  was a kind of “dribble” move by the deputy minister — after opposition parties and various MPs (notably Voultsepsi  who has a history with Mylonakis) demanded his presence. Mylonakis claims he has no involvement in the substance of the case and has already responded to all allegations during two previous parliamentary question sessions — but says he’s willing to repeat himself if MPs wish. In reality  it would have been awkward if everyone else called for his testimony while he avoided attending. The scheduling of his appearance will be decided by the Committee’s Presidium  but other witnesses such as agency heads and ministers will take precedence.Storm over the Frigate“They say ‘a small village  few houses ’” and in SYRIZA’s case  this applies perfectly. There’s now a storm brewing over whether the party will vote in favor of the fourth Belharra frigate. Karameros publicly stated that the party should support it  and several officials and MPs share this view. Even Famelos is said to lean toward voting in favor. However  the other half of the president’s close associates and MPs (including Zachariadis  Polakis  and others) disagree  arguing that such a vote is inconsistent with their stance on prioritizing social spending. Interestingly  New Left is also opposed to the frigate purchase  at a time when the flirtation between the parties is intensifying.PASOK and the Empty Square…“At most three and a cuckoo” — well  okay  there were a few more — gathered yesterday at 11 a.m. in Klafthmonos Square after party president Nikos A. issued a call. SMS messages and phone calls had gone out from Harilaou Trikoupi (PASOK HQ) to inform party officials  MPs  and members about the planned attendance at the GSEE–ADEDY strike rally  but the mobilization flopped. Only a few MPs showed up — after all  Parliament is just steps away — along with some green trade unionists  party officials  and the president’s close aides. After delivering his fighting statement  our leader quietly left.Paulson  UBS  and the 15% ScenariosNow to market news — and a quick pause to mention that the Dark Room column celebrates its 5th anniversary on newmoney.gr this October. To mark the occasion  here’s a report on the banking sector. While no immediate developments are expected  the market is “boiling”. John Paulson has now been a shareholder in Piraeus Bank for over a decade. Recently  he completely sold his stake in Alpha Bank  and also reduced his Piraeus stake slightly to just below 15%. This leaves him with a strategic 15% holding — essentially a “key” stake for any potential buyer to control the bank. The former hedge fund manager  who also took a “hit” on his investment in EYDAP (Athens Water)  would have no problem cashing out and leaving. UBS and Stefanos Papapanagiotou have taken on the task of finding a buyer. It’s not clear whether UBS has been formally mandated  or whether Papapanagiotou is handling it informally until the right conditions arise to propose a deal. Papapanagiotou  who has climbed the UBS hierarchy  has connections in the European banking system and may well find a suitable buyer — especially at a time favorable to cross-border bank mergers.When Goldman Sachs Went to P. Mylonas’ OfficeThe market’s antennas may not pick up on these kinds of behind-the-scenes developments  but that’s not the case for Goldman Sachs  which  observing the situation  saw an opportunity. Relations between P. Mylonas (CEO of National Bank of Greece) and Ch. Megalou (CEO of Piraeus Bank) were strained because of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance). The two banks will eventually reach an agreement on the bancassurance deal  because a grotesque Gordian knot has formed that it is in both their interests to resolve — and the sooner  the better. However  this doesn’t mean that the management of National Bank has digested the sale of Ethniki Asfalistiki — a transaction for which  once again  Piraeus Bank used UBS and Papapanagiotou’s services. In fact  market talk says that Mylonas was so upset at first that he refused to take Megalou’s calls  as the latter tried to explain and smooth things over. Goldman Sachs  seeing this “pleasant” atmosphere  visited P. Mylonas and proposed that National Bank acquire Paulson’s shares in Piraeus Bank. The plan had been studied seriously and in depth: National had more than enough capital for such a move  the idea was well liked  but then the “invisible hand” Adam Smith wrote about stepped in and hit the pause button. Indeed  such a merger would have placed a Greek bank among the top 50 in Europe  but for it to make sense  many branches would have had to close  many employees laid off  and competition issues addressed. The latter would have been solved by selling off assets of both National and Piraeus  giving other banks a chance to buy and thus reshaping market balances. Was the plan abandoned? “Not entirely ” says a reliable source. The column adds that the plan remains on the table  as a kind of “battle plan” for the right moment  if and when it arises. P.S.1: All of the above is  of course  officially denied. P.S.2: This behind-the-scenes scenario could potentially push up Piraeus Bank’s share price  because if its valuation rises  all these plans become uneconomical.Why the Belgians Want EurobankMeanwhile  another situation is unfolding. The Ministry of Economy has its eyes on KBC and the acquisition attempt the Belgian bank is making in the Dutch market. If this move into the Netherlands doesn’t go through  Greece should be ready to welcome the Belgians. Their first target is Eurobank  and the second is Piraeus Bank. They prefer Eurobank because KBC already has a subsidiary in Bulgaria. By acquiring Eurobank  they would create the largest bank in Bulgaria  while simultaneously gaining a presence in Greece and Cyprus. The question is whether Prem Watsa  after so many years on Eurobank’s shareholder register  would enter negotiations to sell  for example  10% now and gradually the remaining 20% over time. He runs an insurance group  has held the investment for ten years — we shall see…The Hint from Theodorikakos to SupermarketsThere were three key moments in yesterday’s meeting between Development Minister T. Theodorikakos and supermarket representatives  regarding the initiative to reduce prices on 1 000 basic goods. The first two involved the negotiations themselves. The most important outcome was that supermarkets agreed to discounts of over 5% on packaged products. The second key point was the agreement to apply the measure until the end of the year  with the minister pushing for it to continue into 2026. The third and most interesting moment came when Theodorikakos told the business representatives not to confuse this discussion with the fines imposed by DIMEA (the market enforcement agency)  because he is legally obligated to impose them — otherwise  he would be committing a dereliction of duty. I assume the supermarket representatives caught the hint.October 6 and 9: Key Dates for Intralot…The capital increase (AMK) of Intralot with cash contributions continues and will be completed next Friday  through a combined domestic and international offering  with a maximum offer price of €1.27 in both order books. The capital increase is already considered fully covered  and the company is expected to raise around €400 million from foreign (€316 million) and Greek (€84 million) investors. Of this  €300 million will go toward acquiring Bally’s Interactive  and €90 million toward repaying existing debt. On Monday  October 6  the final offer price will be announced. On Thursday  October 9  the new shares will begin trading on the Athens Stock Exchange. This AMK is the final stage of the deal to create the new Intralot–Bally’s group  following the €900 million bond issue earlier this year  which attracted €3.3 billion in offers from more than 200 investment portfolios. From that point onward  the journey of the “new Intralot” begins. Together with Bally’s Interactive  it will form a group where online gaming accounts for about 70% of revenues  with the UK as its main market. Based on 2024 figures  the new structure represents revenues of over €1.1 billion and EBITDA of €410–420 million.…and the Thousands of Derivatives ContractsAnd since we’ve opened the Intralot chapter  it’s worth mentioning that yesterday at noon there were more than 399 000 Futures contracts on the Derivatives Exchange for Intralot’s share — all at a premium  i.e.  above the €1.27 maximum offering price for the capital increase. Each contract corresponds to 100 shares  meaning there’s a “volume” for future transactions of 40 million shares. Yesterday’s 2.36% rise in the share price to €1.30 indicates comfortable oversubscription of the capital increase by Friday. The same happened with the special bond issues  which attracted €3 billion in demand  with €850 million ultimately raised. All this shows that the moves are well planned and executed. Of course  everything will become clear on Friday — unless the sky falls on our heads…The Acquisition of Algosystems by Profile and the Olayan TiesFollowing yesterday’s column report  Profile was obliged to announce to the Stock Exchange that it is in advanced negotiations to acquire at least 85% of Algosystems  aiming to expand its activities in the cybersecurity sector. This is a significant  though not large  acquisition for the Greek IT market.Algosystems has a very interesting history. It was founded in 1986. Akram Sayioun led the company for 22 years  and in 2020 he became Chairman of the Board  handing over management to his children  Alexandros and Tamara Sayioun. Until 2016  the largest shareholding in Algosystems belonged to the Olayan Investment Co. group  but the company retained a family character  with many executives working there for over 15 years. The Olayan Group is the well-known business group founded in 1947 by Suliman Saleh Olayan  one of the wealthiest Saudi businessmen. After his death in 2002  his son Khaled took over as chairman of the group  while his three daughters also assumed significant roles. Lubna Olayan was one of the first women of Saudi origin to take on leadership positions in the private sector. Today  the Olayan Group is a multinational company headquartered in Liechtenstein  with offices in New York  London  Luxembourg  Athens  Singapore  and more. The Greek office of Olayan Investments Company Establishment is housed in a distinctive domed building on Poseidonos Avenue in Glyfada. In January 2024  Andreas Doumouros was appointed CEO of Algosystems. He has worked at the company since 1989 as Technical Director  following an 11-year career at OTE.Response to Giannitsis’ CriticismYesterday  the European Commission appointed ELSTAT President Thanasis Thanopoulos as Deputy Director-General of Eurostat (DG ESTAT). The news carries dual significance: political  as it serves as a practical response to recent criticism by former minister Tasos Giannitsis — who questioned the method of GDP calculation in his articles — and professional (for some at least)  as the position of ELSTAT President is now open.The Vietnamese in Greece for Business and Shipping…A 20-member government delegation from Vietnam  led by the Vice President of Parliament  is visiting Greece from October 2. The goal is to hold meetings with the Greek government and business circles.From a shipping perspective  Vietnam is developing its shipbuilding industry  focusing initially on ship repairs rather than newbuilds. Branches of major Eastern shipyards have opened there and are winning contracts. The link between the two countries is the honorary consul in Greece  shipowner Gavriil Petritis  who is hosting a luncheon for them today at the Flisvos Marina. “They’re interested in maintaining good relations with Greece and its shipping sector ” diplomatic circles said  adding that their mission is challenging because the Vietnamese are cautious and hesitant in their actions — a stance that limits their flexibility. Regarding their shipyards  some are reportedly neglected  but foreign investors are arriving to renovate them. Shipping executives mention that the problem is that the Vietnamese cannot provide refund guarantees  nor can they build new ships  which is why they focus on repair visitors.…And the Germans Follow Closely BehindA different group is expected to arrive in Piraeus in mid-October: eleven German maritime technology companies participating in a business mission under the auspices of the German Ministry of Economy and Energy (BMWE). What’s interesting is that the Germans are not coming only to showcase their know-how but also to see firsthand how they can “fit” into Greek shipping. The scheduled B2B meetings show that matchmaking is at the core. They will bring with them “green” propulsion systems and energy-saving solutions  as well as digital applications for ships  shipyards  and ports.Cosmote’s SurpriseNext Monday  Cosmote has invited press representatives to a “Magenta Presentation.” It’s no longer a secret that Kostas Nebis will present for the first time the T-Phone  the new T-Mobile phone that  among other features  will leverage Artificial Intelligence in collaboration with Perplexity. We have entered the era in which telecommunications companies are evolving into TELCO–TECH firms  offering a combination of telecommunications and high-tech services enriched with AI. Expectations for these new services have pushed OTE’s market capitalization back above €6.5 billion.The Proposal for Electric Car Leasing and the Listed CompaniesIt’s an idea that has worked well in France. The Ministry of Transport has submitted a request to the European Social and Climate Fund. If all goes well  funding will arrive by 2026. The idea is to allow young workers and low-income professionals to acquire an electric car for commuting  at a very low monthly lease cost of €50–100. If approved  around 11 000 electric vehicles will be included in the program  with the state subsidizing most of the monthly lease cost. An initial budget of €450 million has been drafted (€150 million for private individuals  €300 million for professionals)  but all of this depends on approval by the Social and Climate Fund. This has sparked major discussions on the Stock Exchange about which companies will benefit  with Auto Hellas (Eft. Vassilakis) and Motodynamics (Paris Kyriakopoulos) seen as prime candidates. In any case  11 000 electric vehicles represent a significant market opportunity.The First Attempt at a Trend Shift in the MarketThe Athens General Index started October “on the right foot ” aiming to achieve a 12th consecutive month of gains — something that has never happened before. The market has been in a consolidation phase for weeks  but yesterday’s first session after the nine-month period gave some signs of a trend shift: along with the rise  there was a satisfactory trading volume. The session began cautiously amid uncertainty  with the General Index slipping to 2 025.95 points (-0.41%) early on. By midday  the banks led a rally  pushing the Index up to 2 057.78 points (+1.16%)  before closing at 2 056.38 points  up 1.09% for the day. Trading volume reached €220.5 million  including €30.1 million in pre-arranged transactions. Trades in Piraeus  Alpha  and Eurobank shares accounted for about half of the day’s total transactions. Piraeus (+3.27% to €7.45)  National Bank (+3.48% to €12.79)  Eurobank (+2.29% to €3.35)  and Alpha (+1.47% to €3.66) led the way  followed by Cenergy (+2.79% to €12.54) and PPC (+2.71% to €14.40). Coca-Cola lost the €40 support level (-0.75% to €39.76). Hellenic Exchanges continued its mild decline (-0.6% to €6.6)  awaiting news about its engagement with Euronext. Mevaco  after an unforgettable +21.9% the previous day  closed with +3.59% at €8.65. The session also brought a negative record: Austriacard Holdings fell below €5 for the first time since January 2023  when it began dual listing in Athens and Vienna.Paris Dragnis and the StatueThe statue of the mythical Jason will be inaugurated on Saturday  November 1  2025  at the central pier of the Port of Volos. Shipowner Paris Dragnis  originally from Volos  is the sponsor  though he had wished to remain anonymous until now. A platform of approximately 182 m² (perimeter 54 m) has been constructed to host and highlight the sculpture. Its placement is symbolic  as this is the spot where  according to mythology  the Argo docked. This statue follows the announcement a year ago of the creation of the Dragnis Foundation’s cultural center  which will host educational and social initiatives.New Head of Communications at JTI HellasJTI (Japan Tobacco International) Hellas is the Greek subsidiary of the global JTI Group  one of the largest tobacco companies in the world. In Greece  the company is active in the import  distribution  and marketing of tobacco products (traditional cigarettes and alternative nicotine products). As of yesterday  Dr. Simos Sidiropoulos has taken on the role of Director of Corporate Affairs and Communications at JTI Hellas  with responsibilities spanning Greece  Cyprus  and Malta. Sidiropoulos  in his forties and with academic experience  joined JTI Hellas in 2022 and has since been active in the Greek market  serving as Corporate Relations and Communications Manager.Luxury Hotels Are Thriving — Budget Ones Are StrugglingA Bank of America study reveals a striking moment in the global hospitality industry: luxury is booming  while budget destinations are suffering. Worldwide  luxury hotels are breaking occupancy records  while budget hotel chains are struggling to keep the lights on. BofA describes the situation as a “K-shaped recovery ” where economic fortunes diverge sharply. The data is telling: spending on accommodation by low-income consumers has fallen by 2% since 2023  even as overall consumer spending has increased by 1%. This means that while some are spending more  others are drastically cutting back. The “legends” of budget hotels — such as Choice Hotels  Wyndham  and Spirit Realty — once considered “safe havens” during recessions  are now on the sidelines. The irony? What was once considered “cheap sleep” is now proving very expensive for investors. On the other hand  luxury brands are flourishing. Accor saw a +18% increase in luxury room sales in the first quarter  while Hilton is planning to sextuple its stock of high-end accommodations. Wealthy consumers are not just traveling — they’re investing in experiences  comfort  and premium services. This trend is also evident in Greece  where luxury boutique hotels and five-star resorts are filling up  while budget accommodations face increased competition and squeezed profit margins. Behind these numbers may lie a broader economic truth: the middle class is shrinking  and consumer behavior is polarizing. Businesses that target the “golden middle” or budget segments risk finding themselves in a “dead zone” in the market. The old formula — “low prices for the mass market” — no longer works in a world where that mass market simply doesn’t have the money.,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,mixed,0.23,0.19,0.58,True,English,"['Invisible Hand', 'fake invoices', 'ministers’ surprise', 'Kövesi', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Paulson', 'UBS', 'Mylonas', 'Belgians', 'Eurobank', 'two previous parliamentary question sessions', 'Greek European Prosecutor Nikos Paschalis', 'GSEE–ADEDY strike rally', 'Greek agricultural payments organization', 'Anti–Money Laundering Authority', 'Piraeus’ 3rd Customs Office', 'European Chief Prosecutor', 'Tempi train disaster', 'Greek Police services', 'Parliamentary Inquiry Committee', 'similar financial crimes', 'fourth Belharra frigate', 'Laura Kövesi', 'major fraud cases', 'European Union', 'parliamentary procedure', 'Greek FBI', 'Independent Authority', 'Nikos A.', 'Greek ministers', 'customs matters', 'customs inspections', 'Financial Times', 'Economic Police', 'similar cases', 'major significance', 'K.M.', 'fake invoices', 'other words', 'public funds', 'recent years', 'Public Revenue', 'official reports', 'known names', 'football figures', 'media noise', 'main figures', 'invisible hand', 'one person', 'public relations', 'Surprise Visit', 'minor variations', 'excellent impression', 'sole topic', 'Operation “Calypso', '2,500 illegal containers', 'Chinese containers', 'press conference', 'Kyriakos Mitsotakis', 'dribble” move', 'deputy minister', 'other witnesses', 'agency heads', 'small village', 'several officials', 'Even Famelos', 'other half', 'close associates', 'social spending', 'New Left', 'frigate purchase', 'Empty Square', 'Klafthmonos Square', 'SMS messages', 'phone calls', 'Harilaou Trikoupi', 'major success', 'various schemers', 'major case', 'same thing', 'overall stance', 'opposition parties', 'PASOK HQ', 'party officials', 'Minister] Chrysochoidis', 'Giorgos Mylonakis', 'Ministers Pierrakakis', 'party president', 'various MPs', '11 a', 'Newsroom', 'forged', 'VAT', 'AADE', 'many', 'Authorities', 'artists', 'celebrities', 'problem', 'Greece', 'miracles', 'everything', 'lives', 'messes', 'country', 'Vourliotis', 'Pitsilis', 'combination', 'entanglement', 'corruption', 'Athens', 'Floridis', 'sources', 'meetings', 'focus', 'discussions', 'discovery', 'revenues', 'OPEKEPE', 'demeanor', 'job', 'politics', 'investigation', 'Article', 'Constitution', 'intervention', 'commitments', 'Scenes', 'letter', 'kind', 'Voultsepsi', 'history', 'presence', 'involvement', 'substance', 'allegations', 'reality', 'everyone', 'testimony', 'scheduling', 'appearance', 'Presidium', 'precedence', 'Storm', 'houses', 'SYRIZA', 'favor', 'Karameros', 'view', 'Zachariadis', 'Polakis', 'others', 'vote', 'flirtation', 'cuckoo', 'members', 'attendance', 'mobilization', '717']",2025-10-02,2025-10-03,en.protothema.gr
