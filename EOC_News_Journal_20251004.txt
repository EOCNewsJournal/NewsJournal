Money managers  too  are bearish  as market participants have been holding net short positions throughout 2024 and 2025 in the year-to-date.Price forecastResearch agency BMI  a unit of Fitch Solutions  said: “We are making a downward revision to our wheat price forecast for 2025 from $5.68/bushel to $5.46  driven by improved expectations for harvests in the largest producing markets. ICE-listed soft-red winter second-month futures closed the latest session on September 22 at $5.295  equivalent to an 11.9 per cent year-on-year decrease and 5 per cent lower than the first closing price of 2025.”The average monthly price for August was $5.298  4.5 per cent lower than the average monthly price for July and the lowest monthly average since September 2024  it saidSmaller Argentine cropThe USDA said global wheat production in 2025-26 is forecast up at a record 816.2 mt. Australia’s production has been raised with larger yield and area harvested.“The European Union (EU) (production) is raised to a 10-year high  partly driven by updated government statistics. Larger yields are forecast for Germany  Romania  and Bulgaria. Russia is forecast to have a larger production of both winter and spring wheat ” said the USDA.Yields in Canada  Kazakhstan and Ukraine are forecast to be higher this season  while Argentina may have a smaller crop.Money managers shortBMI said the latest reading from September 16 pointed to a net short position of 85 825  slightly lower than the 2025 average of 87 591. “However  a reading that indicates continued expectations for muted prices. On this  we highlight that the continued net short market positioning increases the risk of short covering and short-term upward price movements ” it said.The International Grains Council (IGC) said total grains production is forecast to rise by 87 mt in the 2025-26 season (July-June)  to record high of 2 412 mt  with increases for all crops  barring rye.“Uptake is also predicted to climb to a fresh record  up by 50 mt to 2 395 mt  including gains for food  feed and industrial uses.

As I wrote yesterday  Kövesi was fully institutional in everything during her visits to ministers Floridis  Chrysochoidis  and Pierrakakis. And naturally  when asked about other corruption issues beyond her main focus — smuggling and tax evasion at the Port of Piraeus — she spoke out directly and boldly  to a degree. She also touched on OPEKEPE  the 717 case  and the recycling huts  clarifying of course that “grabs” of European funds don’t happen only in Greece  but everywhere.Now  on the law about ministerial responsibility  truth be told  she was a bit more blunt than judges usually are when speaking about legislative matters  but come on — the woman is a judge. She tends to speak a bit more heavily — so what? Marinakis’ spokesperson was asked about it too  and after saying everyone is entitled to their opinion (meaning Ms. Kövesi too)… he simply clarified that the Constitution changes when Parliament decides so  and of course  when that Parliament is a revising one. In other words  the conversation will begin in 2026 and conclude after the national elections. Still  it would be good for all parties to take this opportunity to tell us their stance. That is  how they believe Article 86 on ministerial responsibility should be abolished. In other words  what happens when a citizen or even the judiciary wants to press charges against a minister — will there be filters and safeguards like in other countries  etc.? Because we’ve been hearing this for decades  and we’ve had right-wing governments  PASOK  SYRIZA  coalition governments… and still  the pancake’s never flipped. It’s time to hear the what and how.DendiasSo yesterday  Dendias took yet another small step in his now-obvious plan to subtly (but surely) set himself apart… tiptoeing across various popular (or populist) issues to boost his profile. Yesterday was his turn to say that we all sympathize with the hunger striker Ruci and that for such a sensitive matter  he can’t imagine telling a father not to investigate what he deems necessary regarding his child’s death  etc. As if Dendias  a distinguished lawyer  doesn’t know exactly what’s going on in this case and what’s behind it. Anyway  when it became an issue in Parliament and Famellos called him out for diverging from the government  he “clarified” that it’s not a government matter but one of the judiciary. He must’ve heard something  clearly…Adonis–DendiasStill  the P.M. is “playing” Count Nikos pretty well these days — Mitsotakis praised him for the bill he presented at the Cabinet  and even during his speech in Copenhagen  he mentioned ELCAC  which was founded under Dendias at the Pentagon and deals with defense innovation. But among all the sudden praise for Dendias  the one from Adonis stood out — considering they’ve exchanged barbs over time. In two interviews (Eugenidis on Protothema and Portosalte on SKAI)  Adonis praised Dendias’ bill as a key reform in the Armed Forces and said he respects any minister who takes on political cost to break eggs. A fine winter is coming  as I’ve said before.Decisions and announcements on industrial electricity ratesAnother meeting was held yesterday at the Deputy Prime Minister’s office under Hatzidakis  as a follow-up to the one at Maximos Mansion with SEV about energy-intensive industries and electricity costs. From the government  Pierrakakis  Papastavrou  Theodorikakos  Tsafos  and Petralias attended; from SEV  Spyros Theodoropoulos and SVE president Loukia Saranti. From what I gather  decisions have now moved to the P.M. level  who will have the relevant discussion with Hatzidakis soon (possibly even today)  since on Tuesday the Prime Minister will be the keynote speaker at SEV’s General Assembly at the Athens Concert Hall. Announcements may also come then.Cretan. Hydra–SpetsesI heard that the Cretan (the supermarket chain) has backed out of that massive property they had leased to build an equally massive supermarket in Spetses  right next to the Anargyros mansion (national benefactor and founder of the Anargyreios & Korgialeneios School)  which is now about to be renovated. Let’s hope they also vacate similar properties in Hydra. So many shops are for rent on the islands  my friend — just step a little further in and wrap it up…Skeleton Operation  Kimberly  and the shutdownJust as Kimberly Guilfoyle’s appointment to the U.S. Embassy in Greece was approved  the U.S. government shutdown came along to freeze everything  as the budget wasn’t passed by the Democrats. Six votes are missing for it to go through  and now the matter is dragging on day by day.Word from the embassy is that Kimberly’s arrival will be delayed a bit more. For now  the embassy is operating with essential staff only — a “Skeleton Operation ” as they call it. When asked how long the shutdown might last  diplomatic sources monitoring the embassy in Athens said that in the last 15 years  it’s happened three times. In 2018 it lasted over a month  and the other two times  up to a week.Indians from Hinduja Bank looking at GreeceAnother investor looking into investing in Greece emerged from a conversation at the Athens Riviera Forum between the CEO of the HCAP  Giannis Papachristou  and Karam Hinduja  CEO of Hinduja Bank. The bank is based in Switzerland  but it’s controlled by the multinational Hinduja Group  which belongs to one of the richest families in India. It operates across multiple sectors (IT  energy  real estate  finance  automotive  etc.) and manages assets worth around $22 billion.During the discussion — which also included Ahmad AlSawalhi  a senior executive from UAE’s MGX fund — Karam Hinduja said he’s seriously considering investing in Greece. In recent years  Hinduja Bank has strengthened its activity in innovation and tech  tapping into the major growth opportunities globally.Negotiations with Euronext and the role of the Athens Stock Exchange in the allianceThe talks currently taking place between the Euronext leadership and the Athens Stock Exchange aren’t so much about the acquisition price  but rather about the future role HELEX will play in the post-acquisition era. The Italian Stock Exchange negotiated hard — brokers there even went on a three-day strike — and they ended up taking over clearing of Euronext trades. The Portuguese secured the tech infrastructure and IT development in Lisbon. Oslo claimed and got Energy. So what role will Athens play in this new stock exchange alliance? Is the “gateway to the Balkans and Eastern Europe” role enough? The public offer for 67% — regardless of price — is not as significant mid-term as the effort to avoid the marginalization of the Greek capital market. After all  the law allows the public offer target to shift — for example  instead of 67% of HELEX shares  they could aim for 50%  or even just a blocking minority of 33% at first.Derivatives and Intralot’s capital increaseYesterday we wrote about the thousands of premium-priced futures contracts opened recently on Intralot stock at the Derivatives Exchange. The €400 million capital increase has become a playground for sophisticated arbitrage strategies  centered around the Athens Derivatives Market. Intralot’s management announced yesterday that orders placed by institutional investors exceed the available shares  in a range from €1.07 to €1.12. Tens of thousands of futures contracts are being traded at premium prices  creating a complex speculation puzzle. The bet is simple in theory  tricky in practice: investors open short positions in the futures  locking in profits at today’s levels. At the same time  they hope to join the capital increase at €1.12  buying cheaper and closing their short positions at a profit. But if demand is really as strong as claimed  many might be left out of the increase or get far fewer shares at €1.12 than they hoped. Allocations in oversubscribed issues often disappoint. Those who bet on this strategy might end up with open short positions and no new shares to cover them — forced to buy from the market at any price. All of this points to a very interesting trading session on October 9  when the new shares will start trading. Yesterday  Intralot stock dropped -3.85% to €1.25.Greek shipowners: 160 purchases and 240 sales in 12 monthsGreek shipowners continue to strengthen their position in the global shipping industry. Just from recent moves  we see Andreas Jr. Martinos expanding Minerva Marine and maintaining a strong presence in containerships  activating an option at a Chinese yard. Danaos by Koustas is said to have placed two more orders for the construction of container ships. In the second-hand ship market  Equinox  owned by Gikas Goumas  made a targeted strike at an auction  securing the Great Vista  a state-of-the-art Ultramax  at a price that shows the Greek side remains highly selective. But the real interest lies in the numbers: 160 purchases and 240 ship sales within twelve months. What does this mean? That the Greeks simultaneously hold the “keys” to being the world’s most active buyers and the most “flexible” sellers.The San Francisco fund  investments in Greece  and KoustasI shouldn’t have started digging into the subject of wannabe investors in Greek shipping. Yesterday I wrote about the Vietnamese and the Germans  and today I found out about Americans — who  however  have already moved from talk to action. So I was told that a San Francisco–based fund has already invested in two Greek-interest companies offering digital services focused on shipping. The fund is True Wind Capital Strategic Investor. It entered Danaos Management Consultants SA  which was co-founded by Giannis Koustas and Dimitris Theodosiou  each owning 50%. From what I hear  Dimitris Theodosiou stepped down as CEO and is now a board member  with his son Nicholas taking over the CEO role. And let me explain what this company does. It is one of the most well-known global tech providers in the shipping industry  combining extensive experience in all aspects of maritime operations (Management  Engineering  Operations  Accounting  Procurement  Brokering  etc.) and in IT (Advanced Development Environments  Communication Technologies  Internet and Mobile Technologies).Also  the other company is Procurship  with which the American fund made its initial investment in Greece. It’s an online procurement platform tailored specifically to the needs of the maritime industry.The HCAP and the EYDAP–EYATH networksThe Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) is claiming a role in water resource management  as stated in a speech by its CEO Giannis Papachristou. HCAP  he argued  can play a significant role in upgrading the water networks of EYDAP and EYATH through the installation of smart meters and in tendering desalination investment projects. He also emphasized the upgrading of port and railway infrastructure  along with the development of new logistics centers  so that Greece can leverage its geostrategic position and establish itself as a gateway to Europe and the Middle East. HCAP has already implemented and launched significant projects  utilizing the ports and marinas in its portfolio  and with tenders currently underway for new logistics business parks in Athens and Thessaloniki. In the same context  HCAP’s Deputy CEO P. Stampoulidis referred to the maturation and tendering of railway network restoration projects  with a budget of approximately €1 billion. These tenders will be handled by the Strategic Contracts Unit (PPF).OAKA in June 2026The restoration and upgrade of the OAKA complex is expected to be completed by the end of June 2026. For the radical upgrade of OAKA  funds from the Recovery and Resilience Facility were used  and the PPF tendered projects worth €90 million  with the total budget exceeding €130 million.Theon valued at €2.45 billionTheon International Plc was listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Euronext Amsterdam) on February 7  2024  with an offer price of €10/share. The initial public offering (IPO) for 25% of its shares raised €154 million  resulting in a valuation of €700 million at that time. Yesterday  the share price was over €34 (+199.53% year-on-year)  and just in the last month  it gained +24.95%. The company’s market capitalization has now reached €2.45 billion. Europe’s defense industry is enjoying unprecedented momentum  and the Greek company specializing in night vision and thermal imaging systems is clearly benefiting. So far  Theon Plc has secured new orders worth around €70 million  guiding revenue estimates towards the half-a-billion-euro mark. For the final quarter of the year  Theon has reserved its biggest orders  while sources from the Greek market suggest that two major investment firms of Greek origin have expressed interest in participating in the EFA Group and will soon announce their involvement.Best refining margins of the year  but the stocks…September turned out to be the best month of 2025 for Greek refineries  with refining margins shooting up to levels unseen in months. Ukrainian bombings of Russian refineries have left their mark on the petroleum market. With Russian output shrinking  Greek refineries — strategically located in the Mediterranean — have become crucial suppliers to the European market. Crack spreads — the difference between crude oil prices and refined products — have risen significantly. For Motor Oil  which operates Greece’s largest refinery in Aspropyrgos  refining margins jumped to 11.1%. For HelleniQ Energy  with two refineries in Elefsina and Thessaloniki  stable international oil prices and high margins create increased per-barrel profitability. Greek refineries are enjoying a rare combination: strong demand  limited supply  and geographic advantage. At the Athens Stock Exchange  all this has so far translated into increased trading volume for Motor Oil (-0.62% at €25.4) and HelleniQ Energy (-1.07% at €8.34)  but not price increases — at least not yet.Investor’s Day for Ideal Holdings on October 13Ten days from now  on Monday  October 13  Ideal Holdings’ management has scheduled the next Investor’s Day  for which investment expectations are once again building — as seen in yesterday’s stock movement. In H1 2025  IDEAL completed one of the biggest acquisitions in recent years in the Greek food sector  acquiring Barba Stathis  and many believe there could be more to come in the industry. A month ago  chairman Lambros Papakonstantinou made it clear that Ideal has never held talks with CVC to acquire any other subsidiary of Vivartia (e.g.  DELTA). Ideal Holdings is the only listed company on the Athens Exchange that invests with the philosophy of private equity funds  so it’s natural for investors to be eager to hear about strategy in new sectors. They’re also clearly waiting for confirmation of the bold dividend policy: a return of 40%–50% of net profits over the next three years.Rally for Cenergy  Viohalco  and AktorAll three stocks are constantly breaking their “ceiling.” However  the setting of new records isn’t happening with mild upward movements but with emphatic bursts — highlighting the legitimacy of their outperformance. A three-day rally of around 7.3% was enough to take Cenergy Holdings from €12 to the doorstep of €13 for the first time ever. Yesterday it clocked over €5 million in turnover — well above its average — and reached €2.7 billion in valuation. Viohalco  its parent company  also hit a new all-time high  with its market cap now just shy of €2 billion. A 3.3% jump erased the losses of the previous two sessions  bringing it within striking distance of €7.7. Aktor continues its unshaken climb to new peaks  closing up 1.4% at €8.84  with a daily high of €8.85 — the highest in the past 18 years. The next closest mark is €8.862 from July 5  2007. To find a higher price  we have to go even further back — to €9.195 on January 28  2004. The group’s market cap has now reached €1.8 billion.Stock market: Coca-Cola HBC’s drop  shares  and resultsAs long as markets don’t signal systemic risk  stock exchanges have no choice but to rise. But the higher valuations climb  the further they stray from real economic fundamentals. On the Athens Stock Exchange  the market “punishes” companies that post unsatisfactory results (see: AustriaCard  Jumbo  Athens Medical Center  etc.) while “rewarding” those that consistently grow in size and performance. All this is happening after a grueling 11-month rally  led by the banking sector  with a few heavyweight stocks following. Yesterday  in an inexplicably euphoric European trading environment with all major indexes in the green  the General Index in Athens moved cautiously and nervously — yet remained in positive territory. It reached a technically crucial 2 069.57 points (+0.64%) at one point but slipped to 2 057.26 (+0.04%) by the close. The net trading value reflects this careful yet optimistic hesitation: €194.46 million  of which €13 million was in block trades. The heaviest stock in the Greek market  Coca-Cola HBC  dropped -2.16% to €38.9 — continuing to send a warning signal about something unknown (but apparently some suspect is coming)  with nearly €5 million in trades.,neutral,0.03,0.73,0.24,mixed,0.18,0.28,0.55,True,English,"['Kövesi', 'Count Nikos', 'P.M.', 'Skeleton Operation', 'Indian bankers', 'Constitution', 'Kimberly', 'Greece', 'Cretan', 'European prosecutor Kövesi', 'U.S. government shutdown', 'Ms. Kövesi', 'industrial electricity rates', 'U.S. Embassy', 'P.M. level', 'Athens Concert Hall', 'other corruption issues', 'Deputy Prime Minister', 'hunger striker Ruci', 'European funds', 'populist) issues', 'electricity costs', 'other words', 'other countries', 'interesting topics', 'Syntagma Square', 'ministers Floridis', 'main focus', 'tax evasion', 'recycling huts', 'ministerial responsibility', 'legislative matters', 'national elections', 'right-wing governments', 'coalition governments', 'small step', 'obvious plan', 'distinguished lawyer', 'Count Nikos', 'defense innovation', 'sudden praise', 'two interviews', 'key reform', 'Armed Forces', 'political cost', 'fine winter', 'Maximos Mansion', 'energy-intensive industries', 'Spyros Theodoropoulos', 'SVE president', 'Loukia Saranti', 'relevant discussion', 'keynote speaker', 'General Assembly', 'supermarket chain', 'massive property', 'massive supermarket', 'Anargyros mansion', 'national benefactor', 'Korgialeneios School', 'similar properties', 'many shops', 'Skeleton Operation', 'Six votes', 'essential staff', 'diplomatic sources', 'sensitive matter', 'government matter', 'Nikos Dendias', 'Kimberly Guilfoyle', 'Hydra–Spetses', 'Dendias’ bill', 'Adonis–Dendias', 'Newsroom', 'yesterday', 'statements', 'Parliament', 'everything', 'visits', 'Chrysochoidis', 'Pierrakakis', 'smuggling', 'Port', 'Piraeus', 'degree', 'OPEKEPE', '717 case', 'course', 'grabs', 'Greece', 'truth', 'judges', 'woman', 'Marinakis', 'spokesperson', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'Constitution', 'revising', 'conversation', 'parties', 'stance', 'Article', 'citizen', 'judiciary', 'charges', 'filters', 'safeguards', 'decades', 'PASOK', 'SYRIZA', 'pancake', 'time', 'profile', 'turn', 'father', 'child', 'death', 'Famellos', 'something', 'Mitsotakis', 'Cabinet', 'speech', 'Copenhagen', 'ELCAC', 'Pentagon', 'deals', 'barbs', 'Eugenidis', 'Protothema', 'SKAI', 'eggs', 'Decisions', 'announcements', 'meeting', 'office', 'Hatzidakis', 'follow-up', 'SEV', 'Papastavrou', 'Theodorikakos', 'Tsafos', 'Petralias', 'Tuesday', 'Cretan', 'founder', 'Anargyreios', 'rent', 'islands', 'friend', 'appointment', 'budget', 'Democrats', 'arrival']",2025-10-03,2025-10-04,en.protothema.gr
