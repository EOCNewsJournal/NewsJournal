Has he?,"This is what US President Donald Trump wrote on his social-media platform  Truth Social  after the US-designated terrorist group expressed willingness to release all Israeli hostages held captive for nearly two years.Israel also responded positively to the announcement  saying it was preparing for the first phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan.Voila—the self-confessed deal maker appears to have delivered what he long promised the world: an end to the brutal Gaza war  which has claimed over 60 000 Palestinian lives in retaliation for the October 2023 terror attack that killed roughly 1 200 people and left 251 abducted.But will it translate into a lasting peace in the region?For starters  Hamas hasn’t signed on the dotted line—the list of reservations is long.Trump's Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict requires the complete surrender from Hamas—which has been running the embattled city for almost two decades—with the promise of a safe passage to go where they wish  including Jordan  Egypt  Qatar  or Iran.But given the fraught history it shares with Israel  there are lingering doubts over whether Benjamin Netanyahu will actually follow through and allow them to leave safely.No  Israel doesn’t want to take over Gaza.The plan is that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) withdraw slowly as the proposed peacekeeping force—the International Stabilisation Force (ISF)—comprising personnel from the US  Arab nations  and other countries  gains control.The ISF would train local police  prevent the smuggling of weapons  and ensure the smooth flow of aid and supplies  in close coordination with Jordan and Egypt.Until then  the IDF will maintain a “security perimeter""  which is essentially a buffer zone—and  yes  people aren’t happy about that.Next comes governance—the “Day After"" plan.Gaza would be managed by a temporary  neutral team of Palestinian professionals and international experts. They would handle day-to-day operations—public services  city management  and more—and report to a new body: the “Board of Peace"".And who would be at the helm of that board?You guessed it—Mr. Trump.Another surprise inclusion is Tony Blair  the former British prime minister who served as an international peace envoy to the Middle East. (By the way  recall the Iraq WMD scandal? What are the odds that people in the Middle East would have forgotten that…?)Still  the plan includes measures to ensure that “New Gaza"" poses no threat to any country  asking neighbouring states to keep Hamas and other groups in check.If all this works out  Trump may indeed become a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. The key participants of the Oslo Accords—a series of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in the 1990s  aimed at achieving a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict—all won the prize.That and all the opportunities for Trump's real estate business—his son-in-law  Jared Kushner  has strong connections with Middle Eastern power players.Peace in the Middle East could also open up significant trade opportunities for India. But there’s the twist: Pakistan has been unusually close to the US during the rollout of this peace plan. Trump even thanked Jordan  the UAE  Saudi Arabia  and India’s regional rival for being genuine participants in the process.This is going to get a bit awkward for India.Meanwhile  here are some of the week's other headlines:While Trump was busy fixing the world  the world’s oldest democracy screeched to a halt.Parts of the US government came to a standstill this week as the President’s Republican Party clashed with Democrats over a spending bill. Republicans control both chambers of Congress  but in the Senate—the upper chamber—they fall short of the 60 votes needed to pass the legislation.The standoff centres on healthcare spending. Democrats have refused to support a Republican bill they argue would make healthcare less affordable for Americans. Budget confrontations are common in US politics  but this one is especially tense because Trump has spent the past nine months cutting the size of the federal government.In retaliation  Trump froze $26 billion allocated to Democratic-leaning states  following through on a threat to use the shutdown to target Democratic priorities. When normal operations might resume is anyone’s guess. The last shutdown of this kind  in 2018 during Trump’s first term  lasted 35 days—the longest in US history.Trump has proposed using American cities as training grounds for the armed forces and spoke of needing US military might to combat what he called the “invasion from within"".Addressing a meeting of top US military commanders who were abruptly summoned back home to listen to Trump and defence secretary (or war secretary since the department has been renamed department of war) Pete Hegseth  the US President outlined a muscular and  at times  norm-shattering view of the military’s role in domestic affairs.Hegseth  on his part  demanded an end to “woke"" culture and announced new directives for troops that include “gender-neutral"" or “male-level"" standards for physical fitness.China and the US have been attempting to negotiate a trade deal  and the negotiations have been intense. Both presidents would like to tell their people that they wrung out significant concessions from the other.Word is that Xi Jinping is pushing for the US to change a decades-old phrase describing its stance on Taiwan independence  a concession that would be seen as a major diplomatic win for Beijing.China has asked the Trump administration to officially declare that it “opposes"" Taiwan independence. This would be stronger than the Joe Biden administration’s previous statement that the US does “not support"" self-ruled Taiwan seeking formal independence.The European Union (EU) is looking for a way to fund Ukraine's defence and reconstruction with the Russian central bank's assets immobilized in the West after Moscow's invasion.There is political support for the idea in principle. But there is a small problem: Under international law  sovereign assets cannot be confiscated.So  some countries  most notably Belgium  want clarity on the legal and fiscal risks. Belgium hosts the Euroclear financial clearing house that holds bonds for the Russian central bank.These bonds have matured  and the resulting cash balances have been frozen due to EU sanctions against Moscow and are being held by Euroclear.The EU believes it can circumvent this issue by redirecting these cash balances to the EU. In return  the European Commission would issue zero-coupon bonds to Euroclear for the same amount.Elizabeth Roche is an associate professor at O.P.
