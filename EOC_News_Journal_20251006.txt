Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up  you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .While SWIFT has long served as the messaging layer for cross-border money movement  the new platform would put it closer to the center of value transfer.That’s a major shift for a more than 50-year-old traditional financial organization known for handling communications between more than 11 500 banks  not for moving money itself.SWIFT's changing role""The big development is SWIFT’s changing business model to cope with blockchain disintermediation "" said Noelle Acheson  author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. “SWIFT  today  does not transfer value; it sends messages. Onchain  the message and the transfer are the same thing.Acheson argued the new platform could act as a ""switching"" layer for digital currencies and tokenized assets  bridging otherwise siloed systems. However  she questioned whether SWIFT is still essential in a world of programmable money.""Is SWIFT necessary in a tokenized financial system? No  it’s not—but it does have connections with virtually all global banks "" she said.Onboarding banks to stablecoinsThose connections could give SWIFT an edge as banks look for a path into the blockchain economy.""The industry is moving at a rapid pace  and stablecoins are being adopted globally at such a speed that traditional banks are having to take notice ” said Barry O’Sullivan  director of banking and payments at OpenPayd.SWIFT said over 30 financial institutions are already engaged with the project. O’Sullivan expects more to follow as demand and regulatory clarity increase. ""Adoption  interoperability and regulatory alignment will take time "" he said. ""However  SWIFT is clearly positioning itself to play a meaningful role in shaping the evolving stablecoin and tokenised asset ecosystem.""SWIFT's platform could also ""materially lower"" technical barriers and integration costs for financial institutions that want to embed stablecoins into their operations  said David Duong  head of institutional research at Coinbase.O’Sullivan noted that the platform could bring ""some standardization to the global stablecoin ecosystem "" though fragmentation will likely persist. ""Existing private stablecoins  CBDCs and regional solutions may continue to operate in parallel ” he said.Years in the makingDuong described SWIFT's initiative as a ""watershed moment"" for both crypto and traditional finance  but reminded that it has been years in the making. The company has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology since 2017  Duong said  including conducting pilot projects with Chainlink  tokenized securities platforms Clearstream and SETL and interoperability tests with CBDCs. Developing its own shared ledger platform appears to be the next stage in that long-running transition  Duong said.Still  not everyone may see SWIFT as a neutral player. Its role in enforcing sanctions has led to distrust in countries where banks were cut off from the network  Acheson said.""It’s not clear that its offering would stop the payment systems fragmentation  given global distrust following SWIFT’s role in enforcing U.S. and EU sanctions ” she argued.Even so  SWIFT’s decision underscores that the lines between traditional and blockchain finance are increasingly getting intertwined and the world’s largest financial institutions are – slowly  then suddenly – taking initiative to stay relevant.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.19,0.36,0.45,True,English,"['Transformational Move Means', 'Global Banks', 'SWIFT', 'Blockchain', 'Stablecoins', 'full-fledged blockchain infrastructure provider', '50-year-old traditional financial organization', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'global financial messaging system', 'tokenized financial system', 'tokenised asset ecosystem', 'lower"" technical barriers', 'tokenized securities platforms', 'changing business model', 'largest financial institutions', 'global stablecoin ecosystem', 'cross-border money movement', 'Barry O’Sullivan', 'Existing private stablecoins', 'payment systems fragmentation', '30 financial institutions', 'messaging layer', 'blockchain disintermediation', 'blockchain economy', 'evolving stablecoin', 'blockchain finance', 'traditional finance', 'global distrust', 'tokenized assets', 'global banks', 'multiple blockchains', 'CoinDesk products', 'privacy policy', 'major shift', 'changing role', 'big development', 'same thing', 'switching"" layer', 'digital currencies', 'programmable money', 'rapid pace', 'regulatory clarity', 'regulatory alignment', 'integration costs', 'institutional research', 'regional solutions', 'watershed moment', 'ledger technology', 'pilot projects', 'next stage', 'running transition', 'neutral player', 'U.S.', 'ledger platform', 'new platform', 'traditional banks', 'meaningful role', 'David Duong', 'interoperability tests', 'EU sanctions', 'Noelle Acheson', 'value transfer', 'making Duong', '11,500 banks', 'SWIFT', 'backbone', 'step', 'network', 'plans', 'transactions', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'use', 'center', 'communications', 'author', 'messages', 'Onchain', 'siloed', 'world', 'connections', 'path', 'industry', 'speed', 'notice', 'director', 'banking', 'payments', 'OpenPayd', 'demand', 'Adoption', 'time', 'operations', 'head', 'Coinbase', 'standardization', 'CBDCs', 'parallel', 'Years', 'initiative', 'company', 'Chainlink', 'Clearstream', 'SETL', 'long', 'everyone', 'countries', 'offering', 'decision', 'lines']",2025-10-05,2025-10-06,coindesk.com

The presentation includes results from Abivax’s Phase 3 ABTECT 8-Week Induction Trials investigating obefazimod for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis  including previously reported findings and additional safety data at week 8.“There is an urgent need for new therapies to treat ulcerative colitis that deliver durable efficacy  safety  and the simplicity of oral  once-daily dosing ” said Bruce Sands  MD*  Professor of Medicine  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""The ABTECT Trials enrolled individuals with advanced disease  including many who had failed multiple lines of advanced therapy and a significant percentage of patients with prior JAK inhibitor failure. The refractory nature of this population underscores the significance of the results presented today.”A total of 1272 patients were enrolled across the ABTECT 1 & 2 trials. In the pooled full data set across ABTECT 1 & 2  no signal for serious  severe  or opportunistic infections or malignancies was observed. The most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (6%-placebo  16%-25mg  24.1%-50mg) with <1% of headaches leading to study discontinuation (0.3% at 25mg; 1.1% at 50mg)  and nausea (1.3% in placebo  5.0% at 25mg  7.2% at 50mg).Results from the ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 trials demonstrated that obefazimod met its FDA primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8 in the 50 mg once-daily dose regimen for both trials. Individually  ABTECT-1 showed a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 19.3% (p<0.0001) and ABTECT-2 demonstrated 13.4% (p=0.0001)  each at the 50 mg once-daily dose  with all key secondary efficacy endpoints being met.*Bruce Sands  MD is a paid consultant for AbivaxInvestor Conference Call and WebcastAbivax management will host an investor and analyst conference call tomorrow on October 6  2025  at 9:00 a.m. ET / 3:00 p.m. CET to discuss the topline results.

Just 74% of SMEs reach basic levels of digitalisation  and less than 30% are adopting advanced technologies such as AI  sophisticated cloud tools  and data analytics.""""That is a competitiveness gap we urgently need to close "" Mr Fitzgerald said.Technology Ireland  the Ibec group that represents the technology sector  has also called for investment in AI training programmes for workers.In its pre-budget submission  it urged the Government to use the National Training Fund for strategic  large-scale investment to equip workers with advanced digital capabilities.""As we look toward 2030  the next five years will be pivotal for Ireland and the global economy "" said Director of Technology Ireland Una Fitzpatrick.""Investment in skills and innovation is not a discretionary spend - it is a national imperative.""The National Training Fund is employers' money  collected to invest directly in workforce transformation. Using it strategically is key to unlocking Ireland’s AI-enabled future "" Ms Fitzpatrick said.Technology Ireland has also called for the swift implementation of the recommendations of Silicon Island: Ireland’s National Semiconductor Strategy.Changes to tech regulationTechnology Ireland said there is a growing need for simplification  coherence  and predictability in how these rules are implemented and interpreted across Member StatesThe Technology Ireland pre-budget submission includes a call on the Government to simplify the regulatory burdens facing tech companies.The group said that a complex framework of EU digital and AI-related regulation  has created significant compliance burdens for tech companies - particularly startups and SMEs.""This risks stifling innovation and eroding Ireland and Europe's competitiveness in the global tech race "" Technology Ireland said.""There is a growing need for simplification  coherence  and predictability in how these rules are implemented and interpreted across Member States.""It added that Ireland  as a leading European tech hub  has a ""strategic interest in advocating for a more streamlined and innovation-friendly regulatory environment at the EU level"".Read more: Government urged to simplify regulatory burden on tech sectorTechnology Ireland said that while it supports enhancing online safety  the approach taken by Government and regulators over the past few years has created an overly burdensome landscape for business which often goes beyond the spirit of EU law.""National law which fragments and creates a patchwork of EU frameworks or delays the implementation of rules risks Ireland’s reputation as a trusted regulatory partner in the EU "" the group said.In its submission  Technology Ireland said regulators should be guided to consider the economic impact of their work and plans on the whole economy  and should function in a manner that serves competitiveness and public interest objectives.Start-up tech companiesOne ask is for the introduction of a lower CGT rate on gains on investments in SMEs  whilst leaving the 33% rate in place for gains in investment propertyAccording to Scale Ireland  which represents start-up companies  there are 2 099 Irish start-ups and scale-ups employing 45 652 people.For its pre-budget submission  Scale Ireland joined forces with other organisations in the sector including HBAN  a network of business angel groups and syndicates; IVCA  the representative body for venture capital and private equity firms; Euronext  the pan-European exchange; and TechIreland  an independent not-for-profit which promotes Irish-based innovation.The 'Alliance for Innovation' said it wants to see greater efforts from the Government to help mobilise private capital  as well as reviews of the effectiveness of current state supports.The group is also looking for reforms of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in Budget 2026.The Alliance said that Ireland’s CGT level is comparatively high compared to that of competitors and this affects the attractiveness of business incentives.""The Alliance supports the introduction of a lower 20% rate of CGT on gains arising on the disposals of investments in start-up and scaling companies for founders  investors and staff to increase our competitiveness "" the submission stated.""For instance  the introduction of a lower CGT rate on gains on investments in SMEs  whilst leaving the 33% rate in place for gains in investment property  should encourage private capital to invest in productive assets capable of delivering greater employment and economic benefit to the state "" it added.The Alliance is also looking for the establishment of a taskforce to look at unlocking pension fund savings into indigenous companies  the speedy establishment of a new Enterprise Scaling Fund  as well as reforms of the Employment Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS).Video game sectorIreland's digital gaming sector could be worth around €250 millionThe global video game industry is now worth more than the music and film sectors combined  with the estimated value expected to reach over $385bn (€327bn) in the coming years.It is thought that Ireland's digital gaming sector could be worth around €250 million.Video game companies have called for changes to a tax credit for their industry to be announced in next week's Budget.The Digital Game Tax Credit was launched in November 2022 and offers companies developing digital games a tax credit of up to 32% per qualifying game.However  take up of the tax credit has been slow amid claims by game studios that its structure is limiting and that reforms are needed to unlock its full potential.In its pre-budget submission  Imirt  the Irish games representative body  called for improvements to the scheme.It wants claims to be allowed for partial game development projects  currently only companies that develop and complete the entire game development can qualify for the tax relief.Imirt is also calling for the cut-off point for qualifying expenditure to be revised to cover post-launch investments and significant content updates.""While the tax credit has positively signalled support for the industry  its current design limits its practical impact "" the Imirt submission states.""Specifically  it has not stimulated substantial domestic growth  nor foreign direct investment (FDI)  due to structural restrictions in its eligibility criteria "" the group said.According to Imirt  allowing claims for partial game development would help Ireland attract strategic foreign direct investment  foster early-stage innovation  and grow a resilient domestic industry with strong career pathways for workers.It also believes that by revising the cut-off point for qualifying expenditure to include post-launch activity  the tax credit would support the full lifecycle of today’s games  promoting year-round employment and strengthening studio stability.The big beasts of the IT world have such a prominent presence here that they tend to dominate the narrative when we talk about Ireland's tech sector.But groups representing smaller  indigenous technology companies and start-ups say supports in Tuesday's budget could help pave the way for the next Apple  Google or Microsoft to come from
