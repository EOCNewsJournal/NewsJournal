The US president and the German chancellor discussed the situation in Ukraine and agreed to continue joint efforts to end the Ukrainian conflict  Kornelius noted. Trump and Merz also agreed on their positions regarding the events in the Gaza Strip and agreed that a rapid agreement on the release of hostages  an end to hostilities  and the disarmament of Hamas must be reached at the upcoming talks in Egypt  he said. Following the start of Russia's special operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  amounting to approximately 300 billion euros. More than 200 billion euros is held in the EU  primarily in accounts with the Belgian Euroclear  one of the world's largest clearing and settlement systems. In early October  the European Commission reported that the EU had transferred 14 billion euros to Ukraine from January to September 2025  using proceeds from frozen funds of the Russian central bank. In response  Russia introduced its own restrictions: the assets of foreign investors from unfriendly countries and the income derived from them are accumulated in special ""C"" accounts. They can only be withdrawn by decision of a special government commission. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called the freezing of Russian assets in Europe a theft  noting that the EU is targeting not just private funds but also Russian state assets. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow would respond to the confiscation of frozen Russian assets by the West. He added that Russia also has the option of withholding funds held by Western countries from returning them.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251003/stealing-russian-assets-will-create-big-problems-for-euroclear-euro-and-eu-1122906808.htmlrussiaukrainegermanySputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussian frozen assets  russian frozen fund  eu steals russian funds  euroclear  merz-trump call  trump on russia frozen assets",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Merz Briefs', 'Russian Assets', 'Trump', 'Plans', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'British newspaper Financial Times', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'US President Donald Trump', 'sergey lavrov russia', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'German government spokesman', 'Russian central bank', 'russian frozen fund', 'special government commission', 'Russian state assets', 'special ""C"" accounts', 'frozen Russian assets', 'russian frozen assets', 'ukraine european union', 'russia frozen assets', 'foreign investors', 'European Commission', 'russian funds', 'special operation', 'frozen funds', 'Merz Briefs', 'Sputnik International', 'phone conversation', 'interest-free loan', '140 billion euros', 'joint efforts', 'Ukrainian conflict', 'Gaza Strip', 'rapid agreement', 'upcoming talks', 'G7 countries', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'largest clearing', 'settlement systems', 'early October', '14 billion euros', 'unfriendly countries', 'Western countries', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'merz-trump call', 'private funds', 'Stefan Kornelius', 'Belgian Euroclear', 'russia ukraine', 'sputnikglobe', 'merz-briefs', 'plans', 'russian-assets', 'Kiev', 'germany', 'cdn', 'article', 'situation', 'positions', 'events', 'release', 'hostages', 'hostilities', 'disarmament', 'Hamas', 'Egypt', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'world', 'January', 'September', 'proceeds', 'response', 'restrictions', 'income', 'decision', 'freezing', 'Moscow', 'confiscation', 'option', 'big-problems', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-10-06,2025-10-07,sputnikglobe.com

The Group’s 24 hotels in Sydney West also recorded strong gains  with occupancies also reaching 98% over the weekend.The NRL Grand Final once again proved the pulling power of live sport in Sydney. The presence of two interstate teams intensified demand across the city  delivering a powerful boost for hotels  restaurants  and neighbourhood businesses.The NRL Grand Final is more than a sporting contest – it is a major event that energises the city. Fans travelled in large numbers to be here  and that commitment translated directly into stronger occupancies and a significant economic impact. Adrian Williams  Chief Operating Officer of Accor in the Pacific regionBeyond the stadium  the game generated a city-wide buzz  with precincts from Parramatta to Circular Quay alive with travelling fans. Restaurants  bars and attractions benefited from the influx  underscoring the role major sporting events play in energising not only hotels but also the wider visitor economy. The weekend highlighted Sydney’s strength as a destination that thrives on live sport  tourism and hospitality working hand in hand.Meanwhile in Melbourne  the AFL Grand Final held at the MCG last month also welcomed a major influx of visitors  reinforcing its reputation as one of the nation’s most enduring cultural events. Accor welcomed thousands of travelling fans across its 51 hotels in Greater Melbourne.Adrian Williams added: Live sport continues to prove itself as one of Australia’s most powerful economic drivers. Australians are willing to travel  spend and celebrate because the experience of being there in person cannot be replicated online or on television.Accor is proud to be the Official Accommodation Partner of both the NRL and AFL.From luxury to economy  Accor operates more than 20 international brands across Australia  New Zealand  Fiji and French Polynesia  including Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s Hyde  SO/ and Mondrian.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

An initial tranche of $215 million will be used to repay in full the Company’s existing debt facility with Deerfield Management Company and OrbiMed  inclusive of associated fees and expenses. The remaining up to $285 million may be drawn in the future for potential business development subject to mutual agreement between the parties. The Agreement was executed today and the initial tranche is expected to be funded in the coming weeks.Highlights of the new facility include:Lowered cost of capital : Improved financial terms  including more favorable fixed interest rate and lower prepayment and exit fees compared to previous debt facility: Improved financial terms  including more favorable fixed interest rate and lower prepayment and exit fees compared to previous debt facility Improved structure and flexibility : Converted from an amortizing structure to a more capital efficient bullet maturity after five years  with no financial covenants: Converted from an amortizing structure to a more capital efficient bullet maturity after five years  with no financial covenants Access to non-dilutive growth capital: Additional tranche(s) may be drawn for purposes of future value creation through business developmentThis new facility significantly enhances Valneva’s financial flexibility  as the Company will no longer be required to begin making amortization payments in 2026.

At Pharmakon  we remain committed to supporting high-quality life sciences companies with tailored capital solutions.”Business UpdatesValneva Financial outlook for fiscal year 2025:Following the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to suspend the product license for IXCHIQ®  and given the ongoing uncertainty as the Company awaits further information from the FDA  Valneva hereby revises its 2025 financial guidance as follows:Product sales now expected between €155-170 million (previously €170-180 million)  depending on the timing of shipments of drug substance to commercial partners in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); the commercial business is still expected to be cash flow positiveTotal revenues now expected to reach €165-180 million (previously €180-190 million)Total R&D investments reduced to between €80-90 million (previously €90-100 million)  partially offset by grant funding and anticipated R&D tax creditsAdditionally  Valneva reconfirms that the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Lyme disease vaccine candidate remains on track. Pfizer continues to aim to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to European Medicines Agency in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data. Participants in the VALOR trial will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases until the end of 2025.

""Importantly  we have trained surgeons  obtained Value Analysis Committee (VAC) approvals and achieved successful coverage from major payors including CMS. What's also particularly encouraging is the strong demand we're seeing from physicians  with surgeons actively reaching out for training opportunities  many of whom already have patients lined up for implants. These early leading indicators give us confidence that we're building the right foundation for the sustained adoption of Genio moving forward.”Andrew T. Huang  MD FACS  Director of Sleep Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine implanted the first Genio devices at Townsen Memorial Health System in Houston  TX. “I am excited to not only be the first surgeon to perform Genio® implants commercially in the United States but to have completed my first five in one week. It was awesome to see the powerful and symmetric tongue protrusion at the end of each procedure. Like with any new procedure  there is a learning curve  but I’m excited to say the cases took me the same amount of time as my first unilateral HGN implants. The Genio system provides a solution for my patients who do not want two incisions  an implanted battery  and those where bilateral stimulation may be more beneficial to their airway anatomy. ” commented Dr. Huang. “Obstructive sleep apnea continues to represent a significant health burden in our country  and expanding access to new therapeutic options is essential. I am happy this therapy is now available in the US and am honored to help improve access to Genio Therapy by offering it to my patients and helping to train more providers on this amazing procedure.”The Company is tracking the following metrics which it believes will serve as leading indicators of future revenue growth:Number of surgeons trained;Number of value analysis committee submissions made;Number of prior authorization submissions; andNumber of accounts opened.About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat OSA.

But one thing’s been overlooked in the years-long debate - and that’s the value of catching up with colleagues to socialise after work.Heineken® has long championed making connections with people face to face  and now  with 46% of hybrid workers saying they miss out on post-work patter  the beer brand is offering a free pint of Heineken® Original or Heineken® 0.0 for workers and their colleagues at more than 1 000 pubs.Some 22 million people across the UK enjoy after work socialising with their colleagues  but that figure has seen a slight reduction from pre-pandemic figures (down 5%). Since then  new working practices mean some 58% of Gen Z hybrid workers have never met some of those they work with - and that’s despite 72% of them agreeing the best place to build a relationship with your co-workers is outside of work.The after-work social has long been a sacred British tradition  fostering connections and fuelling productivity. Some 78% of workers polled said after work socialising is a good way to meet new people and contacts. A further 32% said they have their most honest conversations at the pub  while 74% of Gen Z claimed they have their best work ideas not at work  but at the pub social straight afterwards.It should be no surprise  then  that a new report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed that every £10 spent on after-work socialising brings an additional £13.40 to the wider economy.In fact  after-work socialising is set to sustain an aggregate economic footprint of £28.9bn in the UK 2025 alone  and the sector supports a massive 300 000 full-time equivalent jobs.What’s more  some 45% of workers say knowing their manager on a more personal level can strengthen their career prospects. There’s good news for businesses too: 59% said they’d be less likely to quit a job if they had a strong relationship with their colleagues.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken®  said: ""The return-to-oﬃce chat continues to stir up debate. After years of video calls and virtual cheers it’s safe to say that while we might not miss the oﬃce  we’ve certainly missed those real  in-person laughs with our colleagues. At Heineken  we’ve always believed the best moments happen when people get together  so this month we’re raising our pints to ‘circling back’ to our colleagues – at the pub.""While a handful of pubs are cheekily changing their signs  more than 1 000 pubs in England are taking part in the offer of a free pint of Heineken or Heineken 0.0 to share with colleagues. Simply sign up here to receive a voucher  which can be shared with up to three friends (one pint per person)  Monday to Friday throughout October from 4:59pm. In Scotland and Wales  scan the QR code in-pub or head online after 4:59pm for the chance to win limited-edition Heineken merch.Notes to editors Media contact:heinekencultureuk@wearetheromans.comAdditional statistics:Londoners are the most enthusiastic after-work socialisers: some 87.6% head out with their colleagues at least once a yearWorkers in science  technology and research are the most likely to socialise with colleagues - and it is no coincidence these workers are also most likely to be back in the office five days a weekResearch Credits:*Heineken commissioned a survey of 1 008 UK office workers.

Photograph: iStockIrish households are sitting on record cash balances.According to the Central Bank of Ireland  we now hold well over €163 billion in deposits. For many families  that cushion has been hard-won  the product of careful budgeting through a cost of living squeeze.But there’s a stark truth that needs to be emphasised: leaving the bulk of our long-term savings in cash is quietly eroding our future wealth.Over the past decade  negative and near-zero interest rates offered poor returns. Even today  when rates are higher  inflation can outpace what ordinary deposit accounts deliver.If we want future generations to build wealth with confidence  and if we want Irish businesses to access the long-term equity capital they need  we must make it easier for people to invest for the long run. A simple  proven way to do that is a Savings and Investment Account  or SIA.ASIA is exactly what it sounds like – a straightforward account that allows people to put money into diversified  regulated investments with fair  transparent fees and appropriate consumer protections  while benefiting from tax incentives that reward long-term saving.It provides a user-friendly way of setting money aside with the potential to grow in line with the real economy.Euronext Dublin recently commissioned research by Amarách that found that half of Irish savers would put some of their savings into an accessible investment account if their banks offered it  and this rockets to 74 per cent if the Government were to add a tax incentive.This isn’t a leap into the unknown. Variants already work well in other countries – France  Italy and Poland are examples.[ How can you make your savings work harder?Opens in new window ]In the UK  Individual Savings and Accounts (ISAs) have channelled billions into productive assets while giving citizens a clear  tax-efficient path to invest. Sweden’s Investeringssparkonto (ISK) – a simple  digital account with clear rules and portable between providers – has helped create one of the strongest retail investor bases in Europe.And just this week  the European Commission issued a recommendation calling on member states to establish savings and investment accounts  to encourage savers to invest in accessible products  backed by shares and bonds  and incentivised by tax measures.The direction of travel is clear.Ireland should move early and decisively. We have a well-regulated market  high levels of savings  and a generation under the age of 50 who are digitally fluent yet priced out of many traditional wealth-building routes. Give them a tool that is simple  clear and fair ... and they will use it with benefits all round.Firstly  households will build wealth more effectively. Regular  long-term investing clearly outperforms keeping long-term savings in cash  especially once you account for inflation.That return difference compounds powerfully over decades. As one example  for a 28-year-old contributing €200 a month  the gap between cash-like returns and diversified market returns can be the difference between financial fragility and financial resilience at age 50. A SIA doesn’t have to just benefit higher earners.[ How to build wealth in Ireland: Save and invest in your 20s and 30sOpens in new window ]The goal is to expand investment to be accessible to all citizens. It’s also a very practical way to develop financial literacy in our country.Secondly  Irish businesses will gain access to more domestic capital. Today  we hear a lot about funding gaps and innovative Irish scale-ups looking abroad to find growth funding.A SIA isn’t a silver bullet but it can help create a broader base of local investors with a genuine stake in Ireland’s productive economy  including through increased investment in listed shares of growing Irish companies.With everything that’s happening in the world right now  it makes sense to build our home-grown economic and financial resilience.Getting Irish savers to move from a situation where they leave billions of euro lying idle on deposit to a culture of investment could be transformative from Ireland.An Irish SIA can be a smart  concrete step that helps deliver this shift by playing to our national strengths: a tech-savvy population  high savings and world-class financial regulation. By not having an Irish SIA model  Irish savers  Irish businesses and the Irish economy are all potentially missing out.The European Commission’s call-to-action on savings and investment accounts is a pivotal moment.I know that Ireland’s capital markets and financial services sector stand ready to work with Government to design and rollout a SIA model that will work for Ireland that would give Irish savers an exciting new opportunity to doing something smart with their money.We shouldn’t hang about on this. All we need is a signal from Government. The budget on Tuesday would seem likely exactly the right time to do that.Daryl Byrne is chief executive of Euronext Dublin,neutral,0.18,0.81,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.2,0.37,True,English,"['Irish long-term savers', 'user-friendly, regulated investments', 'tax breaks', 'wealth', 'strongest retail investor bases', 'many traditional wealth-building routes', 'diversified, regulated investments', 'fair, transparent fees', 'appropriate consumer protections', 'smart, concrete step', 'simple, digital account', 'clear, tax-efficient path', 'Regular, long-term investing', 'simple, proven way', 'world-class financial regulation', 'financial services sector', 'exciting new opportunity', 'innovative Irish scale-ups', 'growing Irish companies', 'near-zero interest rates', 'The European Commission', 'long-term equity capital', 'record cash balances', 'An Irish SIA', 'diversified market returns', 'accessible investment account', 'ordinary deposit accounts', 'Irish SIA model', 'many families', 'accessible products', 'straightforward account', 'clear rules', 'long-term saving', 'poor returns', 'user-friendly way', 'new window', 'cash-like returns', 'financial fragility', 'financial resilience', 'practical way', 'financial literacy', 'domestic capital', 'capital markets', 'Irish businesses', 'Irish economy', 'A SIA', 'Irish savers', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Amarách', 'Central Bank', 'careful budgeting', 'living squeeze', 'stark truth', 'past decade', 'future generations', 'long run', 'tax incentives', 'real economy', '74 per cent', 'other countries', 'productive assets', 'member states', 'tax measures', 'high levels', 'one example', 'higher earners', 'funding gaps', 'growth funding', 'silver bullet', 'broader base', 'local investors', 'genuine stake', 'productive economy', 'grown economic', 'national strengths', 'tech-savvy population', 'pivotal moment', 'investment accounts', 'Irish households', 'return difference', 'Individual Savings', 'high savings', 'future wealth', 'research', 'half', 'banks', 'Photograph', 'iStock', 'Ireland', 'deposits', 'cushion', 'cost', 'bulk', 'negative', 'inflation', 'confidence', 'people', 'ASIA', 'money', 'potential', 'line', 'Government', 'leap', 'unknown', 'Variants', 'France', 'Italy', 'Poland', 'examples', 'Opens', 'UK', 'ISAs', 'billions', 'citizens', 'Sweden', 'Investeringssparkonto', 'ISK', 'portable', 'providers', 'recommendation', 'shares', 'bonds', 'direction', 'travel', 'age', 'tool', 'benefits', 'decades', '28-year-old', '20s', 'goal', 'country', 'lot', 'listed', 'everything', 'sense', 'home', 'situation', 'culture', 'shift', 'action', 'something', 'signal', 'Tuesday']",2025-10-06,2025-10-07,irishtimes.com

That the Crete-Cyprus electricity interconnection project had festered is well known  with the risk not only of the project being canceled and causing a significant financial burden on ADMIE and  by extension  the Greek consumer  but also of putting in question the unbreakable front between Athens and Nicosia  ultimately serving Turkey’s goal of derailing the project. Now  at Maximos Mansion yesterday  they kept their cool  and common sense along with the national line of “Greece and Cyprus are always together” prevailed. K. Mitsotakis and N. Christodoulides met in New York and agreed  as stated in the joint communiqué  on the next steps for the GSI.Viability…-The project will  of course  move forward once the fundamental doubts about its viability—which have been raised by the Cypriot government—are resolved  and once the pending technical and financial issues are settled (i.e.  the outstanding payments from the Cypriots to ADMIE).ADMIE and the clauses with French company Nexans-ADMIE’s biggest problem at the moment is that it has already spent €250 million on the cable’s construction (plus €48 million to buy the project from the Cypriots)  which the Cypriot side does not acknowledge—or more precisely  acknowledges unilaterally  since so far it has only agreed to cover expenses amounting to €82 million  which of course it’s not paying either. Based on the interstate agreement signed last September between the Greek and Cypriot governments  if the project halts due to geopolitical risks  the cost will be split 50-50 between the two states. Therefore  of the €82 million recognized by the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority (RAEK)  ADMIE will receive €41 million from the Cypriots  while according to the MoU  it should get €125 million (half of the €250 million)  with the rest covered by the Greek side. ADMIE risks shouldering a massive cost  on top of the penalties tied to its contract with French firm Nexans for the project’s non-implementation  amounting to €1.9 billion. The whole scene also includes an ongoing investigation by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office into the electricity interconnection cable—of which we know very little.Rouchi and the Blues-Let me turn now to a case where I find the political behavior intriguing—mainly that of Dendias  because in Avramopoulos’ case I don’t think it really matters. Dendias  a serious politician  with a profile that’s never shown signs of populism—if he were like that  he wouldn’t have made tough surgical decisions in the Army—so I really wonder why he handled the Rouchi matter this way. Everyone familiar with the scene knows what’s really going on in this tragic story. And they also know the medical background… So what’s the point of “playing” with and circling around a topic that will soon take its course? Maybe he’s scoring some points with one crowd  but he’s definitely losing with another  more discerning one. I don’t know the balance sheet here  but frankly  it’s surprising.The water meeting-It’s going to be a packed week at Maximos Mansion with several meetings on everyday issues or infrastructure  after K.M.’s travels. Today  for example  another meeting will be held on the issue of water management with Hatzidakis  Papastavrou  etc.  as the final government decisions need to be made regarding management bodies—so that we don’t end up saying “water  water everywhere  and not a drop to drink.”Telis and the media-Lately  there’s been talk that Telis Mystakidis  beyond PAOK (first football  then—after hitting a “door”—basketball)  also wants to get into major media outlets. Now  I asked around with the right people but—don’t get your hopes up for nothing—nothing came up. Those damn things must be made of honey…The €17 billion in budget investments and Intralot’s capital increase at €1.10/share-Today’s an interesting day for the market as well  with the start of Euronext’s public offer—you’ll read more on that below—the submission of the 2026 budget draft  and we’re also awaiting the announcement on Intralot’s capital increase. Starting with the budget draft  the word is that its main feature will be a significant jump in investments reaching €17 billion including the Recovery Fund  based on a growth estimate of 2.4%  and with strong surpluses—meaning there’s room for benefits. As for Intralot  word is the capital increase went very well  with strong demand (rumor has it it was oversubscribed 2.7 times)  which allowed the capital raise to grow to €420 million (up from €400 million)  with a share offering price of €1.10. Not to forget  the stock market seems to be pricing in a positive decision by FTSE/Russell tomorrow night and the possibility of the ASE being upgraded to the Developed Markets category. Now  whether that’s actually good news…The Athens Stock Exchange showdown begins-Today  Monday  the framework for the voluntary public offer to acquire the parent company of the Athens Stock Exchange is expected to be announced. As the column reported  Euronext is starting with a 67% target  but that doesn’t mean much  because over the six-week offer period  they can revise (read: lower) the percentage as they wish. Euronext had improved its initial offer  and the new  improved proposal—backed by the ASE board—offers a swap ratio of 20 ASE shares for 1 new Euronext share  compared to the original 21.029 ASE for 1 Euronext. Based on Euronext’s closing price on July 30  2025  when the improved offer was submitted—€142.7—the ASE was valued at €7.14 per share. Since then  Euronext’s share has dropped to around €125  while ASE’s has also fallen to €6.50. Based on the new offer  the per-share consideration for ASE shareholders comes to €6.25. Critical to the outcome are the positions of both foreign institutional shareholders of ASE and Greek retail investors who control a significant stake. It will be interesting to see how things develop because there are opposing forces at play. For example  Praude Asset Management  ASE’s largest shareholder  is reportedly opposed to Euronext’s offer and has increased its stake to 7.40%. Market chatter says Praude is coordinating with other ASE shareholder funds and will form a united front above 10%  blocking a squeeze-out. On the other hand  Euronext has the advantage of being able to consider the offer successful even at 33% of ASE. There are also technical issues this column doesn’t have insight into. E.g.  a mutual fund investing in Greek stocks may be restricted by its charter from holding foreign shares  like Euronext’s. So what will it do? Wait it out? Sell now? I’ll wrap this up by mentioning that sources say commissions to brokerages for rallying their clients to ensure the success of Euronext’s offer will be very high—an indication of how tough this will be. And as we reported this morning  the official announcement came out  stating that Euronext offers twenty ASE shares for one Euronext share and that the deal’s completion is conditional on acquiring at least 67% of ASE shares.Residents file appeals over Vouliagmeni Beach – ETAD: Privatization with… social terms-As projects move forward and more big names turn their attention to the now much-hyped and extremely pricey Athenian Riviera  the appeals multiply accordingly. After the new appeals over Elliniko (note: those from the municipalities of Glyfada and Alimos and the Metropolitan Municipalities Association for the marina of Agios Kosmas and the new artificial beach came first)  now residents from the Elliniko and Glyfada areas  along with the Cultural  Sports and Beautification Association of Kato Elliniko  have filed to annul the 2018 Presidential Decree on the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) as well as against construction permits—especially objecting to building heights  among other things. Meanwhile  residents near the Vouliagmeni Coast have also mobilized  this time regarding that very beach. This is currently the most interesting project run by the Public Properties Company (ETAD)  which has attracted top-tier business interest and aims to have a contractor selected by year’s end. Residents  through a Council of State appeal  raise the issue of free public access to the beach  since the property in question is considered prime real estate for the investor  who is expected to pour in significant capital for upgrades and  naturally  anticipates substantial returns. Last Friday  from the stage of the Athens Riviera Summit  ETAD CEO I. Chatzigeorgiou assured that the issue has been addressed and that the social terms are clearly included in the tender  with a corresponding commitment required from investors. She also confirmed the target of selecting a contractor by year’s end. Note that in the bidding race are: AIR CANTEEN (see: Georgatos of the Grigoris group)  ATHENS BEACH CLUB (Konstantakopoulos  Prokopiou  Kokkalis)  THE MARGI (see: the 5-star hotel in Vouliagmeni)  the EVERGOOD–GEFSINOUS joint venture (CVC Group – interests of entrepreneur Manolis Vavourakis)  the “REDS S.A.” (ELLAKTOR Group) – “AEGEAN WAREHOUSES S.A.” (Melissanidis Group) consortium  and FAIS HOLDINGS.**Everyone’s into… real estate-What I’m noticing is that the “trend” of entering the real estate market continues  with both familiar and… not-so-familiar names. More and more entrepreneurs from unrelated sectors are launching such companies  most with a clear business plan in mind. Case in point: at the end of September  the “Apantima Real Estate” company made its debut  founded by the Bitharas family  who aren’t limiting their business ventures to the fashion industry. The company’s purpose is the buying and selling of real estate and related activities  with initial share capital set at €200 000  provided by “Mourg Holdings.” This holding company was founded in May with sole shareholder and manager Georgios Bitharas — son of Vasilis and Sofia Bitharas  known for B&F Apparel. Georgios Bitharas is also listed as the manager of “Apantima Real Estate.” Last Friday  yet another company was established  called “Diem Real Estate ” also focused on buying/selling properties and building construction — residential and otherwise. Initial capital: €300 000  with €210 000 contributed by Manolis Vavourakis (well-known businessman behind the catering company “Gefsinous”) and €90 000 by Ms. Dionysia Papadaki. The company will be managed by a board member-manager — a role taken on by Vavourakis.From Riyadh to Athens with an investment agenda-A key step in strengthening the strategic and economic ties between Greece and Saudi Arabia is the two-day visit (today  October 5th  and tomorrow  October 6th) of the Saudi Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources  Bandar bin Ibrahim Alkhorayef  to our country.According to the schedule  Minister Alkhorayef will meet with Greece’s Development Minister  Takis Theodorikakos  to discuss the framework for economic cooperation and investments. He’ll then meet with Minister of Environment and Energy  Stavros Papastavrou  focusing on mineral resource utilization and joint processing projects. He will also visit the Elefsis Shipyards to explore potential collaboration in the shipbuilding sector. On day two  he’ll participate in a Saudi-Greek business roundtable with entrepreneurs and top executives from Greek industries and the mining sector. This visit is significant as Alkhorayef oversees a core pillar of Saudi Arabia’s “Vision 2030” strategy — the ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources. The goal of the plan: reduce the kingdom’s dependence on oil and invest heavily in industry  mining  technology  and international partnerships. Alkhorayef plays a central role in designing and executing major projects involving production chains  foreign investment  and new industrial zones. He is considered a trusted technocrat of the Crown Prince  with no familial ties to the royal family  but a close working relationship — tasked with pushing forward the country’s reforms and industrial development.What are the Saudis doing at ONEX?-The ONEX shipyards are becoming a shipbuilding hub for the broader North Africa  Middle East  and Eastern Mediterranean regions. On September 5th  the South Korean ambassador visited the Elefsis facilities. A week later  the U.S. Secretary of the Interior  Doug Burgum  showed up — notably the first member of the new Trump administration to visit Greece. And today  Monday  October 6th  2025  the same facilities will host Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources  Bandar Ibrahim Alkhorayef  and the CEO of Saudi Arabia’s National Industrial Development Center  Saleh Al-Solami  accompanied by Greek Development Minister  Takis Theodorikakos. Welcoming them will be the President and CEO of ONEX Group  Panos Xenokostas. The visit is part of broader alliances being formed in the shipbuilding sector — in both commercial and defense domains.Greek shipowners relocate to Cyprus-Greek shipping has temporarily “moved” to Cyprus — specifically Limassol — for the Cyprus Conference 2025  one of the world’s top maritime events  co-organized by the Deputy Ministry of Shipping  the Cyprus Shipping Chamber  and the Cyprus Union of Shipowners.From the Greek shipowning elite  present are: George Prokopiou  Thanasis Martinos  Yiannis Xylas  the Treasurer of the Union of Greek Shipowners  Stefanos Angelakos  Yiannis Koustas  Semiramis Paliou  Ioanna Prokopiou (Vice President of BIMCO)  Petros Pappas  Harris Vafeias  Aristides Pittas  Dimitris Melissanidis  and Peter Georgiopoulos.What’s particularly noteworthy is that  just days before key discussions begin at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) — next Tuesday — on the full decarbonization of shipping (net zero)  the IMO Secretary-General  Arsenio Dominguez  is attending the conference  drawing significant attention.Leading the speaker lineup is President of the Republic of Cyprus  Nikos Christodoulides. A reception was held at the Presidential Palace yesterday  Sunday  October 5th  2025.Alessandra dazzled at the Spetses mini Marathon-And since we’re on the topic of travel  let’s stay in the same vibe — masses of people flocked to Spetses this past weekend for the Spetses mini Marathon  now considered one of the top sporting events in the country for amateur sports lovers of all ages…From the business world  standout performances came from L’Oréal Hellas CEO Alessandra Delfini  who impressively finished first in her age group in the 3km open-water swim — crossing from Costa to Spetses!Also noteworthy were the performances of Deloitte CEO Dimitris Koutsopoulos and businessman Alexandros Kikizas of Melissa-Kikizas  who took part in the 10km run.This year’s event broke participation records  validating the early vision of Marina-Lida Koutarelli  the woman behind its organization.The investment mysteries of Kyriakoulis-Corporate announcements tend to have a positive — sometimes even over-the-top — tone.The company has hired two Market Makers to ensure the stock’s liquidity — nothing earth-shattering  considering without it  the stock would be moved to the surveillance category.German company GSI Invest GmbH  controlled by Rigas and Panagiotis Tzortzis (who  through Indigo Marine Inc.  indirectly hold 26.75% of Kyriakoulis)  will finance the company’s €8 million bond loan.Amid all this positive noise  the stock surged +9.74% in a week  reaching a market cap of €16.2 million.But there’s a flip side: the company’s H1 results were released — showing a two-thirds drop in revenue for the first half of the year. And this  in a year where Greece’s tourism is breaking records.Note: Greece led Europe in yacht charters in 2024. These kinds of mysteries aren’t good for the market and raise questions that should be addressed by management to keep investors informed.Eurobank chasing Coca-Cola HBC-The bank rally continues on the Athens Stock Exchange  with systemic bank stocks hitting or flirting with multi-year intraday highs. The banking index closed at a 10-year high  marking its sixth straight gain and breaking through 2 400 points for the first time since November 18  2015. Systemic banks soared to new peaks  with year-to-date returns ranging from 57% to 132%. Piraeus Bank closed at its highest in over four years — topping €7.50  a level unseen since March 2021. The other major banks came close to yearly highs  eyeing records last seen in November 2015. Of note is Eurobank reaching a market cap of €13 billion  now in hot pursuit of the Athens Stock Exchange’s most valuable listing.That title currently belongs to Coca-Cola HBC  but its valuation has dropped to €14.3 billion due to heavy pressure on the stock — the cause of which remains unclear. Systemic banks are also preparing to distribute interim dividends over the next two months  which could give their stocks an extra push.Eurobank and National Bank will make their payouts in mid-November  with Alpha Bank following in early December. Piraeus Bank already returned capital last June.Nikos Tsakos and the “Green” Patriarch-Nikos Tsakos  founder and CEO of the NYSE-listed shipping company  was in New York last week.There  he met with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  who is touring the U.S. and was honored with the Templeton Award — accompanied by a $1.2 million prize for his work in environmental protection.They even dubbed him the “Green Patriarch.” The Tsakos family has close ties with the Patriarchate.Last year  the Patriarch attended the opening of the first private  non-profit Merchant Marine Academy under the auspices of the “Maria Tsakos” Foundation — International Center for Maritime Research and Tradition  in Chios.The Corinth Canal is preparing VIP yacht passages-The Corinth Canal is shifting gears. The Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) subsidiary reported a +9% annual increase in chartered yacht traffic. And since demand is soaring  the Canal is getting ready to launch a fast-track crossing service — something its VIP clients will certainly appreciate. Last week  HCAP replaced the company’s management team in a bid to accelerate its development plans.October for Wall Street is what April is for Athens-During long and steady bull markets  fundamental analysis gives way to technical and statistical analysis. October in Athens kicked off with 3-for-3 winning sessions — weekly gains of +2.21% for the General Index and +6.03% for the Banking Index. Statistics show that April is the most volatile month of the year for the Athens Stock Exchange. But for Wall Street  it’s October. Since 1945  S&P 500 volatility in October exceeds the average of all other months by 33%. This is psychologically reinforced by Wall Street’s historic crashes: 1929  1987 (“Black Monday”)  2008. This collective memory creates self-fulfilling prophecies  making investors overly cautious during the month. This past Friday  despite the U.S. government shutdown and no data releases from the Statistics Bureau  the NYSE cheerfully marched on. S&P 500 gained +1.1% for the week  hitting yet another record. The Dow Jones closed its sixth straight week of gains  also up +1.1%. The Nasdaq climbed +1.3% on the week but dipped -0.3% Friday  as investors took profits from tech. Statistically  October is a rocky month  with risk factors including: overvalued stocks after a rally  geopolitical tensions  and uncertainty over Fed policy in an inflationary environment. But history shows that those who weather the October storms often enjoy strong returns in the final quarter.Europe’s energy relief-The Eurozone seems to be closing the chapter on the energy crisis.German bank Berenberg has crunched the numbers and concluded that the Eurozone is making a remarkable recovery in its energy profile: Fossil fuel import bills dropped to 2.4% of GDP in Q2 2025  down from a historic high of 6.7% at the end of 2022. The data reveal a dramatic correction  bringing energy costs back to pre-pandemic levels — despite greater reliance on expensive LNG (37% of imports vs. 20% in 2021).The turnaround stems from falling global energy prices  a shift — albeit not always efficient — to renewables  and reduced consumption. Brent crude fell to $59.1 per barrel in Q3 from $66 in H1  while gas futures indicate another 5% drop in 2026. The economic impact is already visible: private consumption rose +1.4% in H1  as consumers began to absorb the 37% price spike from 2022.Still  structural challenges remain: European industrial energy prices will continue to lag behind the U.S. due to the costs of the green transition  carbon pricing  and reliance on imported LNG.Germany’s heavy industry has shrunk 17% since 2021  with limited recovery prospects.A return to Nord Stream operations is firmly off the table — the ongoing war and geopolitical realities render dependence on Russia untenable.Europe has chosen energy security over short-term economic gains.,negative,0.0,0.36,0.63,mixed,0.26,0.21,0.53,True,English,"['Greek-Cypriot cables', 'media rumors', 'Spetses Marathon', 'tangled', 'populism', 'Rouchi', 'Telis', 'Arabs', 'ONEX', 'Alessandra', 'Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority', 'Crete-Cyprus electricity interconnection project', 'electricity interconnection cable', 'tough surgical decisions', 'share offering price', 'Developed Markets catego', 'European Public Prosecutor', 'final government decisions', 'significant financial burden', 'major media outlets', 'Cypriot President Christodoulides', 'Cypriot government', 'N.
