53131,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/626025-lagarde-frozen-assets/,ECB boss warns EU against seizing Russian assets,Read Full Article at RT.com,The European Commission has proposed using the frozen funds to guarantee loans to KievAny EU move to use frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine must comply with international law  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday  adding that the institution was following the process closely.The comment comes as EU nations’ leaders are discussing a plan to provide Kiev with a €140 billion ($164 billion) loan backed by Russia’s immobilized central bank assets.The scheme  designed to avoid the legal hurdle of outright confiscation  would invest the blocked Russian funds into EU-backed bonds. The proceeds would then be used to pay off a “reparations loan” to Ukraine.“We very much expect that any scheme that is discussed and eventually introduced at some point in time will be done in accordance with international rules  with international law ” Lagarde told a parliamentary hearing in Strasbourg  according to Reuters.The ECB chief has expressed concern that a legally contentious move could undermine the euro’s credibility  deter investment in euro-denominated assets  and pose a risk to financial stability.“From my vantage point  and with in mind financial stability and the strength of the euro  we will be looking very attentively to make sure that what is proposed is in accordance with international law (and) is mindful of financial stability ” Lagarde said.Proceeds from matured bonds  in which frozen Russian assets were invested following the 2022 escalation of the Ukraine conflict  are now held at Belgium’s Euroclear.The depository holds approximately two-thirds of the $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets immobilized by Western nations. Lagarde has warned that any further action requires consensus among all jurisdictions holding such assets.The EU has transferred over a billion from interest to Kiev so far. Some of the bloc’s members  however  continue to voice concerns about the legal risks associated with such a step.Last week  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said his country would not agree to an EU plan that leverages frozen Russian central bank assets to fund loans for Ukraine without firm guarantees of shared financial responsibility.French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that central bank assets cannot be seized without harming “credibility ” while Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the EU plan “theft” and warned those responsible “will be subjected to legal prosecution.”,negative,0.0,0.32,0.68,negative,0.0,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['ECB boss', 'Russian assets', 'EU', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov', 'Russian central bank assets', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'The European Commission', 'The ECB chief', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'EU nations’ leaders', 'Russian assets', 'frozen funds', 'Russian funds', 'euro-denominated assets', 'Western nations', 'international law', 'legal hurdle', 'outright confiscation', 'EU-backed bonds', 'reparations loan', 'international rules', 'parliamentary hearing', 'contentious move', 'financial stability', 'matured bonds', 'legal risks', 'firm guarantees', 'financial responsibility', 'legal prosecution', 'EU move', 'billion) loan', 'vantage point', 'EU plan', 'Ukraine conflict', '€140 billion', 'loans', 'Kiev', 'Monday', 'institution', 'process', 'comment', 'scheme', 'proceeds', 'time', 'accordance', 'Strasbourg', 'Reuters', 'concern', 'credibility', 'investment', 'mind', 'strength', '2022 escalation', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'depository', 'two-thirds', 'action', 'consensus', 'jurisdictions', 'interest', 'bloc', 'members', 'step', 'country']",2025-10-07,2025-10-08,rt.com

Oleh Hryhorov  the head of …,"Russian forces struck several sites across Ukraine  including a medical facility in the northeastern city of Sumy  after Kyiv carried out a massive drone attack on Russia's Belgorod region  knocking out power to thousands of homes.Oleh Hryhorov  the head of the Sumy regional military administration  said on October 6 that 166 people  including 11 children  were in the medical facility at the time of the attack. According to preliminary reports  there were no casualties.Andriy Yermak  the head of Ukraine's Presidential Office  gave further details  saying the roof of a Perinatal Center caught fire as a result of the Russian strike.""This was one of the most cynical and insidious attacks by the enemy in recent times  as the strike targeted a place where children are born and where staff are constantly present "" Oleksiy Kliuyev  a local volunteer  said in a video message from the roof of the facility in Sumy.""Fortunately  no one was injured  as the staff and new mothers were in the basement  not ignoring the air raid warning "" he added.The northeastern city of Kharkiv came under attack by Russian drones on the evening of October 6  local authorities reported.Oleh Synyehubov  head of the regional military administration  said fires had broken out  and units of the State Emergency Service and emergency medical teams were responding.Mayor Ihor Terekhov said about two dozen explosions were heard within 20 minutes of the drone attack on Kharkiv.Meanwhile  on the other side of the country  in the village of Lapayivka in western Ukraine  classmates of a 15-year-old Ukrainian killed a day earlier along with three family members expressed disbelief.Anastasia Hrytsiv was killed along with three family members when their home was struck during the October 5 attack  which authorities in Kyiv described as one of the worst on western Ukraine.Energy Facilities TargetedRussia's Defense Ministry said it had carried out the October 6 strikes on energy infrastructure and oil facilities in 145 different areas  but it did not acknowledge the attack on the Sumy medical facility.Russia's attacks came after Ukraine launched some 251 drones at the Russian Belgorod region  knocking out power supplies from the Luch electricity substation. The disruption also affected water supplies in some areas due to the shutdown of pumping stations.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said some recent attacks by Ukraine's military on Russian infrastructure have included domestically produced missiles and drones as the country ramps up local production of weapons.""It's important to understand that in recent days Ukraine has been using exclusively Ukrainian products [and] not just drones "" he told a briefing in Kyiv on October 6.By next year the cost of production of drones and rockets alone is expected to reach $35 billion and that over 40 percent of the weapons currently used on the front lines are made in Ukraine or by Ukraine's partners with its coproduction  he said.Zelenskyy noted that  contrary to some media reports  supplies of US-produced weapons have not been affected by the ongoing government shutdown in Washington.Ukraine’s military also targeted a key explosives factory in western Russia and an oil terminal in Russian-occupied Crimea.According to Ukraine's General Staff  multiple explosions were reported at the Y. M. Sverdlov explosives factory  while a large fire broke out at an oil depot in Feodosia  eastern Crimea.Ukraine has also been watching weekend elections in the Czech Republic  where billionaire populist Andrej Babis's ANO party placed first.Babis pledged during the campaign to curb Czech support for Kyiv  including its leadership of an ammunition drive to supply Ukraine with artillery rounds.Babis is in talks with two smaller parties to form a majority government as Czech President Petr Pavel warned of the consequences of ending the military aid program  which Babis has criticized for being overpriced and opaque.""If we were to reduce or even end this support  we would primarily harm ourselves  but ending this support would also have a negative impact on Ukraine  if many more lost their lives "" Pavel said on October 6.In the meantime  the EU is actively discussing how to use some 210 billion euros ($245 billion) of immobilized Russian assets to help Ukraine continue its war effort.The EU froze the funds  which are held in Euroclear securities depository in Belgium  shortly after the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told European lawmakers in Strasbourg on October 6 that any mechanism used to tap the Russian funds must ""be done in accordance with international rules.""By REF/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",neutral,0.0,0.87,0.12,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['Russia', 'Strikes', 'Ukraine', 'Drones', 'Power', 'Belgorod', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'Y.

More than just an inventory  this report outlines the key trends in tomorrow's market.Meanwhile  in order to remain focused on market trends on a regular basis  Artprice has just launched a new press agency  Artprice News  with its long-standing partner Cision PR Newswire. With nearly 30 years of experience as a World Leader in Art Market Information  we will now be publishing daily global art market news in 122 countries and 11 languages.With Artprice News®  Artprice is supplementing the weekly publication of its ArtMarket Insight® with a daily global news feed that runs 24/7.This initiative will allow Artprice by Artmarket to suplement its famous annual reports with the analysis of its proprietary AI tool  Intuitive ArtMarket®  and its partnership with Perplexity AI  giving users access to an unfathomable volume of data and parameters in its proprietary AI application  Blind Spot®.Artprice – which owns the world's largest collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues dating back to 1700 – is currently absorbing a colossal volume of historical information into its proprietary AI  Intuitive Artmarket®. This data will be tokenized for use in the next Global Art Market Annual Report (the 32nd edition) to be published in March 2026. Loyal readers will therefore have access to a whole new world.Incidentally  in response to a request by Artmarket.com's board of auditors  Artprice's collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues has recently (January 2025) been valued at 43 million euros  and it is of course  the primary foundation for Artprice by Artmarket's proprietary AI tools.Artprice's annual art market reports are now capable of highlighting extremely complex transversal artistic trends which largely escape the academic  institutional  and commercial spheres.A fractured top and bottom?One quarter of global art auction turnover may have evaporated in a single year  but the auction market has never been so busy: auction houses have in fact recorded a record number of transactions for Contemporary Art.A premium segment running out of steam  but with far more artists  more lots on offer and more traffic than ever.Over the past year  works by tens of thousands of contemporary artists have been sold through auctions around the world  and the scope of acquisition possibilities has never been broader. One in five of these artists was new to the auction market  and many of these were under forty years old. A new generation is therefore emerging  tracing the contours of tomorrow's market.The art market's affordable segment (under $5 000 or even under $1 000) is continuing to grow  fueled by online sales. Cheap and easy to access  this segment is attracting a young  connected clientele hungry for works in tune with their times and concerns  in line with their vision of a new  multi-polar world  both geopolitically  philosophically  and digitally with AI.According to Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Affordable artworks are experiencing a tsunami of interest. Indeed  this interest prompted us to meet with senior executives of the main global auction houses in NY and Beijing to discuss ways of promoting artworks priced between $5 000 and $15 000 and open up to sales in cryptocurrencies  now conducted mainly by ETFs since 2024  after the United States approved the Bitcoin spot ETF as well as the Ethereum spot ETF.Giants like BlackRock (iShares Bitcoin Trust) and Fidelity now offer these products that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin/Ethereum. They are tradable like traditional stocks and eliminate all technical ownership risks.Almost three years ago  Artprice by Artmarket moved to quote all of its art catalog databases in Bitcoin and Ethereum  including price fluctuations since March 2010 (birth of Bitcoin)  in addition to the 8 international currencies that already existed in our databases. This initiative raised our database consultations in cryptocurrencies from 2% to 36%.Today  this means that the 300 new millionaire art collectors are mostly young computer scientists between 25 and 40 years old who own Bitcoin and Ethereum. These new art buyers are seeking a form of social recognition that they find in the purchase of art  and particularly in digital artworks with the emergence of AI  which represents a genuine paradigm shift in art.Based on its long-nurtured expertise in AI (since 1987 with Groupe Serveur  its parent company  its proprietary AI Intuitive Artmarket® and its recent collaboration with Perplexity) Artprice predicts that compared with today's several hundred generative AI creators  the future will see the emergence of billions of creators of all ages and professions  among whom several million will emerge to radically expand the volume of the art market like never before in its history.At the premium end of the spectrum  the market's powerhouses are marking time: six-digit results have fallen sharply. Hong Kong's art auction turnover is half the average of the last ten years  and the picture is not much better in London and New York.The most powerful marketplaces – the United States  China  and the UK – currently account for more than three-quarters of global art auction turnover. Meanwhile  Paris now stands out as the world's most dynamic capital in transaction volumes  ahead of London and New York.New scenes and new facesOur auction data also reflects the emergence of new scenes and the emergence of new faces. The Japanese scene is confirming its influence beyond Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara. Female artists are reaching important new milestones  breaking records and challenging the long-established hierarchy.As screens of all sizes become increasingly present in our daily lives  the Contemporary Art Market has every opportunity to explode. Digital images  promoted by a multitude of outlets dedicated to digital artworks  now have a quality of definition beyond what the human eye (the sensor) and the brain (the actual generator of the image) can observe. Screens now offer exceptional resolution at a cost that has been divided by ten in just a few years.Moreover  the creation of digital artworks  based on AI prompts  offers artists infinite possibilities without having to learn computer programming (which constituted a real obstacle to artistic creation).The best auction result so far for an AI artwork was hammered for Ai-Da Robot's A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing (2024) on 11 July 2024  fetching $1.1 million at Sotheby's New York.This sumptuous work is a tribute to Alan Turing  a true pioneer of AI  who  thanks to cryptanalysis  deciphered the Nazi Enigma Code  enabling the Allies to win WWII. Prosecuted in 1952 for his homosexuality  Alan Turing was sentenced to chemical castration and decided to end his life by taking cyanide on 8 June 1954. Queen Elizabeth II recognized him as a war hero and granted him a posthumous royal pardon in 2013.Faced with this paradigm shift  auction houses are rethinking their strategies like never before  and  with rare audacity  collectors are redefining their priorities  and young buyers are imposing new codes.Contemporary art is therefore not on hold: it is changing course and paving the way for a more inclusive  more fluid  and more diverse ecosystem.Artprice News ® focus on the fate of blue chips.From the destiny of blue-chip artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Banksy  and Marlene Dumas  to the unexpected breakthrough of new artists via an ever-broadening spectrum of marketplaces and the digital revolution  Artprice's 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report is a dive into the underlying dynamics of a rapidly changing market.A market where every dataset tells a story and where every trend already outlines the contours of tomorrow's market.More than just a statistical inventory  this 31st global report suggests what the future may look like.

To expand this scope  Cellectis developed an editing process using its gene editing technology and kilobase-long circular single-stranded DNA donor templates.Research data show that:CssDNA editing process achieved high gene insertion frequency in viable HSPCs.CssDNA-edited HSPCs show a higher propensity to engraft and maintain gene edits in a murine model than adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-edited HSPCs.These data highlight the strong potential of CssDNA as a universal and efficient non-viral DNA template for gene therapy applications.The research was also presented as an oral presentation at the Homology-Directed Repair: The Path Forward Workshop in Sevilla on October 6  2025.Poster presentation:Title: Comprehensive analysis of TALEB off-target editingPresenter: Maria Feola  Ph.D.  Senior Scientist  Team Leader Gene Editing at CellectisDate/Time: Thursday  October 9  2025 from 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. CETPoster number: P0506TALE base editors (TALEB) are fusions of a transcription activator-like effector domain (TALE)  split-DddA deaminase halves  and an uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI).These recent additions to the genome editing toolbox can directly edit double strand DNA  converting a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) through the formation of an uracil (U) intermediate without the need of DNA break. Base editing has great potential in therapeutic applications. However  being able to avoid potential off-target effects is key toward this goal.To evaluate TALEB safety  Cellectis combined advanced bioinformatic predictions with multiple experimental approaches to investigate potential off-target effects in the nuclear genome of primary T cells.The study found no evidence of biases towards off-site C-to-T editing at sites flanked by CTCF binding sites  a key DNA-binding protein that regulates genome organization and gene expression at genome wide level.These results provide a strong framework for the safe development of TALEB in therapeutic cell engineering  supporting their potential for future nuclear and mitochondrial applications.The poster presentations are now published on Cellectis’ website.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Rothwell’s rivals – a consortium comprising the then Philip Lynch-led One51 holding company and Doyle Shipping; and boomtime developer Liam Carroll – were subsequently forced to sell off their chunky stakes  and crystallise large losses  during the financial crisis to pay down debt.Rothwell never made another tilt at a group that he’s now led for 33 years.However  his stake in ICG has increased significantly over the past decade – from 14.8 per cent to just over 20 per cent  as revealed on Monday.Some of it has been down to stock awards and the exercise of share options. Though Rothwell has cashed in some of these. For example  he sold €3.6 million of stock in March after exercising stock options  earning a profit of €1.1 million in the process.The main driver of the chief executive’s take increase has been through ICG spending more than €136.7 million between the start of 2019 and June of this year  repurchasing and cancelling its own stock.

Illustration: Paul ScottTax on gains made by Irish investors in investment funds is set to be reduced and stamp duty on share trading in public companies worth up to €1 billion will be scrapped  Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said  as he set out to make it easier for individuals to invest.The Minister also signalled in his Budget 2026 speech that he will look at establishing a tax-efficient savings and investment accounts regime as part of a roadmap to be published early next year to encourage investment among individuals.“In recognition of the importance of encouraging retail investment  today I am reducing the tax rate that applies to Irish  and equivalent offshore funds and foreign life assurance  products from 41 per cent to 38 per cent ” Mr Donohoe said.It falls short of a recommendation in a Department of Finance report last year  which said the rate should be aligned with the 33 per cent capital gains tax rate that applies to direct investments from stocks to property.Under current rules  domestic investors in funds must pay a 41 per cent tax on the sale of a fund  irrespective of what income tax bracket they are in  or after eight years – whichever comes first. This is known as the deemed disposal rule.Patricia Callan  director of Financial Services Ireland  said the reduction was “an important first step to address issues in our tax system that disincentivise consumer investment in funds”.“Further steps are needed  however ” she added.[ Budget 2026 Q&A: Submit your questions to our expertsOpens in new window ]Ireland and has become Europe’s main home for exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  a fast-growing fund type that can hold everything from shares that track a stocks index to baskets of bonds or commodities. However  less than 0.9 per cent of the net €781 billion of net wealth of Irish households was held in ETFs in 2019  according to the Central Bank of Ireland.The Minister said removing stamp duty on share trading in Irish companies with market capitalisations of up to €1 billion was “essential to the growth of home-grown businesses especially those aiming to expand internationally”.However  the 1 per cent rate will continue to apply to share trading in larger companies  including the 11 biggest groups on the Irish stock market.The rate was cited by insulation group Kingspan last month as one of the reasons why it is planning to float its advanced building systems unit Advnsys in Amsterdam early next year. To avoid the duty  Advnsys  which is focused on the global data centres boom  is likely to be registered as a Dutch company.Mr Donohoe said the roadmap to “simplify and adapt the tax framework” to encourage retail investment will take into account the European Commission’s recommendation last week that Governments establish tax-efficient savings and investment accounts regimes.Euronext Dublin has been lobbying hard in recent years for the establishment of a savings and investments account regime as it seeks to reboot the Dublin stock market  which has seen a number of company exits and a dearth of flotations in recent years.Irish households currently have more than €160 billion of cash on deposit with banks  about 85 per cent of which is earning little or no interest in current and on-demand deposit accounts  according to Central Bank data.,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.07,neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,True,English,"['stock trading duty', 'Paschal Donohoe', 'funds tax', 'firms', '33 per cent capital gains tax rate', 'advanced building systems unit', 'global data centres boom', 'foreign life assurance', 'important first step', 'income tax bracket', 'Central Bank data', '1 per cent rate', '41 per cent tax', 'investment accounts regime', 'Budget 2026 Q&A', 'growing fund type', 'demand deposit accounts', 'Dublin stock market', 'equivalent offshore funds', 'Financial Services Ireland', 'Irish stock market', 'investments account regime', '38 per cent', '0.9 per cent', '85 per cent', 'direct investments', 'tax system', 'tax framework', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Irish investors', 'Irish households', 'Irish companies', 'retail investment', 'consumer investment', 'public companies', 'Paschal Donohoe', 'Paul Scott', 'Budget 2026 speech', 'Mr Donohoe', 'domestic investors', 'eight years', 'disposal rule', 'Patricia Callan', 'Further steps', 'new window', 'main home', 'home-grown businesses', 'larger companies', '11 biggest groups', 'insulation group', 'Dutch company', 'European Commission', 'recent years', 'company exits', 'investment funds', 'exchange-traded funds', 'share trading', 'tax-efficient savings', 'current rules', 'stocks index', 'net wealth', 'Finance report', 'stamp duty', 'Minister', 'individuals', 'Illustration', 'part', 'roadmap', 'recognition', 'importance', 'products', 'recommendation', 'property', 'sale', 'director', 'reduction', 'issues', 'questions', 'expertsOpens', 'ETFs', 'everything', 'shares', 'baskets', 'bonds', 'commodities', 'less', 'capitalisations', 'growth', 'Kingspan', 'reasons', 'Advnsys', 'Amsterdam', 'Governments', 'establishment', 'number', 'dearth', 'flotations', 'cash', 'banks', 'little', 'interest']",2025-10-07,2025-10-08,irishtimes.com

With nearly 30 years of experience as a World Leader in Art Market Information  we will now be publishing daily global art market news in 122 countries and 11 languages.With Artprice News®  Artprice is supplementing the weekly publication of its ArtMarket Insight® with a daily global news feed that runs 24/7.This initiative will allow Artprice by Artmarket to suplement its famous annual reports with the analysis of its proprietary AI tool  Intuitive ArtMarket®  and its partnership with Perplexity AI  giving users access to an unfathomable volume of data and parameters in its proprietary AI application  Blind Spot®.Artprice – which owns the world's largest collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues dating back to 1700 – is currently absorbing a colossal volume of historical information into its proprietary AI  Intuitive Artmarket®. This data will be tokenized for use in the next Global Art Market Annual Report (the 32nd edition) to be published in March 2026. Loyal readers will therefore have access to a whole new world.Incidentally  in response to a request by Artmarket.com's board of auditors  Artprice's collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues has recently (January 2025) been valued at 43 million euros  and it is of course  the primary foundation for Artprice by Artmarket's proprietary AI tools.Artprice's annual art market reports are now capable of highlighting extremely complex transversal artistic trends which largely escape the academic  institutional  and commercial spheres.A fractured top and bottom?One quarter of global art auction turnover may have evaporated in a single year  but the auction market has never been so busy: auction houses have in fact recorded a record number of transactions for Contemporary Art.A premium segment running out of steam  but with far more artists  more lots on offer and more traffic than ever.Over the past year  works by tens of thousands of contemporary artists have been sold through auctions around the world  and the scope of acquisition possibilities has never been broader. One in five of these artists was new to the auction market  and many of these were under forty years old. A new generation is therefore emerging  tracing the contours of tomorrow's market.The art market's affordable segment (under $5 000 or even under $1 000) is continuing to grow  fueled by online sales. Cheap and easy to access  this segment is attracting a young  connected clientele hungry for works in tune with their times and concerns  in line with their vision of a new  multi-polar world  both geopolitically  philosophically  and digitally with AI.According to Thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Affordable artworks are experiencing a tsunami of interest. Indeed  this interest prompted us to meet with senior executives of the main global auction houses in NY and Beijing to discuss ways of promoting artworks priced between $5 000 and $15 000 and open up to sales in cryptocurrencies  now conducted mainly by ETFs since 2024  after the United States approved the Bitcoin spot ETF as well as the Ethereum spot ETF.Giants like BlackRock (iShares Bitcoin Trust) and Fidelity now offer these products that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin/Ethereum. They are tradable like traditional stocks and eliminate all technical ownership risks.Almost three years ago  Artprice by Artmarket moved to quote all of its art catalog databases in Bitcoin and Ethereum  including price fluctuations since March 2010 (birth of Bitcoin)  in addition to the 8 international currencies that already existed in our databases. This initiative raised our database consultations in cryptocurrencies from 2% to 36%.Today  this means that the 300 new millionaire art collectors are mostly young computer scientists between 25 and 40 years old who own Bitcoin and Ethereum. These new art buyers are seeking a form of social recognition that they find in the purchase of art  and particularly in digital artworks with the emergence of AI  which represents a genuine paradigm shift in art.Based on its long-nurtured expertise in AI (since 1987 with Groupe Serveur  its parent company  its proprietary AI Intuitive Artmarket® and its recent collaboration with Perplexity) Artprice predicts that compared with today's several hundred generative AI creators  the future will see the emergence of billions of creators of all ages and professions  among whom several million will emerge to radically expand the volume of the art market like never before in its history.At the premium end of the spectrum  the market's powerhouses are marking time: six-digit results have fallen sharply. Hong Kong's art auction turnover is half the average of the last ten years  and the picture is not much better in London and New York.The most powerful marketplaces – the United States  China  and the UK – currently account for more than three-quarters of global art auction turnover. Meanwhile  Paris now stands out as the world's most dynamic capital in transaction volumes  ahead of London and New York.New scenes and new facesOur auction data also reflects the emergence of new scenes and the emergence of new faces. The Japanese scene is confirming its influence beyond Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara. Female artists are reaching important new milestones  breaking records and challenging the long-established hierarchy.As screens of all sizes become increasingly present in our daily lives  the Contemporary Art Market has every opportunity to explode. Digital images  promoted by a multitude of outlets dedicated to digital artworks  now have a quality of definition beyond what the human eye (the sensor) and the brain (the actual generator of the image) can observe. Screens now offer exceptional resolution at a cost that has been divided by ten in just a few years.Moreover  the creation of digital artworks  based on AI prompts  offers artists infinite possibilities without having to learn computer programming (which constituted a real obstacle to artistic creation).The best auction result so far for an AI artwork was hammered for Ai-Da Robot's A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing (2024) on 11 July 2024  fetching $1.1 million at Sotheby's New York.This sumptuous work is a tribute to Alan Turing  a true pioneer of AI  who  thanks to cryptanalysis  deciphered the Nazi Enigma Code  enabling the Allies to win WWII. Prosecuted in 1952 for his homosexuality  Alan Turing was sentenced to chemical castration and decided to end his life by taking cyanide on 8 June 1954. Queen Elizabeth II recognized him as a war hero and granted him a posthumous royal pardon in 2013.Faced with this paradigm shift  auction houses are rethinking their strategies like never before  and  with rare audacity  collectors are redefining their priorities  and young buyers are imposing new codes.Contemporary art is therefore not on hold: it is changing course and paving the way for a more inclusive  more fluid  and more diverse ecosystem.Artprice News ® focus on the fate of blue chips.From the destiny of blue-chip artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Banksy  and Marlene Dumas  to the unexpected breakthrough of new artists via an ever-broadening spectrum of marketplaces and the digital revolution  Artprice's 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report is a dive into the underlying dynamics of a rapidly changing market.A market where every dataset tells a story and where every trend already outlines the contours of tomorrow's market.More than just a statistical inventory  this 31st global report suggests what the future may look like.

Now  you’ll say… “you’re like a broken record  you’ve been saying the same things will happen this winter.” What can I do? I’ll say it again: the best is yet to come. And it all started yesterday with Alexis Tsipras announcing his departure from SYRIZA  heading “for new seas ” as he put it — which  translated  means a new party. Or something like that  since lately I’ve been hearing talk of an “electoral alliance of personalities ” Macron-style  though I’m not entirely convinced. I tried teasing my first-class source in the political world by saying “does this ‘new seas’ line hint at…?” But they laughed and replied  “Stop the provocations. Alexis is addressing his old comrades — we’ve been through this. We’re not joining forces with businessmen; no offense  but we’ll keep our independence.”Reactions…Let’s be honest: our leader  the great helmsman Alexis  never goes unnoticed. I’m probably the only one who didn’t issue a statement to attack him. Of course  New Democracy did  PASOK did — and its various warlords individually — as did all the former comrades  who accuse him of causing a split. As if the original “First Time Left” (SYRIZA) hadn’t already fragmented into ten pieces — it’s Tsipras making one more that bothers them. The only one who remained gracious (by nature  anyway) was also the most directly affected: Sokratis Famellos  whose party Tsipras just left. He almost apologized to Tsipras — the man who left SYRIZA!The sauerkraut and the oracle of a new partyLet me remind you that last week Tsipras  still as an MP  participated in the work of the Council of Europe. The mixed parliamentary delegation posted a “family photo” from a dinner held at the ambassador’s residence. In the picture  the former PM was surrounded by Dora Bakoyannis  Theodoros Roussopoulos  George Papandreou  Evripidis Stylianidis  Yiannis Oikonomou  Dimitris Markopoulos  Giorgos Stamatis  Dimitris Mantzos and Nefeli Chatziioannidou. I asked some of those present whether — between the tarte aux oignons (onion tart)  choucroute garnie (sauerkraut with cured meats)  and fine  fruity Alsatian Gewürztraminer — he confided anything about his intentions. The answer was no. They did say  however  that he seemed generally disenchanted with SYRIZA. But they passed on one comment of his that I found revealing. When asked whether he plans to found a party  he said: “A former prime minister starts a party only to become prime minister again.”Why now…Readers ask why he rushed to leave now — does it mean the party launch is coming earlier than the new year? The answer I got was: “He didn’t want to attend Parliament’s opening blessing ceremony as a SYRIZA MP.” Personally  I believe he also wants to be “set up” early  because founding a new party — especially on the Left — is no easy task. (Not that the Right is overflowing with talent either…)The reservoirs…Several opinion polls are currently measuring the potential impact of new parties in formation. In Tsipras’s case  one recent poll found that over 19% of respondents were either certain or inclined to vote for him (8% were solid). Where would Tsipras’s support come from? Roughly  two-thirds of SYRIZA’s 2024 European election voters  40% of the New Left voters  19+% from Plefsi Eleftherias (Course of Freedom)  13% from KKE (Communist Party) and almost 10% from PASOK. Of course  polls are one thing  ballot boxes another…The people of Amalias Street…Tsipras is said to be conducting a thorough screening of potential figures to join his new party. He’s reportedly not eager to rely on current SYRIZA MPs as a base. Later on  when it’s time to compile electoral lists  he will likely include some — under conditions. At his offices on Amalias Avenue  a core team of close associates is in constant contact with him. They include: Michalis Kalogirou (longtime director)  Vangelis Kalpadakis (splits his time between Athens and Vienna)  Giorgos Chouliarakis and Dimitris Liakos (economic team)  Giorgos Vasiliadis (in charge of scouting people).What Maximos Mansion is saying“This is an opportunity for people to remember who Tsipras is  but for us  he’s not the benchmark ” a source from the Maximos Mansion (Prime Minister’s Office) told me about Tsipras’s new venture. Government spokesperson Marinakis reportedly made a jab at Tsipras’s “new seas” phrase  saying “last time  we needed life vests” — but that’s not their official strategy. Obviously  Maximos isn’t going to pretend he doesn’t exist. They’ll keep reminding voters of his record. But based on their research  they believe they shouldn’t revive the Mitsotakis–Tsipras two-party dynamic — that was settled for many voters in the 2023 elections  apart from perhaps ND’s hardcore base.Meeting on special spatial planningMeanwhile  meetings upon meetings are held daily at Maximos on various central issues. Following yesterday’s meeting on water — focusing on urgent interventions needed to prevent Attica from running out in 1.5 years — today’s discussion will concern special spatial plans. Participants include K.M.  Hatzidakis  Papastavrou-Tagaras from the Environment Ministry. The goal is to finalize special spatial plans for renewable energy and tourism by year’s end  though significant pending issues remain for industry  mineral resources  aquaculture  and more.The Saudi Arabian Minister’s Visits and MeetingsSince yesterday  the Saudi Arabian Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources  Bandar bin Ibrahim Al-Khorayef  has been in Greece. He met with Theodorikakos and Papastavrou  while the Minister of Development took him in the afternoon to the Elefsina Shipyards  as Greece is interested in bringing the Saudis into the equation and securing orders for the shipyard. Particularly noteworthy is the breakfast that Theodorikakos is organizing for him today with representatives of the largest Greek companies from the industrial  energy  construction  and other sectors. The Saudi minister controls several hundred billion  so it’s best not to miss these kinds of opportunities…Petralias’s “Glass”Yesterday  after the conclusion of the statements regarding the submission of the draft Budget  Pierr (likely referring to the Finance Minister) smilingly said in a small informal press chat about Petralias:“Some see the glass half full  some half empty. Thanos sees it twice as big ” acknowledging the role of the Deputy Minister  who shapes the final form of economic policy. Let’s not forget  after all  that Pierrakakis and Petralias are the “architects” both of the rent rebate announced at Easter and to be implemented in November  and of the Thessaloniki International Fair measures aimed at supporting the middle class and addressing the demographic issue.Negotiations for Two Organic Product CompaniesLeaving aside the concerns the French situation is causing in the markets  let’s turn to the microcosm of the Greek market  starting with the increased activity surrounding organic product companies. According to market sources  two separate negotiation cases are underway involving two different funds. Neither deal is guaranteed to close  though the one that seems more advanced is Bioagros’s talks with Halcyon Capital  currently at the due diligence stage — which means nothing is finalized yet.On a related note about food  I hear it’s only a matter of days before the acquisition of Kritikos by Masoutis is formally concluded.Euronext’s Plan for the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX)Interesting details emerge from the information memorandum regarding Euronext’s public offer for the Athens Stock Exchange. The memorandum has been published  and any investor visiting Euronext’s website section dedicated to the public offer will experience a kind of “cultural shock” at how direct and clear the information is: it lays out the key facts shareholders need to know  provides step-by-step acceptance instructions  an FAQ section  and more. Now to the essence: Euronext’s plan for the Athens Exchange is to integrate it into its platform and turn it into a hub for company listings from the broader Southeastern European region  under the name “Euronext Athens.” A key role is played by its technological infrastructure — specifically  Euronext’s unified trading  clearing  and post-trading platform — which is planned to be incorporated into the Greek exchange. Euronext expects to achieve annual cash synergies (run rate) of €12 million by the end of 2028  mainly through migrating the Greek trading market to the Optiq platform and harmonizing core functions. The transition of ATHEX’s systems to the unified platform is planned for 2027. Additionally: The CEO of ATHEX will be proposed as a member of the Board of Directors of Euronext N.V. An independent representative of the Greek financial ecosystem will be proposed to join the Euronext Supervisory Board at the 2026 Annual General Meeting. The Hellenic Capital Market Commission will remain the main supervisory authority for Greek markets and will be invited to join Euronext’s College of Supervisors  participating in the overall supervision of the Euronext Group.Key Points of the Public OfferThe acceptance period will last six weeks  until November 17. The exchange ratio is twenty ATHEX shares for one Euronext share. Based on the timetable  and provided there are no changes  the new shares to be issued (the exchange shares) will start trading on Euronext markets on November 24. The total number of exchange shares issued will depend on how many ATHEX shares are finally tendered in the public offer or  if applicable  acquired through the squeeze-out and sell-out rights should the process reach that stage. The information memorandum states that G. Chatzinikolaou and G. Kontopoulos have committed to tender their shares (15 000 and 95 000 respectively). Formally  the offer will be valid if shareholders holding at least 38.76 million shares  or 67% of ATHEX’s total shares  accept it. However  Euronext can consider the offer successful even with 33%  since it has the right  e.g.  five days before the end of the offer  to lower the required threshold. An important factor in the public offer is that as of the end of June  ATHEX itself held 2.5 million treasury shares  corresponding to 4.14% of its share capital. Deutsche Bank is acting as Euronext’s advisor  and Eurobank is the offer’s manager.In the banking brokerages…they’ve seen it allThe above concerns are essentially about the public offer but refer to the official framework for how Euronext will proceed. What is more interesting  however  is what is happening behind the scenes  with the Dark Room offering mental support especially to the staff of the banking brokerage firms… who have seen it all. What preparations they are making  what methods they are inventing so that their clients can easily open foreign accounts in order to receive the Euronext shares  what informational and other types of emails they are sending  etc. etc. In the banking mutual fund management companies (AEDAK)  I imagine there will not be similar mobilization  as only one decision is needed  but the pressure there is also strongly felt. From the side of those who support Euronext’s move  the estimates regarding the outcome of the offer are that it is not considered a done deal  but if the bar is lowered to 51%  it has good chances. On the opposite side  the… unruly ones disagree due to the large participation of private investors in the Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) shareholding structure  and argue that the offer will struggle to gather 50%. Who is right will be revealed on November 17 (note: what a day they picked  too!).The two shipowners who support the Chinese shipyardsDespite Washington’s intense pressure to impose duties on Chinese-built ships docking at American ports  China continues to hold the lead. More than 50% of new global ship orders are directed to Chinese shipyards. This percentage soared during the summer months of 2025: 65% in June and 84% in August. Despite US–China tensions  China’s shipbuilding industry is being supported by new orders from major shipowners  such as George Procopiou and the Norwegian John Fredriksen. G.P.’s Dynacom owns the largest tanker fleet on order in the world  with 55 tankers under construction. If the orders from other companies in the group — bulkers and gas carriers — are added  the total number of ships under construction reaches 83.The (double) vote of the chairmanAnd since the subject came up  let me add that G. Procopiou leaves nothing to chance. This is also confirmed by a very recent amendment to the Articles of Association of “Astir Palace M.A.X.E.”  which owns the Astir Vouliagmeni complex. It should be noted that this complex passed into the hands of G. Procopiou at the beginning of the year  with him taking over as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Last week  the amendment of Article 25 of Astir Palace’s Articles of Association was uploaded to the General Commercial Registry (G.E.MI.). This article sets out the provisions regarding member representation  quorum  and majority for the operation of the Board of Directors. According to the Articles of Association  “the company is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of 3 to 15 directors ” while currently the members are 5: G. Procopiou (Chairman)  D. Lampropoulos (Vice Chairman)  H. Pavlou (CEO)  P. Kassi­dokostas–Latsis (Member)  and K. Mitsios (Member). Article 25  which regulates issues of majority  previously provided that “the decisions of the Board of Directors are validly taken by an absolute majority of the directors who are present and those represented.” With the said amendment  however  it was added that “in the event of a tie  the Chairman’s vote prevails.” It is self-evident that the opinion of the owner and Chairman carries decisive weight  but in this case  this “advantage” was also enshrined in the Articles of Association.Greece at the critical IMF SummitThe submission of the 2026 Draft Budget will be the strong card of the Greek government delegation  which  a week from today  will travel to Washington for the IMF and World Bank Annual Fall Meetings. Strong growth rates  fiscal discipline  a spectacular reduction of Public Debt  and reforms will be the key arguments of Finance Minister K. Pierrakakis  Michalis Argyrou (head of the Prime Minister’s Economic Office)  and Dimitris Tsakonas of the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA). At a time when Sovereign Debts have skyrocketed to record levels and two-thirds of the discussions in Washington concern their management  the Greek side will be a useful  positive example. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable has announced it will publish a “playbook” for more predictable and faster sovereign debt restructuring procedures  combined with institutional reforms on the role of international financial institutions in supporting countries’ recovery. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will deliver her key speech on October 8 at the Milken Institute  while the official Plenary Session will be held on October 17.The stockbroker with the blue Porsche who gives advice via TikTokTimes have changed. The Stock Exchange is no longer a taboo. Social media have firmly entered our lives. This is exactly what Mr. Socrates Ch. of Platon seems to believe  who travels with his blue Porsche between Monaco and Luxembourg  and incidentally also gives investment advice. With humor  ease  and confidence  he declares on TikTok which stocks will perform well  what are “the games of the market” at the moment  and he shares — for free  of course — his knowledge with the audience that follows him. In his most recent analysis  he mentioned “the surprise of ELTON Chemicals” as a “hidden card ” which  however  did not work out for him yesterday — just like ONYX — but there is always time for improvement.Drop with low turnover and a pretext from FranceIt didn’t have the strength to reach higher levels  it didn’t have the mood for a major correction  but it found a “golden pretext” in the developments of French political life  which certainly affect the entire Eurozone  to stop and take a breather. The positive start of the General Index lasted only 10 minutes; it didn’t continue  since the European Stock Exchanges started “in the red” as soon as the resignation of the French prime minister was announced. But when the European markets limited their losses  Athens continued downwards  mainly because it didn’t feel like putting up any resistance. The General Index started at 2 082.37 points (+0.30%) and then dropped to 2 049.59 points (–1.31%). It ended the session at 2 053.08 points (–1.14%). The value of transactions remained at €188.2 million  of which €22.08 million were in blocks  because most transactions took place in “heavyweight” stocks. Worth noting is the move by Coca Cola HBC (+0.52% at €38.5)  which after a long time contributed positively to the General Index with trades worth €4.45 million. With transactions worth €28.9 million  Piraeus fell to €7.26 (–2.76%) after the announcement of a €600 million AT1 bond issue  convertible into shares. National Bank (–1.25% at €13.07)  Alpha (–1.33% at €3.70)  and Eurobank (–0.97% at €3.482) reflect the climate of yesterday’s session  affecting the rest of the banking stocks as well. Intralot (€1.178  –4.23%)  after the success of its public offering  rushed to meet the capital increase price (€1.11).The autonomous course of Viohalco’s sharesThe shares of the Viohalco Group kept their distance from the nervousness and the generally poor picture presented yesterday by the Greek stock market. With the majority of stocks “in the red ” Viohalco  ElvalHalcor  and Cenergy Holdings were bright exceptions  continuing their trajectory at levels of historic or multi-year highs. VIO took a decisive step toward conquering €8 for the first time  with its capitalization now exceeding €2 billion. Over the last three days  it has “run” a rally of 7.1%  and this year it has strengthened by 46.5%. A buying party took place in ELHA  which was the blue chip with the strongest rise. With a 4.4% jump  it closed at €3.06  reaching €3.08 at the day’s highs. This is the best close in more than 17 years  specifically since early January 2008. CENER followed with a smaller rise  but it was enough not only to renew its all-time high but also to reach the peak of €13. Over the last five days  it has seen only positive signs  posting cumulative gains of around 8.65%. Its market capitalization stands at €2.77 billion  trailing Titan (€2.86 billion) and Motor Oil (€2.88 billion).The shipowners renovateAfter many years  the Union of Greek Shipowners is proceeding with a substantial renovation of its privately owned offices in Piraeus. Works are underway for a complete refurbishment  with the goal of being ready before the celebration of world shipping — Posidonia — next June. The modernization of the offices includes everything from infrastructure and energy upgrades to the creation of modern  technologically updated workspaces. Until the works are completed  the UGS has moved its services to other offices on Akti Miaouli.Geneva callingIn the glamorous Bâtiment des Forces Motrices hall in Geneva  Kriton Lentoudis of Evalend Shipping was honored as “Shipowner of the Year.” Upon receiving his award  he called on the Greek shipping community to stand “on par with other maritime centers” and to more actively support the work of Mercy Ships — the hospital ships that provide surgical care in poor African countries.Every AI deal sends stocks soaringLate the night before last  New York time  it was announced that OpenAI — the company that brought ChatGPT into our lives — will acquire 10% of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and will develop up to 6 GW of AMD Instinct graphics processors  starting with 1 GigaWatt in 2026. To get a sense of the scale  1 GigaWatt is enough to power hundreds of thousands of advanced computers simultaneously. This infrastructure is necessary for training the next generations of artificial intelligence. Immediately after the announcement  AMD’s share price skyrocketed by +25%  from $165 to $207.35 in a single session. OpenAI will participate as an early design partner in the development of AMD’s next GPU  the MI450. This move breaks Nvidia’s monopoly in the AI processor market. Nvidia had dominated with over 90% market share in AI chips  but AMD — now supported by OpenAI — becomes a serious competitor. The war has just begun.Hydrogen is changing the construction sector in BritainIt is the first attempt. It didn’t take place in a scientific laboratory  but on a real construction site. And it changes all the cost parameters. A huge excavator  a JCB machine  will run not on diesel but on hydrogen. It has already started work at the Lower Thames Crossing — a £10 billion project connecting Kent with Essex. It marks a silent revolution in the construction sector. The excavator is already saving 1.1 tons of CO₂ per month. In Britain  plans are already being developed to completely eliminate oil from construction sites by 2027. The construction industry represents 39% of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions  with heavy vehicles and machinery consuming vast amounts of diesel. The Lower Thames Crossing serves as a testing ground for a new  “green” way of building: low-emission steel  improved concrete methods  and the largest supply of green hydrogen ever made in the UK. Experience so far shows that hydrogen can indeed power heavy equipment under real-world conditions. If the model succeeds  Europe will have a real blueprint for how to build infrastructure without burning its future.,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,mixed,0.17,0.36,0.47,True,English,"['something Macron', 'key figures', 'Saudi minister', 'commotion', 'Alexis', 'party', 'meetings', 'stockbroker', 'Porsche', 'fine, fruity Alsatian Gewürztraminer', 'Mitsotakis–Tsipras two-party dynamic', 'mixed parliamentary delegation', 'opening blessing ceremony', 'Government spokesperson Marinakis', 'special spatial planning', 'special spatial plans', 'various central issues', '2024 European election voters', 'great helmsman Alexis', 'Several opinion polls', 'one recent poll', 'new seas’ line', 'new seas” phrase', 'original “First Time', 'current SYRIZA MPs', 'former prime minister', 'New Left voters', 'various warlords', 'former comrades', 'former PM', 'New Democracy', 'new year', 'new parties', 'new venture', 'many voters', 'same things', 'electoral alliance', 'political world', 'old comrades', 'ten pieces', 'Sokratis Famellos', 'family photo', 'Dora Bakoyannis', 'Theodoros Roussopoulos', 'George Papandreou', 'Evripidis Stylianidis', 'Yiannis Oikonomou', 'Dimitris Markopoulos', 'Giorgos Stamatis', 'Dimitris Mantzos', 'Nefeli Chatziioannidou', 'tarte aux', 'onion tart', 'choucroute garnie', 'one comment', 'easy task', 'potential impact', 'Plefsi Eleftherias', 'one thing', 'ballot boxes', 'Amalias Street', 'thorough screening', 'potential figures', 'electoral lists', 'Amalias Avenue', 'core team', 'close associates', 'constant contact', 'Michalis Kalogirou', 'longtime director', 'Vangelis Kalpadakis', 'Giorgos Chouliarakis', 'Dimitris Liakos', 'economic team', 'Giorgos Vasiliadis', 'life vests', 'official strategy', 'urgent interventions', 'K.M.', 'new party', 'party launch', 'Communist Party', 'broken record', 'first-class source', 'Maximos Mansion', 'hardcore base', 'Alexis Tsipras', 'Newsroom', 'departure', 'talk', 'personalities', 'Macron', 'provocations', 'forces', 'businessmen', 'offense', 'independence', 'Reactions', 'leader', 'statement', 'PASOK', 'split', 'nature', 'sauerkraut', 'oracle', 'work', 'Council', 'dinner', 'ambassador', 'residence', 'picture', 'oignons', 'cured', 'meats', 'intentions', 'answer', 'Readers', 'Right', 'talent', 'reservoirs', 'formation', 'case', 'respondents', 'support', 'two-thirds', 'Course', 'Freedom', 'KKE', 'people', 'conditions', 'offices', 'Athens', 'Vienna', 'charge', 'opportunity', 'benchmark', 'jab', 'research', '2023 elections', 'Meeting', 'yesterday', 'water', 'Attica', '1.5 years', 'discussion', 'Participants']",2025-10-07,2025-10-08,en.protothema.gr
