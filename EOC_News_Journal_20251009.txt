EU leaders and pro-Kiev governments have been attempting to force through a €140 billion ($160 billion) “reparations loan” for Kiev by December  leveraging the frozen Russian assets.Russia has denounced any attempt to repurpose its sovereign wealth as “theft.” Skeptics  such as IMF chief Christine Lagarde  have warned that the move could undermine global trust in the EU’s financial system.Supporters of the plan argue it falls short of outright confiscation  claiming Moscow could eventually agree to repay the loan as part of a future peace settlement.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said last week that his country does not want to be solely responsible for the proposed obligation “if it goes wrong ” and has called for other EU nations to share the potential liabilities.“Belgium has spent three years saying Euroclear is Belgian and so are the benefits ” one senior official told FT. “Now  when it wants to share the risks  it claims Euroclear is European.” Another source argued that the financial risks were “probably manageable.”“There is no more low-hanging fruit ” another EU diplomat told the newspaper  arguing that Brussels needs new funding sources for Ukraine. “Everyone has to do what they can.”According to the FT  De Wever’s reluctance frustrated several EU leaders during last week’s Ukraine-focused summit in Copenhagen.Moscow has accused the EU of sabotaging potential peace efforts  arguing that Kiev’s backers would rather prolong the conflict than admit their strategy has failed.,neutral,0.0,0.85,0.15,negative,0.0,0.42,0.58,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'Belgium', 'FT', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'IMF chief Christine Lagarde', 'future peace settlement', 'one senior official', 'new funding sources', 'potential peace efforts', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'other EU nations', 'Belgium-based Euroclear depository', 'several EU leaders', 'The Financial Times', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine “reparations loan', 'sovereign wealth', 'potential liabilities', 'financial system', 'bloc members', 'multibillion-euro loan', 'war effort', 'pro-Kiev governments', 'global trust', 'outright confiscation', 'three years', 'low-hanging fruit', 'last week', 'Ukraine-focused summit', 'EU members', 'EU diplomat', 'financial risks', 'bloc-backed plan', 'liability', 'Patience', 'refusal', 'collateral', 'Wednesday', 'December', 'attempt', 'Skeptics', 'move', 'Supporters', 'Moscow', 'part', 'country', 'obligation', 'benefits', 'FT', 'newspaper', 'Brussels', 'Everyone', 'reluctance', 'Copenhagen', 'backers', 'conflict', 'strategy']",2025-10-08,2025-10-09,rt.com

Unfortunately  Proactis SA was unable to keep to this timetable  as its statutory auditors were unable to issue their reports on the accounts before the completion of the audit of the accounts of Proactis SA's parent company by the group's UK auditors.Year ended 31 January 2025 – Key Results:The Proactis SA Board of Directors approved the accounts for the year ended 31 January 2025 on 11 September 2025  which have been formally certified by the auditors.€ Million Year ended31 January 2025(12 months)Reported Year ended31 January 2024(12 months)Proforma Period ended31 January 2024(18 months)Reported Revenue 9.3 11.4 17.9 Impairment on intercompany balances and goodwill (0.6) (14.3) (14.3) Net loss (1.1) (15.7) (16.6) Closing cash at balance sheet date 1.1 0.6 0.6 Net cash (outflow)/inflow before net intercompany receipts* (1.1) 0.3 (1.1)(*) This is an adjusted measure and is explained within this report.Prior period results represents an 18-month period; the year-end was changed to ensure alignment with other group companies.RevenuesThe Group revenue has reduced by 18% on a like-for-like basis (using prior year proforma data). This is mainly due to the non-renewal of client contracts at the end of contract. Revenue as presented includes revenue from Group management fees and is split as follows:€ Million Year ended31 January 2025(12 months)Reported Year ended31 January 2024(12 months)Proforma Period ended31 January 2024(18 months)Reported Operating revenue 5.5 6.9 11.3 Group management fees 3.8 4.5 6.6 Total revenue 9.3 11.4 17.9Group management fees are charges to related parties within the wider Proactis Group and include licence fees and recharging of shared resources.During the year-ended 31 January 2025  the company gained a total of €51k of new contracts or increased value from existing contracts  while revenue reduced by €1 095k arising from a loss of customers across both the current and prior periods.As recently disclosed  subsequent to the balance sheet date  revenues have continued to decline in the six month period to 31 July 2025. During this period  revenue declined by 16% to €3.6m. This fall in turnover results from the non-renewal of contracts in certain non-core product lines  which largely incorporates third-party software; and downwards pressure on fees on renewal of contracts.Other operating expensesIn line with the previous year  Proactis SA has recorded an additional impairment of €0.6m on the receivables it is owed from other entities within the group. This brings the total impairment against intercompany receivables to €11.5m (2024: €10.9m). These intercompany balances result from intra-group transfer pricing recharges and are not likely to be repaid in the short term.The Group continues to focus on reducing costs to reflect the declining revenues. Within operating expenses  a reduction is anticipated from our current headcount by approximately 20%  with an expected annualised future cost saving of approximately €1m.CashflowIn the year ended 31 January 2025  the Group generated cash of €0.5m (2024 proforma: €0.5m) however this included the receipt of funding from related parties within the wider Proactis Group of €1.6m (2024 proforma: €0.2m). Excluding these related party receipts  the Proactis SA Group had a net cash outflow of €1.1m (2024 proforma: cash inflow of €0.3m). The Board of Proactis SA continue to monitor the cashflow requirements of the business and ensure that the wider Proactis Group can continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due. This is currently only possible with the on-going support of the Proactis Group.Capital investment remained strong at €1.5m and was focused on the Group’s strategic solution suite: The Business Network. The Group had positive cash balances of €1.1m at 31 January 2025 (31 January 2024: €0.6m).* * * *About Proactis SA (https://www.proactis.com/proactis-sa)  a Proactis CompanyProactis SA connects companies by providing business spend management and collaborative business process automation solutions for both goods and services  through The Business Network.

The commissioning and production process is expected to ramp up through Q4  as the new equipment and process changes are progressively brought to design capacity.The scheduled production pause was within our expected timeframe of three to four weeks and was accounted for in our 2025 production guidance  which we remain on track to achieve. This upgrade work required detailed engineering and project management  with substantial prior planning  and it was completed while maintaining exceptional safety performance. We look forward to WCP A being fully ramped up to its increased capacity by year-end  with WCP A now fully equipped to successfully mine in the large Nataka ore zone  which is the key to Moma’s future production.”Overview of WCP A upgrade projectKenmare has upgraded its largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  representing approximately 70% of its Mineral Resources  and the transition to Nataka will secure Kenmare’s production for decades to come. WCP A will mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which is expected to exceed 20 years.Mining conditions in Nataka are different to Namalope  where WCP A is mining currently. The ore contains higher levels of slimes (ultra fine  clay-like particles)  which can impact feed and recovery rates if not properly managed. Kenmare has upgraded WCP A with two new high-capacity dredges and a new feed preparation module  including an upfront desliming circuit  to effectively manage slimes and increase mining rates  with the objective of delivering consistently stronger Heavy Mineral Concentrate production to its processing operations.The capital cost estimate of the WCP A upgrade project and transition to Nataka remains at $341 million  including a new Tailings Storage Facility and infrastructure in Nataka.Kenmare regularly updates its Projects image library with photographs of the WCP A upgrade project. View the latest photographs here: www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projectsRamp up and transition to NatakaCommissioning of WCP A commenced on 2 October and production will now start ramping up. WCP A is anticipated to be operating at its nameplate capacity of 3 500 tonnes per hour by the end of 2025. WCP A will complete its mine path in Namalope in Q2 2026 and will begin its transition to Nataka from late Q2 2026  which is expected to take approximately 18 months.Kenmare plans to announce its Q3 2025 Production Update on 15 October 2025.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

Positive results from the ALPHAMEDIX-02 phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05153772) showed AlphaMedixTM (212Pb-DOTAMTATE)  an investigational somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-Targeted Alpha Therapy using the lead-212 isotope  met all primary efficacy endpoints and showed clinically meaningful overall response rates (ORR) and prolonged clinical benefits in both peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)-naïve and PRRT-exposed patients with unresectable or metastatic SSTR positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Benefits in key secondary endpoints  including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  were also observed across both cohorts. AlphaMedix™ had a manageable safety profile that was similar across both cohorts.""The positive results from the ALPHAMEDIX-02 study represent a pivotal movement for the Orano Med 212Pb-based platform and underscore the profound potential of lead-212-based radiopharmaceuticals in addressing critical unmet needs for patients with GEP-NETs. We are very encouraged by AlphaMedix™'s consistent and clinically meaningful activity across both peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)-naïve and PRRT-exposed patients ” said Volker Wagner  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer at Orano Med. “These data reinforce our belief that delivering highly potent alpha-emitters directly to cancer cells could potentially offer a meaningful new treatment option for people living with GEP-NETs.”Alpha-emitters are being studied to determine their relative potency and targeted tumor activity compared to current approved therapies. It is believed they could potentially reduce exposure of surrounding healthy tissue due to the short range of alpha particles. In February 2024  AlphaMedix™ was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of PRRT-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic  progressive SSTR-expressing GEP-NETs  recognizing the potential clinical benefits and potential of this lead-212–based therapy.""The promising ALPHAMEDIX-02 results represent a significant step forward  reinforcing the potential of targeted alpha therapy to deliver precise treatment for GEP-NETs ” said Christopher Corsico  MD  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “These data  demonstrating clinically meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile  underscore our unrelenting commitment to developing innovative therapies for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to advancing AlphaMedix™ and working with Orano Med and regulators to bring this important treatment to the GEP-NET community as soon as possible.”The study is ongoing  and the full results will be presented at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The results will also form the basis of discussions with health authorities. AlphaMedix™ has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About the ALPHAMEDIX-02 studyALPHAMEDIX-02 is a phase 2  open-label  multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AlphaMedix™ (212Pb-DOTAMTATE) in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic GEP-NETs  positive somatostatin analogue imaging and at least one site of measurable disease. The study included two cohorts evaluating PRRT-naïve (n=35) and PRRT-exposed (n=26) patients. PRRT-exposed patients had progressive disease after receiving up to four doses of 177Lu-DOTATATE and received their last dose at least six months prior to Day 1. In both cohorts  AlphaMedix™ was administered at 67.6 μCi/kg every eight weeks for up to four cycles (6 mCi maximum per cycle). Primary endpoints included ORR per RECIST1.1 and safety. Secondary endpoints included PFS and OS.About NETsNETs are a heterogeneous group of cancers that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These cancers occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but can also occur in other tissues including the thymus  lung  and other uncommon sites such as the ovaries  heart  and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors. Despite the global prevalence of NETs increasing each year  it is considered a rare cancer that is estimated to affect approximately 35/100 000 individuals worldwide. In the United States  around 12 000 patients annually are expected to be diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors  with an average five-year survival rate of 60% at a metastatic stage.About Orano MedOrano Med is a subsidiary of the Orano Group.
