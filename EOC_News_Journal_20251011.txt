53174,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/626201-eu-fail-agree-russian-assets/,EU could fail to strike deal on frozen Russian assets – media,A plan to give €175 billion to Ukraine may not be agreed at the next European Council due to “political issues ” Euractiv reports Read Full Article at RT.com,A plan to give €175 billion to Ukraine is stuck due to “political issues ” Euractiv has reportedEU member states are unlikely to reach a political agreement later this month on a €175 billion ($190 billion) loan package for Ukraine financed by profits from frozen Russian assets  Euractiv reports  citing several EU diplomats.The proposal  known as the ‘reparation loan’  is backed by Germany  France  and several eastern EU countries  but faces strong resistance from Belgium  which holds most of the immobilized assets. These funds were frozen under Western sanctions following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022.EU member states could fail to strike a deal at the next European Council meeting in two weeks’ time “given the complexity of the matter ” one diplomat told Euroactiv on Friday. Another official said there were still “technical  vehicle  and political issues that need to be sorted out ” warning that the process could take time.Belgium’s Euroclear depository holds around €190 billion in Russian sovereign funds. Profits from matured bonds linked to these funds have piled up at Euroclear  and EU leaders want to use the money to finance a €140 billion reparation loan for Kiev by December. The idea is to avoid directly seizing the Russian assets by instead using the profits they generate to back EU-issued bonds.According to the Financial Times  frustration is mounting among member states over Belgium’s reluctance to approve the scheme. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever recently said his country does not want to shoulder sole responsibility “if it goes wrong” and has urged other EU members to share the risks.Supporters of the plan argue that it falls short of outright confiscation  claiming that Moscow could eventually agree to repay the loan as part of a future peace settlement.The EU has already transferred more than €1 billion from interest on the frozen assets to Kiev  but several countries remain cautious about the legal and financial implications of further measures.Russia has denounced any attempt to repurpose its sovereign wealth as “theft.” European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde has also warned that the move could undermine the euro’s credibility  deter investment  and threaten financial stability.,neutral,0.01,0.73,0.26,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'deal', 'media', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde', 'next European Council meeting', 'several eastern EU countries', 'future peace settlement', 'several EU diplomats', 'other EU members', 'EU member states', 'two weeks’ time', '$190 billion) loan package', '€140 billion reparation loan', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'several countries', 'EU leaders', 'sovereign wealth', 'political issues', 'political agreement', 'strong resistance', 'Western sanctions', 'one diplomat', 'technical, vehicle', 'matured bonds', 'EU-issued bonds', 'Financial Times', 'sole responsibility', 'outright confiscation', 'financial implications', 'financial stability', 'Russian assets', 'Euractiv reports', 'Euroclear depository', 'Ukraine conflict', '€175 billion', 'plan', 'profits', 'proposal', 'Germany', 'France', 'Belgium', 'escalation', 'deal', 'complexity', 'matter', 'Euroactiv', 'Friday', 'official', 'process', 'money', 'Kiev', 'December', 'idea', 'frustration', 'reluctance', 'scheme', 'country', 'risks', 'Supporters', 'Moscow', 'part', 'interest', 'legal', 'measures', 'attempt', 'move', 'credibility', 'investment']",2025-10-10,2025-10-11,rt.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life.1 2Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through a small specialty salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. CMS has approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.3 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

(“Asbury Carbons”) are pleased to announce the signing of a definitive agreement for AMG to sell Graphit Kropfmühl Gm…,Amsterdam  10 October 2025 (Regulated Information) --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) and Asbury Carbons Inc. (“Asbury Carbons”) are pleased to announce the signing of a definitive agreement for AMG to sell Graphit Kropfmühl GmbH (“GK”) to Asbury Carbons  a portfolio company of Mill Rock Capital. The transaction reflects an enterprise value of $65 million.GK operates its own graphite mine at its headquarters in Kropfmühl  Germany  and holds a majority stake in a graphite mine in Sri Lanka. Asbury Carbons will assume all GK operations  including approximately 350 employees. For the twelve months ended August 2025  GK generated $65 million in revenue.With this transaction  AMG completes its exit from the natural graphite business.“The sale of GK highlights AMG’s commitment to proactive portfolio management ” said Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  CEO and Chairman of the Management Board of AMG Critical Materials. “Natural graphite remains an attractive business  but we have not been able to establish GK as a leading supplier to the battery anode market. We are confident that GK will find greater opportunities as part of Asbury Carbons’ graphite portfolio. Meanwhile  AMG will use the proceeds from this transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core growth businesses.”This transaction follows AMG’s repurchase of the remaining 40% interest in GK from Alterna Capital Partners on March 12  2025. The terms of that transaction remain unchanged: the purchase price may be settled by AMG in cash at the end of a three-year period or in AMG shares at any time within those three years  at AMG’s discretion.Headquartered in Asbury  New Jersey  Asbury Carbons is a global leader in carbon-based solutions serving industrial markets  employing more than 300 people across 10 production facilities in North America and Europe.“This combination unites two market leaders in carbon solutions  together representing more than 250 years of history and expertise in the industry ” said Gregg Jones  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Asbury Carbons. “We look forward to expanding our service  strengthening supply chain security and delivering new technologies and solutions to our customers worldwide.”The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals  and AMG and Asbury Carbons expect the sale to close by year-end 2025.This press release contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.This press release contains regulated information as defined in the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world.

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA)  and Medincell (Euronext: MEDCL)  announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UZEDY® (risperidone) as a once-monthly extended-release injectable suspension as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (BD-I) in adults. The approval is based on existing clinical data for UZEDY  coupled with Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) methodologies that leverage previous findings on the safety and efficacy of risperidone formulations already approved for BD-I.UZEDY is the first subcutaneous  long-acting formulation of risperidone that utilizes SteadyTeq™  a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell that controls the steady release of risperidone.1 Therapeutic blood concentrations are reached within 6-24 hours of a single dose.1 For the BD-I indication  UZEDY is now approved with three once-monthly dosing options (50 mg  75 mg and 100 mg).“Adults living with BD-I experience debilitating manic and depressive symptoms  and today’s FDA approval of UZEDY provides a new long-acting formulation of risperidone that may help address existing unmet needs and treatment gaps ” said Chris Fox  Executive Vice President  U.S. Commercial at Teva. “This expanded indication for UZEDY builds on its success in adults living with schizophrenia and demonstrates Teva’s dedication to developing innovative medicines for complex mental health conditions that place a heavy burden on individuals and their caregivers.”An estimated 1% (or 3 400 000+) of U.S. adults will develop BD-I in their lifetime which is associated with poor long-term outcomes and a substantial increase in mortality compared to the general population from both suicide and cardiovascular disease.3“Bipolar I disorder carries profound implications for a person’s life and is linked to suboptimal long-term outcomes  with treatment adherence to daily oral options frequently presenting as a major impediment to effective care ” said Craig Chepke  MD  DFAPA  Medical Director  Excel Psychiatric Associates and Scientific Director  HMP Global’s Psych Congress events and programs. “The FDA’s decision to expand the indication for UZEDY may help those living with BD-I. As a clinician  I am excited to now have a new treatment option for this complex disease.”UZEDY was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults in 2023.2“Long-acting injectables are increasingly recognized as key drivers of innovation in CNS therapeutics ” said Christophe Douat  CEO of Medincell. “We’re proud that UZEDY is now available to support patients living with bipolar I disorder. This milestone highlights the exceptional regulatory and commercial execution of our partner  Teva.”The data reviewed by the FDA to support UZEDY’s approval for the treatment of BD-I includes the Agency’s previous findings of safety and efficacy of past risperidone formulations approved for the treatment of BD-I as well as the efficacy  long-term safety and tolerability of UZEDY for the treatment of schizophrenia which was evaluated in two Phase 3 pivotal studies: TV46000-CNS-30072 (the RISE Study – The Risperidone Subcutaneous Extended-Release Study) and TV46000-CNS-30078 (the SHINE Study – Safety in Humans of TV-46000 sc INjection Evaluation).2About Bipolar I DisorderBipolar I Disorder (BD-I) is a serious mental health condition defined by episodes of mania—periods of abnormally elevated or irritable mood with increased energy and activity—and often episodes of depression. These episodes can cause significant disruptions in thinking  behavior  and daily functioning. It is challenging to diagnose and is often accompanied by other psychiatric comorbidities. BD-I is associated with poor long-term outcomes and a substantial increase in mortality compared to the general population from both suicide and cardiovascular disease. An estimated 1% or 3 400 000+ of U.S. adults will develop BD-I in their lifetime.3About UZEDYUZEDY (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults. In clinical trials  UZEDY significantly reduced the risk of schizophrenia relapse.1 2 UZEDY administers risperidone through copolymer technology under license from Medincell that allows for rapid absorption and sustained release after subcutaneous injection. UZEDY is the only long-acting  subcutaneous formulation of risperidone available in both one- and two-month dosing intervals.1 For full prescribing information  visit https://www.uzedy.com/globalassets/uzedy/prescribing-information.pdf.APPROVED USEUZEDY (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension is a prescription medicine used in adultsfor the treatment of schizophreniafor the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproateIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about UZEDY?UZEDY can cause serious side effects  including an increased risk of death in elderly people who are confused  have memory loss  and have lost touch with reality (dementia-related psychosis).

The term “shipments” describes the volume of vehicles delivered to dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which drives revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending September 30  2025  were an estimated 1.3 million units  a 13% increase y-o-y. Most of the increase was driven by North America  also supported by year-over-year shipment growth in Enlarged Europe and Middle East & Africa.North America posted a particularly strong rebound in Q3  with shipments growing by approximately 104 thousand units compared to the same period in 2024  a 35% y-o-y increase  including the initial deliveries of HEMI® V8-powered Ram 1500. This significant improvement primarily reflects the benefits of normalized inventory dynamics  in comparison to the prior year’s inventory reduction initiative  which temporarily reduced production.Enlarged Europe Q3 shipments increased approximately 38 thousand units  representing an 8% y-o-y increase. This growth was primarily driven by the start of production of four recently introduced B-segment “Smart Car” platform nameplates  Citroën C3  Citroën C3 Aircross  Opel Frontera and Fiat Grande Panda  which were not in production in the prior year period. The benefits of the production ramp-up of these newly introduced products were partially offset by lower shipments of Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) as well as lower shipments in certain high-volume countries.Across Stellantis’ other regions  shipments grew 10 thousand units net in aggregate  representing a 3% increase y-o-y  mainly driven by a 21% increase in Middle East & Africa  partially offset by a modest 3% decrease in South America shipments. The 16-thousand-unit shipment increase in Middle East & Africa reflected primarily increases in Algeria  where local production of FIAT products has been expanding  as well as positive market developments in Türkiye and Egypt. In South America  the modest year-over-year reduction of 7 thousand units in Q3 2025 primarily reflects an unusually high comparison base in Q3 2024  when Stellantis recovered Brazilian shipments that had been delayed by the Q2 2024 flood in Rio Grande do Sul.NOTES(1) Consolidated shipments only include shipments by Company’s consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third parties (dealers/importers or final customers).

I thought to myself  “Now what am I going to do  who will I vote for?” Because  you see  I had decided to go all-in for Alexis. But then I learned that Panoulis has it all figured out: Julie will get 15%  the great helmsman Alexis will get 25%  and bam — there’s your government. What shall we call the new alliance? Hmm  maybe “Julialex” — like SYRIZANEL — or perhaps “BanAlex” (from Banos and Alexis). When I asked my source at the M.M. (Maximos Mansion) for a reaction to this development  I got the feeling those people are in their own world. “Which Julie is forming a party — Alexandra-tou?” they asked  genuinely puzzled. Rumors that Trump’s team has already been approached to allow Kimberly to move to the Julialex Ministry of Foreign Affairs are denied.Did Samaras call Karamanlis?Another source of mine — not from the M.M.  of course — told me that Samaras called Karamanlis (in Rafina) and said  “Kostas  don’t go to Evripidis’ book presentation where Mitsotakis will speak.” But Karamanlis replied that this wasn’t possible  and he didn’t want to create misunderstandings — neither with Stylianidis  nor because it wouldn’t be proper. I’m passing this along as a rumor  since I can’t verify it  but I think it’s a juicy one…And now?Meanwhile  we’re living through small dramas here in Athens. Winter is slowly coming  and the “Indignants reloaded” won’t have much to do. Routsis has started eating again  Gaza seems to be nearing an end  the tent will be gone from Syntagma… what a life!The bill is coming…Let me tell you — the government is looking for a legal formula to charge the return travel costs to the activists who went with the flotilla to break the Gaza naval blockade. Marinakis mentioned it yesterday at the briefing  and when the M.M. looked into it  they realized there’s no legal framework to do that. Also  I understand that in the coming days there will be an effort to tidy up the situation in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier — with all the paints  the lanterns for Tempi  and so on — because  together with Routsis’ tent  the scene looked rather odd.Voridis–Varras Vol. 2Voridis seems determined to skin alive Varras. Yesterday on Open he spent half an hour previewing what’s to come in the Parliamentary Inquiry when Varras is called in. Voridis insists that the real reason for Varras’ resignation wasn’t what’s being implied — that he interfered on behalf of a company in a consultancy tender — but something else entirely. Interestingly  Voridis also revealed that when Varras left OPEKEPE  they asked him to become an advisor to the Presidency  and he agreed. So  there wasn’t a major feud — just a breakdown in communication. As for why Varras is still at the M.M.  Voridis wonders  but the government (through Marinakis) defended him  saying he has no criminal liability — thus responding to Varras — and that if they dismissed him  it would look like a retaliatory firing.The energy issues of the Recovery FundK.M. (Mitsotakis) has decided to focus intensively on the Recovery Fund’s pending projects since the deadline (summer 2026) is approaching. Yesterday at the M.M. there was a meeting with Hatzidakis  Papastavrou  Tsafos  and Papathanasis to discuss the energy files. The main news: the “Apollo” program for energy communities is heading for exclusion from the RRF  and other funding sources will be sought  mainly from the NSRF. There’s already backlash from regional authorities  and next week there’s a scheduled meeting of the regional energy community network about this. They also discussed adjustments to projects on carbon capture and storage (CCS)  wind farms  and the “Exoikonomo” (Energy Efficiency) program.“Gas” for the BOAKIn another meeting with the four construction companies involved in the BOAK highway (GEK TERNA  Aktor  AVAX  METKA) and the Minister of Infrastructure  Dimas  the message from K.M. was clear: regardless of their internal frictions over the concession contract  they must move fast on the sections funded by the RRF — there’s no time to waste. “The Recovery Fund ends in the summer of 2026  and the requirements are strict — this isn’t the NSRF or the Development Law ” was the message from the M.M.  stressing that the project can’t stall.The Telco on paymentsRealizing that if payments to farmers don’t happen soon the “music will start playing ” the government is rushing to meet deadlines. I’m told that every day around 3 p.m. there’s a telco involving Hatzidakis (handling negotiations with the Commission)  Tsiaras (on the farmers and payment action plan)  and Pitsilis from AADE  who will take over OPEKEPE  among others.The crowd at Patelis’ eventOver 300 people gathered yesterday at the National Gallery for Alexis Patelis’ new book — and the mix of guests was quite different from Stylianidis’ book event. From politics  it was mostly ministers and deputy ministers  not many MPs. In the front row  besides K.M.  Mareva  and Sakellaropoulou  I saw Hatzidakis  Skertsos  Kerameus  Zacharaki  Adonis  Dora  Dimas  Mendoni  Michailidou  Efthymiou  Takis Pikrammenos  and others. Bankers like Psaltis  Karavias  Megalou were there too  along with M.M. associates such as Marinakis  Mylonakis  Kontogeorgis  Nezis  Kapi  Zografos  Peloni  Amyras  etc. Among MPs: Staikouras (who knew him as Finance Minister)  Maria Antoniou  Spyros Kyriakis  Nefeli Chatziioannidou  and more. The absence of MPs and the stronger presence of government officials isn’t surprising — Patelis was always focused on work inside the M.M.  not on cultivating ties with MPs. And that’s exactly what his book chapters describe.The Arab Spring of Banks — or Some Headed for Dubai  Others for Abu DhabiGreek banks are experiencing their own Arab Spring — one we hope will yield better results than the uprisings of 2010–2012  which  despite limited political gains  left us with civil wars in Libya and Syria. The systemic banks  aiming to expand their lending portfolios  are now reaching out to Arab countries to participate (with small shares) in large syndicated loans. Eurobank will open a representative office in Mumbai by the end of the year and has already applied for similar offices in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. Piraeus Bank is setting course for Abu Dhabi  while National Bank of Greece  following a management trip  is awaiting approval for a representative office in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia. If the banks’ international expansion up to 2010 focused mainly on the Balkans  this time — with much more cautious and calculated moves — it is centered on the Arab world.Alpha Bank: Strengthening Its London and Luxembourg SubsidiariesAlpha Bank seems to be moving in the opposite direction  although it keeps an eye on the Arab markets through Alpha Bank Cyprus. Its interest in syndicated lending is mainly directed toward the European market (Italy  Spain  etc.) due to its partnership with UniCredit. Within this framework  sources say Alpha Bank’s management has decided to strengthen its London and Luxembourg subsidiaries.Incidentally  note that the semiannual Alpha Bank–UniCredit meeting is just around the corner  where decisions will be made on how to further structure the collaboration between the two banks.Warnings of a Market CorrectionGlobal markets are rising — here in Greece we’ve seen the 2 100-point level — all asset classes are climbing  everything seems fine. Yet  prominent market figures are beginning to issue public warnings that the party cannot last forever. A week ago  Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that equity markets are likely to face a correction after a long rally fueled by artificial intelligence. He recalled the adoption of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s  which led to the dot-com bubble  and predicted a similar pattern this time  adding that “it wouldn’t surprise me if within the next 12 to 24 months we see a correction in stock markets.” Another heavyweight  JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon  told the BBC that he is “much more worried than others” about a serious market correction  which he said could come within the next six months to two years — warning that the risk of a sharp decline in U.S. equities is higher than markets currently reflect. Just two or three days ago  the Bank of England also cautioned that U.S. stock valuations are now similar to those seen near the peak of the dot-com bubble  noting that U.S. Treasuries would be vulnerable to any erosion of the Federal Reserve’s credibility. The Bank concluded that “the risk of a sharp market correction has increased.”CVC Goes to SchoolThe CVC fund has completed a deal with Greek relevance  acquiring a 20% stake in the International Schools Partnership (ISP) — one of the world’s largest international education platforms in primary and secondary schooling. The ISP is already well-known in Greece  having recently acquired three private schools: Platon Schools  the Hellenic-German School  and Avgouleas–Linaras Schools. The deal values ISP at €7 billion  with Partners Group retaining the majority stake. Today  ISP operates 111 schools in 25 countries  educating over 110 000 students. With CVC’s entry  ISP further strengthens its position in the global education market  which continues to attract strong interest from institutional investors.The Sons of Theodoros Angelopoulos Expand Their FleetMetrostar has registered two newly built LR1-type tankers of 75 000 tons each under the Greek flag — the Metro Mistral and Metro Livas. The company  led by brothers Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos  sons of the late Theodoros Angelopoulos  is expected to take delivery of a third new tanker by the end of October  marking the completion of its shipbuilding program. The vessel in question is the Metro Venetian  an Aframax-type tanker with a capacity of 115 000 tons. With the addition of the Venetian  Metrostar’s fleet will total eight tankers  all managed by an affiliated ship management company.Selective Buying by Greek ShipownersThe Greek shipping community continues to play a dynamic role in international ship markets  with recent moves highlighting a strategy to expand fleets with state-of-the-art vessels. New Shipping  owned by Adamantios Polemis  has expanded its presence in the Suezmax segment through new orders at Samsung Heavy Industries  with scrubber-equipped vessels and additional options. In the secondhand market  Greek interests have acquired the Suezmax pair Fairway / Brightway  also with scrubbers  for around $89 million en bloc  as well as the modern Ultramax Andiamo for $30.5 million — reflecting a selective but steady appetite for high-quality  eco-efficient tonnage. Overall  the strategy of Greek shipping interests appears to combine prudent investment in new technologies  selective acquisitions in the resale market  and the sustained renewal and preservation of their fleets.The New Intralot CEO and the Next ChapterOnce again  Socrates Kokkalis and the Intralot management appeared at the Athens Stock Exchange for the ceremonial opening — ringing the bell — after completing a €429 million capital increase  marking the conclusion of the complex merger with Bally’s Interactive. The focus now shifts to how the new corporate structure will move forward  with an international footprint in the iGaming and lottery sectors. At the executive level  Robeson Reeves (CEO and Board Member of Bally’s Corporation)  who attended yesterday’s event  becomes CEO of the new entity. Nikos Nikolakopoulos assumes the role of President and CEO of the Lottery Division  while Chrysostomos Sfatos becomes Chief Financial Officer. Given Bally’s Interactive’s strong presence in online gaming  the new Intralot will seek to expand its B2C operations into new markets. In presentations to analysts during the capital raise  Intralot’s clear message was a strategic pivot toward online gaming. And since the new entity retains Greek DNA and remains listed on the Athens Exchange  many believe that sooner or later  the Greek online gaming market will be part of its roadmap. For now  Intralot’s narrative appears convincing. Despite the flood of 1 263 707 073 new shares entering trading yesterday  the stock held steady at €1.17  with a market capitalization of €2.1 billion. All last week  the “impatient” investors exited to secure gains from the gap between the stock’s market price and the new share issue price of €1.11. Yesterday  however  the “strong hands” that participated in the capital increase and bond placements made their presence felt. The stock closed up 0.86%  with 40.2 million shares traded.Greece and Cyprus: Tangled on Earth (Cable)  United in SpaceWhile the two countries may have gotten their “wires crossed” over a cable project  Greece and Cyprus are moving forward together in space. At the 2nd Hellas Sat Space Symposium  held as part of World Space Week  there was particular interest in the statements of Digital Governance and AI Minister Dimitris Papastergiou and Secretary General for Telecommunications and Post Konstantinos Karantzalos regarding Greek–Cypriot cooperation. Papastergiou emphasized the geostrategic importance of both nations  noting that they have developed joint digital platforms and projects  and that their partnership has not only national but also European significance  fostering digital sovereignty  operational autonomy  and active participation in regional security. Karantzalos highlighted Greece’s role in supporting Cyprus’s admission as an associate member of the European Space Agency (ESA) — a milestone to be formalized on October 22 in Paris. Meanwhile  Hellas Sat CEO Christodoulos Protopappas provided a detailed overview of the capabilities and future prospects of the upcoming Hellas Sat 5 satellite.The U.S. Minister  the Shutdown  and KimberlyThe U.S. government shutdown continues  as the federal budget has yet to be approved. Nearly 400 000 federal employees are not reporting to work and are unpaid. And here’s where it starts to affect us: no one knows whether this situation will further delay the arrival of Ambassador Kimberly in Athens. The answer I get is: “Under current circumstances  yes — it will be delayed. But we don’t know if separate funds exist for such cases.” Meanwhile  on November 6–7  Greece will host the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) conference  which will be attended by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The question is whether Ambassador Kimberly will have arrived in time to present her credentials and welcome the Secretary. There’s also concern that the budget impasse could affect the Secretary’s visit itself. However  I’m told that preparations at the U.S. Embassy in Athens for the ministerial visit are continuing  despite its limited operations.Barrage…Not one  not two  but 11 new companies were established just yesterday by shipowner Stathis Topouzoglou  known for his involvement in the shipping company Prime Maritime Management and in Energean. Since the end of last year  in collaboration with Michalis Chalkias  they founded PrimeHospitality Holdings and Investments S.A.  aiming at participation in other companies  construction activities  short-term rental services  real estate management  and more. At the time of its establishment  shareholders with equal 50-50 participation were Gencorp Management Limited and Novial Company Limited. However  yesterday  Thursday  10 new companies were registered in the General Commercial Registry (GEMI)  under the names Novi Real Estate Investment and Novia Real Estate Investment (with corresponding numbering — I  II  etc.)  each with an initial share capital of €100 000  totaling €1 million. Their purpose: buying and selling real estate  leasing and management services  etc. In all the above companies  headquartered on Agiou Spyridonos Street in Piraeus  the shareholder is Novial Company Limited  while Stathis Topouzoglou undertakes their management. In addition  another company was established yesterday  Homerun Investments S.A.  focusing on capital management services  investment advice  and related activities. The initial share capital amounts to €30 000  of which €18 000 (60%) was contributed by Topouzoglou and €12 000 (40%) by Georgios Saliaris-Fasseas. Mr. Saliaris-Fasseas assumed the roles of Chairman and CEO of the new company  whose board also includes Stathis Topouzoglou (Vice Chairman) and members Eleni-Aphrodite Topouzoglou  Ioanna Topouzoglou  and Vasiliki Tsitziloni.The TITANic transformation in AmericaTitan America has announced that it has finally obtained the much-coveted Miami-Dade County certification for more than 40 lintel (overhead beam) products. This is a development of strategic importance  with significant implications for the TITAN Group on the stock market. Florida’s construction regulations are the strictest in the U.S. The Miami-Dade County approval opens doors to the entire U.S. market. Titan America  moving beyond cement and aggregates  is entering the precast building materials market — one with higher profit margins and access to new sales channels. Florida is experiencing a construction boom  while new hurricane-resilience regulations are driving demand for certified  high-spec materials. The parent company’s share  TITAN  is traded simultaneously on three stock exchanges — the Athens Exchange  Euronext Brussels  and Euronext Paris. In Europe  it trades at an Enterprise Value of about 6.2x EBITDA  while in the U.S. the sector averages 9x EBITDA. Titan America contributes 55–60% of TITAN Group’s total EBITDA  yet the Group’s current market capitalization is under €3 billion  with the stock at €37.2/share.Yiannis fears the beast…With bank shares up 89% since the start of the year  it’s natural that every upward move in the market brings the temptation to cash out and lock in profits. The General Index faces the 2 100-point level with awe — every time it surpasses it  it feels dizzy and alone. That explains yesterday’s €278.89 million in trading volume  of which only €26.1 million were in pre-arranged block trades. Banks were once again the protagonists  but more importantly  a solid base has now been formed for other stocks to follow — as happened yesterday with the refineries  Cenergy (+2.43%  new all-time high at €13.48)  PPC (+2.39% at €14.54)  and others. Motor Oil (+2.02% at €26.26) and GEK TERNA (+1.87% at €22.94)  together with tech firms Profile (+5.82% at €7.64) and Performance (+10% at €7.22)  showed trading volumes promising better days ahead.Free phones and Artificial IntelligenceIt’s not just happening in Greece — it’s happening everywhere. Every respectable telecom operator now announces something related to Artificial Intelligence  and that’s the new reality. Last Monday  Cosmote announced the launch of the new T-Mobile 3rd-generation smartphones  with built-in AI services. Earlier  NOVA had already unveiled its Nova 5G Pro 2 Smartphone and Nova 5G Tab  offered free of charge to subscribers choosing the Unlimited All and Unlimited Talk & SMS + 30GB plans. At the same time  NOVA announced its entry into the “Agentic AI” field. AI Agents are the next evolution of artificial intelligence — systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals  rather than merely respond to questions. At Nova  they believe that Agentic AI will be the catalyst for the future of Telecommunications and ICT (Information & Communications Technology). They call it the “coming of age” of AI. In practice  telecom providers are competing through AI  luring customers with free smart devices on long-term contracts.The U.S. bank merger dance beginsThere are currently 2 160 regional commercial banks operating in the U.S. Two years after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank  which shook public confidence in smaller banks  a major wave of regional consolidation has begun. Last Monday  Fifth Third announced its merger with Comerica  aiming to create the 9th largest banking group in the U.S.  with assets of $288 billion. But this deal is not an isolated case. Earlier  PNC merged with FirstBank. The merger of Pinnacle with Synovus ($8.6 billion) is already in progress  and the Capital One–Discover merger was completed this summer. Regional banks have realized that scale matters. The Big Four (JPMorgan  Bank of America  Wells Fargo  Citi) already enjoy massive advantages in technology  compliance costs  and especially wealth management  which smaller banks simply cannot match. The Fifth Third–Comerica deal has an intense backstory: An activist investor first appeared at Comerica  pressuring the board for a sale and “alternative strategy.” Then Fifth Third made its move — paying for something it had always wanted but couldn’t build organically: a presence in Texas  California  the Southeast  and 17 of the 20 fastest-growing U.S. markets. The secret: Fifth Third isn’t just buying deposits and branches — it’s acquiring core banking systems  data analytics  and payment infrastructures. Smaller banks simply can’t afford the investments required for AI  cybersecurity  and digital banking — hence  they merge.The bitter taste of cocoaEighteen months ago  in April 2024  headlines everywhere reported the explosive rise of cocoa prices to $12 000 per ton. Back then  everyone blamed the climate crisis that devastated crops in West Africa  with droughts and disease cutting production sharply — and fears that chocolate might become unaffordable. Cocoa prices went on a terrifying roller-coaster ride: up +600% in two years  then down –58% in London and –50% in New York. Climate conditions changed. The rains returned to Ivory Coast and Ghana  harvests rebounded  and consumers — who had seen chocolate prices soar — began cutting back. Now  everyone sees that the bubble burst abruptly. But that doesn’t mean cocoa is cheap again: even at $6 000/ton  prices remain double the 20-year average of $2 700. So we haven’t returned to “normal” — only corrected the excess — in a global market where everything is exaggerated.
