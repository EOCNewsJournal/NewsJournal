This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1 2.Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through a small specialty salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. CMS has approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The property covers around 280 000 square metres and was sold to VGP on 9 October 2025 by the insolvency administrator as part of the insolvency proceedings opened in June 2025.The traditional paper mill had been based at the Hagen site for almost 130 years. The city of Hagen  with around 195 000 inhabitants  is located on the edge of the Ruhr area  in North Rhine-Westphalia. The site is located just 20 minutes from the centre of Dortmund  offering excellent accessibility to the wider Ruhr areaVGP plans to gradually transform the site into a modern business and industrial park. The company intends to attract businesses from the production  light industrial and logistics sectors. For the buildings to be developed  VGP is aiming for at least DGNB Gold certification  which recognises particularly sustainable buildings. VGP follows the requirements of the EU Taxonomy and places a special focus on reducing CO₂ emissions already during the construction phase (embodied carbon).VGP is working closely with the City of Hagen and the local economic development agency. Before construction begins  a comprehensive dismantling of the existing buildings and facilities is required  as machinery and production structures are still present on the site.Erik O. Schulz  Mayor of the City of Hagen  says: “We are very pleased that VGP is taking over this traditional site and putting it to a future-oriented commercial use. From the very beginning  we have established a very trusting working relationship with the VGP team. We see great opportunities for new jobs and sustainable value creation in the region through the planned development.”Jan Van Geet  CEO of VGP  also expressed his satisfaction: “With the acquisition of the site of the former paper mill in Hagen  we are laying the foundation to give a traditional industrial location a new future. Our goal is to transform the site into a modern business park – our first in North Rhine-Westphalia – that combines and secures production  logistics and sustainable energy supply.”The site is located at Schwerter Straße 263 in 58099 Hagen  in the district of Kabel. It is situated in close proximity to the A1 motorway (Hagen-Nord exit) and is excellently connected to the regional industrial and logistics network. Located within an established industrial area with existing infrastructure  the site offers ideal conditions for the planned commercial and industrial redevelopment.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions.

Sidetrade  a global leader in AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  announces today that...,Sidetrade reaches a new milestone in its global expansion.Sidetrade  a global leader in AI-powered Order-to-Cash applications  announces today that it has signed binding agreements to acquire 100% of the share capital of EzyCollect  a recognized player in Australia and New Zealand specializing in Order-to-Cash management for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).Already number one in Europe and among the top 3 leaders in North America  Sidetrade is now preparing to expand its footprint to the Asia-Pacific region with ezyCollect  the market leader in Order-to-Cash (O2C) solutions in its domestic market. Together  the two SaaS providers will enable thousands of SMBs across both hemispheres to leverage the power of agentic AI  drawing on a Data Lake whose richness in corporate payment behavior will be unique in the world.“During our visit to Sydney  I was impressed by the expertise and talent of the ezyCollect teams  their forward-thinking vision of the mid-market  and their amazing speed of execution ” said Olivier Novasque  Sidetrade’s founder and CEO. “With ezyCollect  Sidetrade has now all the assets required to achieve its global ambitions. This proposed acquisition opens immediate access to Asia-Pacific  one of the world’s most dynamic economic regions  while enhancing our ability to support the subsidiaries of our multinational clients operating in the area. Beyond geographic expansion  ezyCollect’s SMB total addressable market is huge and represents a tremendous opportunity for Sidetrade’s agentic AI. AI agents will have a massive impact on this segment  where cash is critical  and companies often lack the scale to build specialized Order-to-Cash teams. By combining ezyCollect’s simplicity of deployment and usage with the power of our agentic AI  we aim — together with the ezyCollect teams — to roll out these mid-market solutions across all the regions where we are already operating  marking a major step forward in Sidetrade’s global development.”ezyCollect  the Australian SaaS leader in Order-to-Cash for SMBsFounded in 2014 in Sydney (Australia)  ezyCollect is a leading SaaS player in O2C solutions dedicated to the mid-market. With 53 employees  more than 1 100 client companies representing A$19 billion in B2B receivables managed in its Cloud and about 320 000 debtors  ezyCollect has become the best in class in Australia and New-Zealand and recently began its expansion into the United States.Within just 90 days  ezyCollect clients typically see a 40% reduction in late payments and an 80% decrease in bad debt. The company stands out through:Comprehensive O2C cycle coverage (credit risk management  collections and payment portal);(credit risk management  collections and payment portal); Advanced electronic payment technology   a strong growth driver amid the accelerating digitalization of B2B transactions;  a strong growth driver amid the accelerating digitalization of B2B transactions; Outstanding customer retention for this market segment  with 89% of gross retention   reflecting a solid delivered value;for this market segment  with   reflecting a solid delivered value; Very high business growth  with a 28% CAGR over the past three years.For the 2025 calendar year  ezyCollect expects revenue of approximately A$14 million (around €8 million)  up 28% from 2024. Despite funding its strong growth  the company is nearing operating breakeven (EBITDA break-even) as early as 2025  confirming the strength of its recurring model and cost discipline.In 2026  ezyCollect’s revenue is projected at A$18 million (just over €10 million)  representing expected growth of 29%. Synergies from rolling out ezyCollect’s offerings in all Sidetrade regions (notably Europe and the U.S.)  combined with the integration of Sidetrade’s agentic AI technology into ezyCollect solutions  should significantly accelerate ezyCollect’s revenue trajectory in the coming years.To preserve the entrepreneurial culture and mid-market DNA that have driven ezyCollect’s success so far  its management team will remain primarily responsible  independently from Sidetrade’s enterprise sales force  for leading the go-to-market of the new AI offering  “ezyCollect by Sidetrade ” targeting SMBs in all markets where the Group operates.ezyCollect’s integration into Sidetrade would be effective retroactively as of October 1  2025. Starting next year  the new Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is expected to represent nearly 13% of the Group’s consolidated revenue  further strengthening its international profile. France would then account for only about 25% of consolidated 2026 revenue — a new global balance  a rare achievement for a company of this scale  that will diversify income streams  enhance the Group’s resilience to regional economic cycles  and reinforce the visibility of its mid-term growth profile.Asia-Pacific expansion  extending into SMBs and B2B paymentsThe global O2C solutions market is estimated at US$8.8 billion by 2030  with an average annual growth rate of 12.9% (source: Accounts Receivable Automation Market Size Report  2024-2030  Grand View Research).With this acquisition  Sidetrade will now have a global presence across three continents:Europe   its historical core market;  its historical core market; North America   strengthened by the 2024 acquisition of CreditPoint Software;  strengthened by the 2024 acquisition of CreditPoint Software; Asia-Pacific  with ezyCollect becoming Sidetrade’s regional headquarters in Sydney.This new base will enable Sidetrade to operate seamlessly across all time zones and fully extend its follow-the-sun model on a global scale.ezyCollect: new global distribution channel for Sidetrade’s agentic AIFinance functions are undergoing a revolution. After a decade of algorithmic automation  they are entering the era of AI agents  capable of understanding  learning  and deciding. Sidetrade’s agentic AI  Aimie  pioneered autonomous finance for enterprises: systems that act and self-optimize continuously  without human intervention in certain processes.With this project  ezyCollect would become the first player to bring agentic AI to the mid-market  a segment often constrained by limited resources. ezyCollect adds a client base of over 1 100 companies  growing at nearly 30% annually.By integrating Aimie  ezyCollect customers will gain enterprise-level capabilities without increasing headcount or organizational complexity. Aimie works continuously  like a team member in remote  sending reminders  tracking payments  detecting delays  and adapting to each situation without human input. Where time and staff shortages limit efficiency  agentic AI delivers constant presence  precise execution  and real-time visibility into cash flows.“Joining Sidetrade is a major step forward for ezyCollect and a giant leap for all mid-market companies we already help succeed ” said Arjun Singh  CEO and co-founder of ezyCollect. “We are proud to join forces with the world’s leader in Order-to-Cash  whose advance in agentic AI is unmatched worldwide. With the power of Aimie agents  our clients will benefit from efficiency and intelligence standards previously reserved for large enterprises. This partnership gives us global scale  accelerates our innovation  and preserves our agile DNA and customer proximity.”AI learning on a global scale  from SMBs to multinationalsSidetrade would offer two complementary O2C solutions: Augmented Cash  recognized by Gartner® as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant™ and designed for large enterprises; and ezyCollect by Sidetrade  tailored for the mid-market. Together  they will cover the full O2C spectrum from small businesses to multinationals and combine innovation  geographic coverage  and operational excellence to generate both technological and commercial synergies.“We are delighted to welcome ezyCollect’s team at Sidetrade ” added Olivier Novasque. “This partnership goes beyond geography; it unites two teams that share the same values and the same ambition: to invent the Order-to-Cash of tomorrow. By aggregating proprietary payment-behavior data from the Americas  Europe  and APAC  we will further elevate the intelligence of our Aimie agents to deliver tangible performance  from mid-market firms to global enterprises  around the clock and across time zones.”Sidetrade’s Data Lake  already the largest repository of B2B corporate payment behavior worldwide  analyzing US$7.2 trillion in transactions  will be significantly enriched by APAC mid-market data. This new input will provide Aimie with deeper regional insight into intercompany credit dynamics and enhance the autonomy of its agentic algorithms. In practice  weak signals captured in Sydney or Wellington will inform Aimie’s decisions in Paris  London or Houston - a distributed machine learning loop where each transaction feeds collective intelligence and refines global accuracy  speed  and adaptability.At the heart of the B2B payments revolutionFrom Sidetrade’s perspective  a key technological advancement lies in integrating EzyCollect’s payment digitalization module into its platform. This integration will extend the functional scope of Augmented Cash by adding native payment management capabilities  delivering a fully digitalized end-to-end solution  from order to payment  including e-invoicing and collections.This upcoming feature will position Sidetrade at the forefront of the fast-growing electronic payments wave  a rapidly growing segment that is reshaping the digital customer experience. The goal is to deliver frictionless cash-flow management and pave the way for global monetization of B2B transactions.A major acquisition for SidetradeThe contemplated transaction covers 100% of ezyCollect’s share capital  Sidetrade’s tenth since the Group’s creation  and will also be its largest acquisition in both scale and value. It is marking a strategic turning point in its international expansion.The deal represents an estimated value of around €37 million  including an initial payment upon closing and a potential earn-out based on revenue growth through 2028.Based on ezyCollect’s forecast for 2026  the EV valuation of ezyCollect represents approximately 3.7 times its projected next-twelve-month revenue (NTM)  a reasonable multiple for a fast-growing SaaS player nearing operational profitability  and uncommon within the regional market.The cash component of the contemplated transaction will be financed through a combination of the Group’s available cash resources and a long-term bank loan facility of €25 million  bearing a fixed rate of approximately 3.1% secured through hedging instruments.As a reminder  Sidetrade treasury totaled €48.7 million as of June 30  2025  including €21.5 million in treasury shares  prior to this transaction.This financing structure allows Sidetrade to maintain a solid cash position and capacity for future inorganic growth opportunities  while preserving financial discipline.The acquisition of ezyCollect is expected to close in the next few weeks  subject to customary closing conditions.Sidetrade was advised by King & Spalding LLP (Laurent Bensaid  Julien Vicariot  and Carla De Checchi) as legal counsel. ezyCollect was advised by U.S. investment bank AGC Partners and law firm Thomson Geer.Next financial announcementAnnual Revenue for 2025: January 20  2026 (after the stock market closes)Media relation @SidetradeOli Thornton +44 7933 108 107 oli.thornton@sidetrade.comInvestor relation @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform designed to revolutionize how cash flow is secured and accelerated.

They also include five ministers who previously participated in governments under Macron’s presidency and three people from so-called civil society.By and large  most of the ministers are members of political formations close to the French president  while six come from the Republican Party and are facing the threat of expulsion after that party decided that it supports but does not participate in the government.Motions of censure against the new government  even before it has met and made its programmatic statements  have already been announced to have been submitted to the French National Assembly by the far-right National Rally party of the Marine Le Pen and the radical left-wing party “Fighting France“  of Jean-Luc Mélenchon.For the government to fall  an absolute majority of the members of the National Assembly would have to vote in favor of a motion of impeachment  which will more or less depend on what the Socialist Party does  which is currently seeking to have certain decisions related to the overhaul of the pension system lifted and has said it is awaiting the government’s programmatic statements.At the same time  however  18 deputies from the parties supporting President Macron  from the ecologists  communists and socialists  including former French President François Hollande  have today submitted a proposition in favour of introducing proportional representation in parliamentary elections to the French National Assembly.In their report  the 18 deputies argue that simple proportional representation does not mean nullification  pointing out that from 1958 to the present day France  with the majority system  has seen 47 governments  while Germany  with simple proportional representation  has seen 24 governments.Finally  there is widespread concern in the media and among analysts regarding the impact that prolonged political instability may have on the country’s economy.A typical example is an article in Le Figaro newspaper  which describes with sarcasm and pessimism the current state of France and  by extension  of Europe  comparing it to the Titanic heading for the wreck.Comparison with Greece’s economic crisisThe newspaper draws a parallel between today’s France and Greece in financial crisis  mocking those who insist that “France will never become Greece“  just as they used to claim that the Titanic was “unsinkable”. “Political leaders appear weakened and detached from reality  while the political system is sinking into decadence and cynicism.MPs engage in petty political games  citizens are plunged into apathy  and society seems ready to explode.”In the same vein  the CEO of the Euronext stock exchange group (which manages six European stock markets)  Stephen Bounia  recalled that some European countries were forced to “drastically tighten their belts” as they plunged into crisis and called on Saturday via France Inter radio for these examples to be followed.On Saturday  on France’s radio station  he called on the French government to follow suit.He cited as an example the fiscal performance of Portugal  Italy  Greece  and Spain  which  he pointed out  “have massively reduced their debt” and three of them are now running “primary fiscal surpluses.”,neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,negative,0.0,0.32,0.68,True,English,"['Impeachment proposals', 'new government', 'France', 'Macron', 'parties', 'stability',
