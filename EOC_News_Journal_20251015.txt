The implantable alfapump does exactly that by providing continuous  automated ascites removal that liberates patients from the endless painful paracentesis procedures.”Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  continued: “The presentation at SIR EDGE captured what makes the alfapump so compelling for both physicians and patients  and we are delighted that the alfapump was featured at one of the premier clinical forums for interventional radiology. As we execute our U.S. commercial launch  we’ll continue our goal of showing interventional radiologists how the alfapump represents a modern solution for patients who have had to endure a standard of care that has remained largely unchanged for centuries.”The alfapump system received U.S. FDA Premarket Approval in December 2024 for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is the first U.S. approved active implantable medical device (Class III) that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder. In August 2025  CMS approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting  effective October 1  2025. Sequana Medical expects the first U.S. commercial implants to take place early in the fourth quarter of 2025.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917Media Relations:Jon YuICR HealthcareE: Sequana@icrhealthcare.comT: +1 (646) 677-1855Important Safety InformationIndication for Use: The alfapump® System is intended for single patient use only in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical’s POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1 2.Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through a small specialty salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. CMS has approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.3 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The ETP under the ticker XLMW is listed on SIX  Euronext  and will soon list on Germany’s Xetra exchange. The ETP’s custody is held at Swissquote and Coinbase  with no staking or lending. Glo…,WisdomTree launches low-cost  physically backed Stellar Lumens ETP.The ETP under the ticker XLMW is listed on SIX  Euronext  and will soon list on Germany’s Xetra exchange.The ETP’s custody is held at Swissquote and Coinbase  with no staking or lending.Global asset manager WisdomTree has launched a new physically backed exchange-traded product (ETP) tied to Stellar Lumens (XLM)  marking a significant step in the company’s expansion beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products.The move strengthens WisdomTree’s position as one of Europe’s leading providers of institutional-grade crypto investment vehicles and signals growing institutional interest in blockchain networks beyond the market’s largest digital assets.The ETP expands institutional access to Stellar (XLM)The new product  officially named WisdomTree Physical Stellar Lumens ETP (ticker: XLMW)  offers investors regulated  transparent  and cost-efficient access to Stellar Lumens.The ETP carries an annual management fee of 0.50%  which WisdomTree says is the lowest among physically backed Lumens products available in Europe.It is listed on multiple major exchanges  including the Swiss SIX Exchange  Euronext Paris  and Euronext Amsterdam  and will debut on Germany’s Xetra on October 15.Each share of the ETP is backed by physical Lumens held in cold storage  with custody managed by Swissquote Bank Ltd and Coinbase Custody Trust.The product’s structure mirrors that of traditional commodity ETPs  providing price exposure to XLM without involving staking or coin lending.This means investors gain from price movements of Lumens  minus the 0.50% management fee  but are not exposed to the additional risks associated with validator operations or yield-based products.Risks and market considerationsWhile the XLMW launch broadens institutional access to the Stellar ecosystem  WisdomTree has been transparent about potential risks.WisdomTree has highlighted factors such as Stellar’s inherent volatility  technical disruptions  exchange liquidity  and custodian risks.Though the absence of staking reduces off-balance-sheet exposure  investors remain subject to operational and currency risks  especially since the ETP is quoted in USD but trades in multiple currencies  including EUR and CHF.The product’s Net Asset Value (NAV) is calculated using the CoinDesk Stellar Lumens Price Index at 16:00 London time  offering consistency and simplified price verification for institutional participants.WisdomTree notes that the multi-currency listing structure enhances arbitrage opportunities and tightens spreads  although it may introduce foreign exchange volatility for investors measuring returns in non-USD terms.Bringing Stellar Network into the institutional spotlightWisdomTree’s European CEO  Alexis Marinof  said the launch aligns with the firm’s goal of supporting clients with “innovative  differentiated solutions underpinned by the security  transparency  and product structuring they expect.”The company already manages over $2 billion across 11 physically backed crypto ETPs and has seen strong inflows from investors seeking compliant digital asset exposure.The Stellar network  known for its fast and low-cost cross-border transactions  has established partnerships with more than 69 regulated financial institutions in over 170 countries.Dovile Silenskyte  WisdomTree’s Director of Digital Assets Research  described Stellar as “one of the most established blockchains in the world  focused on solving real-world problems in payments and finance.”She added that Lumens’ fixed total supply of 50 billion tokens reinforces its scarcity and long-term monetary reliability.WisdomTree’s strategic growth and expanding product rangeThe introduction of XLMW comes as WisdomTree continues to expand its European footprint.The company’s European ETF and ETP range recently surpassed $50 billion in assets under management  driven by over $6 billion in net inflows this year alone.Globally  WisdomTree manages about $140 billion across asset classes  reflecting strong investor demand for its innovative and transparent financial products.Beyond crypto  the firm’s success has been fueled by robust demand for thematic funds such as the WisdomTree Europe Defence UCITS ETF  which has gathered more than $4 billion in assets since its 2025 launch.Its UCITS platform now oversees $12 billion  and WisdomTree’s physically backed gold and commodity ETPs exceed $30 billion in combined assets.WisdomTree has also appointed Beena Joseph as Global Head of Human Resources to strengthen its “work smart” model and talent development initiatives.Joseph  who joined WisdomTree in 2014 through the acquisition of Boost ETP  has been instrumental in shaping the firm’s people-first culture and will now lead HR efforts globally to support its continued growth.Her appointment underscores WisdomTree’s belief that strong culture drives performance — a principle echoed in its rapid global expansion and continued development of blockchain-native products such as WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™  which aim to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset economy.As interest continues to grow in alternative digital assets  the XLMW ETP could play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of institutional crypto adoption — one built on structure  compliance  and the same innovation that has long defined WisdomTree’s approach to investment.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.04,True,English,"['Stellar

Upon delivery of this final phase  scheduled for summer 2026  the site will cover 55 000 sq.m  with CO₂ emissions reduced fourfold thanks to Aut0nom® certification.Photo credits: ARGANA new 10-year long-term leaseFor over ten years  CELIO has been operating from Amblainville (60). This town  served by the A16 French highway  is located at the gateway to the Île-de-France region  less than 20 minutes from the ‘Francilienne’ road. Initially covering 31 000 sq.m when it was delivered in 2012  the Amblainville site has since become CELIO’s sole European logistics platform. It was first extended in 2017 with two additional units and is now being expanded again with two more. Ultimately  the site will cover 54 500 sq.m.The brand  specializing in men’s fashion  is thus reaffirming the long-term presence of its operations in Amblainville (60)  having also made significant investments in the site’s mechanization. The joint commitment of both companies will be formalized through a new 10-year firm lease covering the entire site  which will take effect upon delivery of the ongoing extension.Dividing carbon emissions by a factor of 4ARGAN and CELIO have taken this new phase of development as an opportunity to integrate Aut0nom® equipment into the site and significantly improve its environmental performance.A 400 kWp photovoltaic power plant will be installed on the roof  fully dedicated to CELIO’s self-consumption. It will be complemented by storage batteries with a capacity of 250 MWh. Lastly  the gas-powered heating system will be replaced by high-efficiency electric heat pumps. Together  these investments will reduce the site’s annual CO₂ emissions fourfold  even with the extension included.Julie Schaf  Celio’s Supply Chain Director: “The Amblainville logistics site is emblematic of the evolution of our business in two key areas. First  it supports our continued growth with this second extension in just a few years; second  it fully meets our strong environmental ambitions with the site’s transition to the Aut0nom® standard. ARGAN’s agility and support on both real estate and environmental matters are a true added value for us.”Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “This project is a perfect illustration of our DNA as a family-owned company that places client relationships at the heart of its strategy and takes a long-term approach. We continuously invest in our existing portfolio  particularly in improving its carbon footprint.”2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

It covers most of SFR's assets  but excludes  in particular  stakes in Intelcia  UltraEdge and XP Fibre and Altice Technical Services  as well as the Altice group's activities in French overseas departments and regions.This offer corresponds to a total enterprise value of €17 billion for the Altice group assets concerned in France and gives an indicative implied enterprise value for the whole of Altice France of more than €21 billion1.Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange envisage to share out the targeted activities as follows:the B2B business to be taken over mainly by Bouygues Telecom  and by Free-iliad Group;the B2C business to be shared between Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange;the other assets and resources (in particular infrastructure and frequencies) to be shared between Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange  with the exception of SFR's mobile network in less densely populated areas  to be taken over by Bouygues Telecom.The split of price and value would be around 43% for Bouygues Telecom  30% for Free-iliad Group and 27% for Orange.Subject to the seller's acceptance of the non-binding offer  the submission of a confirmatory offer will be conditional upon the completion of due diligence  as well as a financial and operational assessment confirming the assumptions of the indicative offer.The transaction will be subject to prior consultation with the relevant employee representative bodies.

The joint company will rely on Altice group employees.There is no certainty at this stage that this indicative offer will lead to an agreement.About OrangeOrange is one of the leading telecommunications operators worldwide  with a revenue of €40.3 billion in 2024 and 124 600 employees as of June 30  2025  including 68 700 in France.

The rebound in bookings in the third quarter  particularly in the US  points to a gradual return to normal activity over the coming quarters. It is precisely in such demanding times that our teams have always shown their ability to turn constraints into opportunities. Beyond the promising rollout of our two new growth driver for the years ahead  agentic AI and the development of a partner network  Sidetrade has taken a major step toward its global ambitions with the October 13 announcement of the planned acquisition of ezyCollect  a leading Order-to-Cash player in the Asia-Pacific region. This transaction will extend our presence to three continents  open access to a global mid-market of several million companies  and accelerate the large-scale deployment of our AI agents  whose impact on small and midsize businesses will be transformative. Finally  the recent Gold and Silver distinctions from EthiFinance and EcoVadis highlight that AI and sustainability are not opposing forces; they complement each other in value creation. As we enter the final quarter of the year  we confirm our profitable growth objectives for 2025 and look ahead to 2026 with confidence  backed by a stronger-than-ever model and clearly identified growth levers for the years to come.”Q3 2025 Rebound in Bookings (27%) Narrows the Gap at the End of September Compared to the First Nine Months of 2024For the first nine months of 2025  Sidetrade’s new Annual Contract Value (ACV) reached €7.81 million  compared to €8.94 million in the same period of 2024. As announced during the investor presentation on September 18  2025  the expected rebound in Q3 2025 bookings (up 27%)  traditionally the slowest quarter  helped narrow the year-to-date gap compared to 2024 to down 13%  from down 21% at the end of June 2025. Note that 2024 marked a record year for bookings.After a cautious first half of 2025 marked by macroeconomic uncertainty  new projects are gradually picking up momentum  especially in the US. In Q3 2025  new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) rose 20%  while services bookings increased 30%. The rollout of our two growth engines  Sidetrade’s agentic AI and the development of a global partner network  will have a significant impact on next year’s bookings in 2026 and underpin the Group’s long-term confidence.Strong Revenue Growth of 12%  Including 17% in SaaS SubscriptionsSidetrade(€m) First Nine months 2025 First Nine months 2024 Change SaaS Subscriptions 38.7 33.0 +17% Revenue 44.4 39.7 +12%2025 figures are from unaudited consolidated data.Sidetrade continues to deliver sustained revenue growth.

This strong performance underscores Sidetrade’s strong traction among multinational clients.International operations remain a key growth driver for the Group  with 69% of revenue in the first nine months of 2025 generated outside France  reflecting continued expansion and strengthened global footprint.Gold Medal from EthiFinance for Sidetrade  now ranking among the top 15% of high-performing companies evaluated by EcoVadisSidetrade has further strengthened its Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) credentials by ranking among the top 15% of companies assessed by EcoVadis  the global benchmark in sustainability ratings.

It covers most of SFR's assets  but excludes  in particular  stakes in Intelcia  UltraEdge and XP Fibre and Altice Technical Services  as well as the Altice group's activities in French overseas departments and regions.This offer corresponds to a total enterprise value of €17 billion for the Altice group assets concerned in France and gives an indicative implied enterprise value for the whole of Altice France of more than €21 billion1.Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange envisage to share out the targeted activities as follows:the B2B business to be taken over mainly by Bouygues Telecom  and by Free-iliad Group;the B2C business to be shared between Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange;the other assets and resources (in particular infrastructure and frequencies) to be shared between Bouygues Telecom  Free-iliad Group and Orange  with the exception of SFR's mobile network in less densely populated areas  to be taken over by Bouygues Telecom.The split of price and value would be around 43% for Bouygues Telecom  30% for Free-iliad Group and 27% for Orange.Subject to the seller's acceptance of the non-binding offer  the submission of a confirmatory offer will be conditional upon the completion of due diligence  as well as a financial and operational assessment confirming the assumptions of the indicative offer.The transaction will be subject to prior consultation with the relevant employee representative bodies. It will then have to be cleared by the relevant regulatory authorities before it can be completed.At the end of these stages  any assets that cannot be transferred immediately to each of the three operators concerned would be transferred to a joint company responsible for managing operations during a transition period that would notably allow for the gradual migration of customers. The joint company will rely on Altice group employees.There is no certainty at this stage that this indicative offer will lead to an agreement.About OrangeOrange is one of the leading telecommunications operators worldwide  with a revenue of €40.3 billion in 2024 and 124 600 employees as of June 30  2025  including 68 700 in France.

Over the past 10 years  Donegal has returned €96.6 million to shareholders.The IPM deal involves a €16.5 million upfront cash consideration and the possibility of a further €4 million by the end of 2027  subject to certain performance targets being met.It leaves Donegal with just an investment property in Sandyford and in potato seed companies in India and Kenya.Donegal highlighted in a circular on an upcoming extraordinary general meeting on the deal that  following completion  it will become a cash shell company and be required by Euronext Dublin’s junior market rules to complete an acquisition – constituting a reverse takeover – within 12 months. Or face delisting.The Irish market hasn’t exactly been a hotbed of activity in recent years. The last IPO was in late 2021. Since then  a number of companies have exited  including CRH  Flutter and Smurfit Kappa (now Smurfit Westrock).Stockbroking firms will be certain to pitch the Spac idea far and wide.

Now  the professional “Free Palestine” activists may find themselves out of work both abroad and here in Greece — but I’m sure our local ones will quickly find a new cause… perhaps a passionate  single-issue crusade about Tempi.On a more serious note  while Israelis celebrate  so do Palestinians — the images from Gaza and elsewhere speak for themselves.How Dendias Got ItBack to domestic matters — some fresh backstage news about how it was finally decided that the “care” of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier would go to Dendias  rather than Parliament or the Ministry of Culture  since formally any of the three could have taken it.At first  it was suggested (in the Maximos Mansion) that Parliament should take over — but then they thought MPs and some parties (especially the conspiracy-prone ones) would make Nikitas Kaklamanis’ life miserable.Then they considered Mendoni  who’s tough as nails  but someone said  “There’ll always be an excuse that every event there is for ‘cultural reasons’ etc.”In the end  K.M. himself said  “We’ll give it to Dendias.” He picked up the phone and told him directly. I’d add that he also “passed the buck” to him — though I doubt the minister minded much.Delays Because of OLAFBad news for farmers and livestock breeders: yesterday’s OLAF raid on OPEKEPE brings delays of a few days in payments.The fact that OLAF itself showed up at the agency says a lot about the bad mood in Brussels and the level of distrust.On the other hand  the government needs to pay people yesterday.The issue is now in the hands of the usual suspect  Hatzidakis  who has already briefed K.M. about the enormous difficulties — and the risk that the Commission might cut subsidies if the government doesn’t do what Brussels demands.Still  I don’t think the ND MPs quite grasp all this — they’re ready to rumble  belts loosened…“Charged” Meeting Between Tsiaras and ND MPsAt noon on Wednesday  Minister of Rural Development Tsiaras will face ND MPs from farming regions  demanding to know when payments to the agricultural world will begin (some are expected to start this week).Any MP  from any constituency  can attend — though  frankly  they all hear the same complaints from their voters.The atmosphere is anything but pleasant: MPs are under intense pressure  as farmers still have no idea when they’ll see the color of money.Meanwhile  the government is being squeezed by the Europeans  who refuse to release funds without proper guarantees.Ambassador Shuffle in the Diplomatic OfficeA new face is joining the Prime Minister’s Diplomatic Office: Professor of International Relations Sotiris Serbos  who ran for MEP with ND last year and once served as foreign policy advisor to “Leader Nikos” before they fell out over Ukraine.Serbos will be under Miltos Nikolaidis  the current diplomatic advisor  who  I hear  is “warming up” for the post of Greek Ambassador in Paris.That position will soon be vacant since Antonis Alexandridis  the current ambassador  is moving to Washington  replacing Katerina Nasika  who retires at the end of the year.If Nikolaidis indeed moves to Paris  a new diplomatic advisor will have to be found.Restart  Thanks to Piraeus BankWith Eurobank’s acquisition of Eurolife (excluding the general insurance branch)  the column’s curiosity was solved about why the Fairfax team was seen at One & Only in late September–early October.The deal  managed by F. Karavias and A. Sarrigeorgiou  has interesting aspects hinting at what’s to come.Karavias had wanted it for a long time — for years  they say — but since there were ties between the insurance firm and the bank  it was tricky.Word is that talks started moving forward right after Piraeus Bank acquired Ethniki Insurance.Watsa Made a Cool $1 BillionThe big winner from the deal is Prem Watsa  who  with a small investment — made back in the capital control era  when no investor dared come near Greece  not even for tourism — pocketed $1 billion.Eurolife was yielding him €50–70 million annually in dividends  and now he gets the €813 million price tag for 80% of it.Bottom line: Fairfax clears $1 billion in profit.Fairfax “Dresses Up” EurobankFor Eurobank  beyond the obvious (new revenue streams  etc.)  the bank now gains a structure with networks  insurance services  and presence in multiple countries — exactly what European banks are after for cross-selling strategies.In plain English  Fairfax is dressing up Eurobank for sale.People close to Watsa say his Eurobank bet is paying off and he’s in no rush to sell — but  as the Eurolife case shows  Watsa sells gladly when he feels the price is right.Despite assurances of “no intention to sell ” the reality is that Eurobank with an insurance arm becomes even more attractive to a potential investor.The right price will come along — sooner or later.Grivalia Hotels’ Headache (€55 Million in Losses)Karavias and Sarrigeorgiou also come out winners from the deal — the former strengthens his bank (he’s the undisputed boss in the Watsa era)  and the latter  as Fairfax’s executive chairman in the general insurance sector  remains the group’s key man in Greece.Still  not everything is rosy for Eurobank.On Eurolife’s health and life balance sheet sits 47% of Grivalia Hospitality  which isn’t doing well.Last year it posted €55 million in pre-tax losses  and sources — yet to be confirmed — say it’s headed for losses again this year.The Two Fixed References in OPAP’s Mega DealThe Allwyn–OPAP deal  aiming to create a new group with an estimated value of €16 billion — the second-largest publicly listed lottery and gaming company in the world — revolves around two fixed points: first  the Athens Stock Exchange  where the new entity’s shares will continue to trade  and second  Allwyn’s architect  Karel Komárek. The group already operates in over 15 markets across Europe and the U.S.  with further expansion plans in the works.The news of the merger  which broke yesterday morning  caught the market by surprise  and it quickly became clear from the initial announcements that OPAP and Allwyn together are eyeing a much larger slice of the global gaming market. The new structure will feature combined operations of significantly greater scale in terms of revenue  profits  growth  and capitalization. In practice  the merged company will be one of the heavyweights of the Athens Exchange  expected — under current conditions — to become the second-largest listed firm by market capitalization. As for OPAP shareholders  in terms of payout policy  they will be entitled to a €0.50 interim dividend per share (this coming November)  while the new merged company will also pay an additional €0.80 per share for the 2025 fiscal year right after the completion of the transaction.Meanwhile  management intends to maintain a minimum annual dividend of €1 per share from the 2026 financial year onward  along with a dividend reinvestment option (scrip option).The Management’s MessageImmediately following the deal’s announcement  OPAP executives briefed employees  who expressed satisfaction with the new prospects ahead  while agents also responded positively.For them in particular  significant benefits are expected from Allwyn’s planned investments as part of the upcoming rebranding (starting January 2026)  aimed at modernizing and digitizing the retail network. Later yesterday  analysts joined a conference call with senior executives from OPAP and Allwyn  who provided further details from the group’s headquarters on Athens Avenue.Among the key takeaways was that the merged company will be in a strong position to seize new growth opportunities  including potential acquisitions and entry into new markets. Another message sent loud and clear: for Allwyn  Greece is set to be a central hub of its business and digital operations  through major investments and its presence in OPAP  Stoiximan  Kaizen Gaming  and Allwyn Lottery Solutions.Meeting at Maximos on Greece’s Stance Toward the Net Zero FrameworkTrump’s warning that the U.S. will impose sanctions on countries voting in favor of the IMO’s new full decarbonization measures for shipping has set off alarms.Tomorrow at the Maximos Mansion  the Prime Minister has called a meeting with Shipping and Island Policy Minister Vassilis Kikilias and Coast Guard Chief Vice Admiral Tryfon Kontizas to decide Greece’s stance.At the same time  First Deputy Coast Guard Commander Christos Kontorouhas  a veteran IMO expert  departs for London — IMO’s headquarters — where the Special Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee begins tomorrow to discuss and vote on the Net Zero Framework.Sources suggest the vote might be postponed. The issue is that no one yet knows how IMO will manage the vast sums from the CO₂ tax on ships  especially since no viable “green” fuels are available.Postponement is also the Greek shipowners’ proposal  with George Prokopiou recently declaring from Cyprus to IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Rodríguez:“We need to pause. We don’t have to wait for Trump to show us the way — we should chart it ourselves  because we know our business.”“Green Light” for the Trachones ComplexAnother residential complex is moving ahead within the “Little Athens” neighborhood of the Ellinikon redevelopment project by LAMDA Development. The Environment Ministry has given the green light  approving environmental terms for a new seven-building complex  some with ground-floor retail to serve residents in the so-called “Trachones Neighborhood ” named after the nearby stream. The project includes excavation and soil restoration permits for seven new buildings — one single-story commercial building and six five-story residential ones  two featuring shops and restaurants on the ground and first floors — plus an underground parking level  a water feature  eight swimming pools  fourteen hot tubs  and landscaped surroundings.Prices in “Little Athens ” which includes just over 1 100 housing units with stores  vary by complex  starting around €7 500/m² and reaching up to €11 000/m² for the Park Rise complex  designed by Danish architectural firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group).LAMDA Marinas in VeniceSpeaking of LAMDA  its subsidiary LAMDA Marinas will participate in the ICOMIA World Marinas Conference 2025 in Venice (Oct. 15–17) as Official Partner and Gala Dinner Sponsor — the top global event for the marina industry. The company will showcase the Agios Kosmas Marina (part of the Ellinikon project)  the green initiatives at Flisvos Marina  and its vision for the new Mega Yacht Marina of Corfu.CEO Stavros Katsikadis will present in two panels:New Energy Sources for the Green Transition and Vessel Propulsion  explaining how marinas can prepare for the future — highlighting Flisvos Marina’s sustainable upgrades. State-of-the-Art Marinas  where he’ll present the new Agios Kosmas Marina  a landmark part of the Ellinikon redevelopment — Europe’s largest urban regeneration project.Thenamaris of Nikolaos Martinos Achieves a Global First with VenezuelaThe Aframax tanker “Sealeo” (108 000 DWT)  owned by Thenamaris of Nikolaos Martinos  became the first vessel to transport crude oil from Venezuela to the U.S. East Coast after a six-month hiatus.It discharged Boscan crude at PBF’s Paulsboro terminal in New Jersey  under the resumption of Chevron’s shipments from Venezuela  following a new U.S. license.The “Sealeo ” rechartered by Chevron  has since departed for Punta Guaranao  Venezuela.Back from the Dead…Yesterday the column mentioned a company that was founded and dissolved on the same day — Friday  October 10 — after only a few hours. We wondered if the sole shareholder had second thoughts.Well  there’s an update: on Monday  October 13  the same firm  Meli Cordeli S.A.  was re-established. Headquartered on Ermou Street  its purpose is real estate acquisition and management  with an initial share capital of €2 510 000.But here’s the twist: instead of 2 510 000 shares of €1 each (as before)  it now has 25 100 shares of €100 each. This time  capital came not solely from the previous sole shareholder  but split as follows: G.P. contributed €753 000 (7 530 shares – 30%) Another company  controlled and represented by him  contributed €1 757 000 (17 570 shares – 70%) So Meli Cordeli S.A. is back in business — not as a single-member S.A.  but as a regular S.A. As the saying goes  “same John  different Johnny.”Still  for all this fuss — formation  dissolution  and reformation — the change clearly means something.Major Announcements Today from IDEALIDEAL Holdings has invited the press to a business lunch today  and surprises are expected.Reliable sources say that as year-end approaches  revenue is projected to hit €500 million  with operating profits of around €57–58 million. This means investors can look forward to a pre-dividend of €0.10–0.15 per share soon  with the possibility of doubling after the fiscal year’s close.Bought Out the BuyerThe French company EXOSENS  a leader in electro-optical systems (light amplification  detection  and imaging)  had long approached Theon Intl PLC of Kryss Chatziminas seeking to acquire it. Instead  Theon  after listing on the Amsterdam Euronext  quadrupled its value to a €2.4 billion market cap — and flipped the script. It has now reached a definitive agreement with HLD Europe SCA  Invest Prince Henri SCA  and Invest Gamma Sarl (part of Groupe HLD) to acquire a 9.8% stake in Exosens SA for €268.7 million  or €54 per share.Size Does Matter After AllIn less than a week  stock market news has revealed a hidden truth:Ahead of the Greek Capital Market’s upgrade to “developed” status and its integration into the Euronext Group  listed companies need to scale up. OPAP merges with Allwyn creating a €16 billion giant  Eurobank buys Eurolife for €813 million and Intralot absorbs Bally’s Interactive in a €2.7 billion deal. Only by scaling up will Greek companies appear on major institutional investors’ radars. Alpha Bank–Unicredit and Piraeus–Ethniki Insurance showed the way — and more such moves are sure to follow.GEK TERNA and Bank of Cyprus Just a Breath Away from New RecordsDefying the selling trend yesterday  GEK TERNA and Bank of Cyprus moved upward  nearing new peaks. GEK returned above the €23 mark  closing at €23.36  just shy of its year-high of €23.4. Intraday it hit €23.6  a price unseen for 25 years — since January 7  2000  when it closed at €23.99.The stock has gained 5.7% in five days  up 26.4% year-to-date  valuing the group at €2.4 billion. Bank of Cyprus climbed back above €8  closing at €8.12  matching its daily high and nearing its record close of €8.18 (Sept. 29) and intraday record of €8.20 (Sept. 30). It’s on a three-day winning streak  up 3.8% cumulatively  and 76.5% in 2025. The bank’s market cap exceeds €3.5 billion  approaching Jumbo’s €3.8 billion  which would put it in the Athens Exchange Top 10 by capitalization.Big Ships…In the end  Greek shipowners come out on top. Starting today  Trump’s decision takes effect — imposing higher port fees on all ships built in or owned by China. The U.S. now charges $50 per net ton on Chinese ships  rising to $140 by 2028. Naturally  China struck back  imposing 400 yuan ($56) per ton  scaling up to $157 on U.S.-owned ships. Truth is  there aren’t many made-in-USA ships — but there are plenty with American ownership  especially among Wall Street-listed shipping companies. China controls 53.3% of global shipbuilding  the U.S. just 0.1%. Major shipping groups are in panic: many used Chinese leasing structures to finance fleets — now discovering this may make them “Chinese” in the USTR’s eyes. Companies like Seaspan have already moved headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore  while others change flags and renegotiate loans. The extra fees will cost the 10 largest shipping groups $3.2 billion in 2026 — costs that will  of course  be passed on to consumers. For now  the nimble Greek shipowners — whose fleets were built outside China — are the clear winners.,neutral,0.02,0.83,0.15,mixed,0.22,0.15,0.63,True,English,"['unknown soldier', 'ambassador shuffle', 'mega deal', 'Dendias', 'Watsa', 'Karavias', 'Grivalia', 'losses', 'OPAP', 'professional “Free Palestine” activists', 'obvious (new revenue streams', 'International Relations Sotiris Serbos', 'passionate, single-issue crusade', 'foreign policy advisor', 'capital control era', 'civilized Western world', 'fresh backstage news', 'new diplomatic advisor', 'general insurance branch', 'Rural Development Tsiaras', 'current diplomatic advisor', '€813 million price tag', 'new cause', 'new face', 'Bad news', 'agricultural world', 'Diplomatic Office', 'current ambassador', 'insurance firm', 'Ethniki Insurance', 'insurance services', 'insurance arm', 'important day', 'brutal war', 'innocent lives', 'local ones', 'serious note', 'domestic matters', 'Unknown Soldier', 'Maximos Mansion', 'cultural reasons', 'K.M.', 'livestock breeders', 'bad mood', 'other hand', 'usual suspect', 'enormous difficulties', 'Charged” Meeting', 'farming regions', 'same complaints', 'intense pressure', 'proper guarantees', 'Ambassador Shuffle', 'Leader Nikos', 'Greek Ambassador', 'Antonis Alexandridis', 'Katerina Nasika', 'late September', 'A.
