Also on the Group of Seven ministers’ agenda are dis…,The European Union's economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis says G7 finance leaders have agreed to work in a coordinated way on tapping Russian assets to support Ukraine - Copyright AFP Oliver ContrerasBeiyi Seow and Erwan LucasThe EU will urge G7 partners to consider tapping immobilized Russian assets in aiding Ukraine  the bloc’s economy commissioner told AFP on Wednesday  as finance ministers of the group convene in Washington.Also on the Group of Seven ministers’ agenda are discussions on China’s recently announced curbs on rare earths  commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told AFP in an interview.European allies have been working on a plan to provide loans to Ukraine without an outright seizure of Russian assets that have been immobilized after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.“UK and Canada have already indicated willingness to work alongside with the EU’s reparation loan model ” Dombrovskis said.“So  we’re also awaiting more concrete responses from (the) US and Japan ” he added on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank’s fall meetings in Washington this week.He stressed that G7 leaders earlier agreed at the finance ministers level to “work in a coordinated way.”Dombrovskis said he intends to outline the EU’s plans when G7 finance leaders gather  while encouraging partners to see what they can do with frozen assets in their territories. The leaders will also discuss work on further sanctions.Under the European Union’s plan  the EU would borrow funds from international deposit organization Euroclear in Belgium that have matured into cash  and the money would in turn be loaned to Ukraine.The understanding is that any funds Russia pays towards post-war reparations would be used to reimburse the Europeans.The Kremlin has said the EU plan amounts to “theft” and has threatened to retaliate. Meanwhile  Belgium is seeking guarantees that the bloc would share risks on the plan.– ‘We are ready’ –G7 leaders are also expected to discuss potential responses to China  after Beijing recently announced fresh export curbs involving the rare earth industry  triggering a fiery response from Washington.Early Wednesday  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer slammed China’s move as a “global supply chain power grab ” saying that the United States and its allies would not go along with such a system of controls by Beijing.Dombrovskis told AFP that although no concrete decisions have been made at the EU level  “we are ready to engage and to coordinate those approaches  including at the G7 level.”“We are willing to discuss what is the best way to approach it  both in the short-term  but also in the longer term. It’s obvious that we need to work on the diversification of our supply chains ” he said.EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said Tuesday that the EU is coordinating with G7 partners on a response to China’s rare earths export controls  while engaging with China to find solutions.Asked about further progress to seek a reduction in US tariffs targeting EU goods  Dombrovskis noted Wednesday that “there’s a lot at stake economically.”He said he foresees further discussions on sector-specific tariffs  after Brussels managed to negotiate lower duties on auto exports to the United States.– ‘Sizable’ hit –Separately  Dombrovskis noted that a suspension of France’s pension reform would have significant implications  stressing the need for the eurozone’s second-largest economy to ensure it meets its budget commitments.On Tuesday  France’s Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu backed the suspension of the unpopular 2023 reform — a key move to bolster his cabinet’s survival and draw his country out of political crisis.“There are quite sizable fiscal implications ” Dombrovskis said.“So  it’s important that indeed there are measures taken to ensure that France still meets its commitments in line with its medium-term fiscal structural plan ” he added.Freezing the pension reform would cost around 400 million euros ($463 million) in 2026 and 1.8 billion euros the following year  Lecornu previously said.He added that the shortfall should be covered by savings.France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest after Greece and Italy  and is close to twice the 60-percent limit fixed by EU rules.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.0,0.32,0.68,True,English,"['EU economy chief', 'Russia assets', 'G7', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'global supply chain power grab', 'US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer', 'Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu', 'Copyright AFP Oliver Contreras', 'medium-term fiscal structural plan', 'rare earths export controls', 'reparation loan model', 'International Monetary Fund', 'international deposit organization', 'rare earth industry', 'fresh export curbs', 'sizable fiscal implications', 'Seven ministers’ agenda', 'EU trade commissioner', 'The European Union', 'G7 finance leaders', 'commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis', 'supply chains', 'finance ministers', 'US tariffs', 'economy commissioner', 'The Kremlin', 'Sizable’ hit', 'significant implications', 'G7 leaders', 'coordinated way', 'Russian assets', 'Beiyi Seow', 'Erwan Lucas', 'outright seizure', 'concrete responses', 'World Bank', 'fall meetings', 'frozen assets', 'post-war reparations', 'potential responses', 'United States', 'concrete decisions', 'best way', 'longer term', 'Maros Sefcovic', 'sector-specific tariffs', 'lower duties', 'auto exports', 'pension reform', 'second-largest economy', 'unpopular 2023 reform', 'political crisis', '400 million euros', '1.8 billion euros', 'GDP ratio', '60-percent limit', 'G7 partners', 'G7 level', 'European allies', 'EU goods', 'EU rules', 'fiery response', 'budget commitments', 'key move', 'EU plan', 'EU level', 'Ukraine', 'bloc', 'Wednesday', 'group', 'Washington', 'discussions', 'China', 'interview', 'loans', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Canada', 'willingness', 'Japan', 'sidelines', 'plans', 'territories', 'work', 'sanctions', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'cash', 'money', 'turn', 'understanding', 'Europeans', 'guarantees', 'risks', 'Beijing', 'system', 'approaches', 'short-term', 'diversification', 'solutions', 'progress', 'reduction', 'lot', 'stake', 'Brussels', 'suspension', 'France', 'need', 'eurozone', 'Tuesday', 'cabinet', 'survival', 'country', 'measures', 'shortfall', 'savings', 'debt', 'Greece', 'Italy']",2025-10-15,2025-10-16,digitaljournal.com

Cables accounted for approximately 16% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on current EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

The upgraded plant is on track to achieve its nameplate capacity by the end of 2025.We continue to expect to achieve our 2025 production and cost guidance  subject to the ramp up of WCP A progressing to schedule. Ilmenite production is now anticipated to be towards the lower end of the guidance range at 930 000-960 000 tonnes  which is due primarily to the upgrade work starting later in Q3 than expected.Global market conditions remain challenging and one of Kenmare’s customers has indicated that it will be unable to take its contracted volumes in Q4. Besides this  demand for our products remains in line with expectations  with strong  high-value zircon sales volumes expected in Q4.”Q3 2025 overviewImproved Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.02 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: 0.06) – Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A Projects team remains Lost Time Injury (“LTI”)-free since the project’s commencementKenmare continues to expect to achieve 2025 production and cost guidance  although ilmenite production is expected to be towards the lower end of the guidance range at 930 000 to 960 000 tonnesHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 298 400 tonnes in Q3 2025  down 16% year-on-year (“YoY”)  due primarily to lower excavated ore volumes related to WCP A’s production pause to allow upgrade work to take placeIlmenite production of 209 000 tonnes in Q3 2025  down 19% YoY  and primary zircon production of 12 300 tonnes  down 16% YoY  due to a 21% decrease in HMC processed offset by processing of intermediate stockpilesTotal shipments of finished products of 227 400 tonnes  down 25% YoY  due to reduced shipping capacity because the Peg transshipment vessel was in dry dock during Q3 but returned to Moma in late SeptemberWork on hiring a third transshipment vessel has been deferred due to reduced short-term demand  following a customer in financial distress signalling that it will be unable to take contracted volumes  but remains under consideration for 2026Commissioning of WCP A is underway  following upgrade work that was undertaken in Q3  in preparation for mining in the large Nataka ore zone – the capital cost for the projects remains at $341 millionPricing for Kenmare’s products has continued to decline during the quarter  as expected  as the market continues to be over-supplied  however demand for Kenmare’s products was stable in Q3Discussions with the Government are continuing regarding the extension of Moma’s Implementation Agreement (“IA”) - Kenmare remains focused on bringing these discussions to a satisfactory conclusionOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q3 2025 was as follows:Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Q3 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2025 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 8 979 000 11 089 000 -19% 9 119 000 -2% Grade1 4.04% 3.80% 6% 4.45% -9% Production HMC production 298 400 355 400 -16% 358 300 -17% HMC processed 282 800 356 000 -21% 360 900 -22% Ilmenite 209 000 257 400 -19% 245 400 -15% Primary zircon 12 300 14 600 -16% 13 100 -6% Rutile 1 800 2 900 -38% 2 300 -22% Concentrates2 21 300 13 500 58% 10 400 105% Shipments 227 400 302 700 -25% 181 800 25%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and a new concentrates product called ZrTi.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 September 2025 was 0.02 per 200 000 hours worked (30 September 2024: 0.06)  with one LTI incurred in mid-July. Since then  the Moma team has achieved two million hours worked without an LTI and the WCP A Projects team remains LTI-free since the project’s commencement.Sadly  a fatal incident involving a police officer occurred at Moma in late September 2025  as previously announced. The incident appears to have been motivated by theft  with the electrical cable that feeds the pump station stolen. Kenmare continues to support an investigation by the Police of the Republic of Mozambique and has increased security provision at Moma to allow security personnel to work in pairs  where necessary.Kenmare continues to expect to achieve 2025 production and cost guidance  subject to the ramp up of WCP A progressing to schedule. However  ilmenite production is now expected to be towards the lower end of its guidance range at 930 000 to 960 000 tonnes. This is due primarily to the commencement of the production pause at WCP A to allow the upgrade work to take place starting later in Q3 than expected and consequent lower HMC production. Zircon production is not expected to be impacted due to the drawdown of intermediate stockpiles and higher recoveries.HMC production was 298 400 tonnes in Q3 2025  a 16% decrease YoY  due primarily to a 19% decrease in excavated ore volumes  related to the scheduled production pause at WCP A  but benefitting from a 6% increase in ore grades. Additionally  mine recoveries were impacted by the WCP A project and increased oversize material in the feed at WCP B. The downtime at WCP A was partly offset by increased production from Selective Mining Operation (SMO) 1  which is now operating at nameplate capacity.Ilmenite production was 209 000 tonnes  down 19% YoY  primarily due to a 21% decrease in HMC processed  and benefitting from the processing of intermediate stockpiles. Primary zircon production was 12 300 tonnes  down 16% YoY  also due to decreased HMC processed and benefitting from the drawdown of intermediate stockpiles  which contained a higher proportion of zircon than ilmenite. Rutile production was down 38% YoY to 1 800 tonnes  due to reduced HMC processed and lower recoveries. Concentrates production was 21 300 tonnes  up 58% YoY  benefitting from the first commercial shipment of ZrTi  which is a tailings product so only recognised as production when shipped.Total shipments in Q3 2025 were 227 400 tonnes  including a high-value zircon and rutile shipment that was delayed from Q2 and shipped in early Q3. Shipments were down 25% YoY due to Moma operating at 50% shipping capacity. This was because of the temporary absence of one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Peg  which was undergoing maintenance work in its five-yearly dry dock  and returned in late September. Shipments benefitted from Kenmare’s other transshipment vessel  the Bronagh J  delivering a strong performance. Shipments in Q3 2025 comprised 206 900 tonnes of ilmenite  7 000 tonnes of primary zircon  3 700 tonnes of rutile and 9 800 tonnes of concentrates  principally comprising a ZrTi shipment.In early September one of Kenmare’s customers announced that its corporate group had initiated a restructuring or sales process. Consequently  a total contracted volume of 65 000 tonnes of ilmenite  which was scheduled to be shipped in H2 2025  is unlikely to be taken by the customer. Kenmare is looking to place this volume into the market  but sales have not yet been agreed. If the tonnage is not shipped in 2025  total shipments for the year will be broadly in line with production.Kenmare had been exploring an opportunity to rent a third transshipment vessel  which would have the objective of supplementing shipment capacity over the coming months. Due to the reduced short-term demand  the hiring of a third transshipment vessel has been deferred  but it remains under consideration for 2026.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2025 was 32 500 tonnes  compared to 16 900 tonnes at the end of Q2 2025  with the increase due to the reprocessing of intermediate stockpiles in the quarter instead of HMC. HMC is expected to be drawn down in Q4 2025. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2025 was 317 400 tonnes  compared to 300 100 tonnes at the end of Q2 2025  due to production exceeding shipments in Q3 as a result of the lower shipping capacity.Capital projects updateWCP A upgrade projectDuring Q3 2025  significant work was undertaken to upgrade Kenmare’s largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  representing approximately 70% of its Mineral Resources  and WCP A’s transition to this area is essential to securing Kenmare’s production for decades to come. WCP A will mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which is expected to exceed 20 years.Several key milestones were achieved in relation to the WCP A upgrade project in Q3 2025. In July  the two new  high-capacity dredges were safely landed on the beach at Moma and transported by road to the staging pond. Assembly of the new feed preparation module was completed and during a scheduled production pause  WCP A’s existing dredges and feed preparation module were detached from the plant  and the new dredges and new feed preparation module were connected in their place. This process was completed safely and within the expected timeframe and commissioning began on 2 October.The plant will progressively ramp up production during Q4  with its nameplate capacity of 3 500 tonnes per hour expected to be achieved by the end of 2025. WCP A will complete its mine path in Namalope in Q2 2026 and will begin its transition to Nataka from late Q2 2026  which is expected to take approximately 18 months.The capital cost estimate of the WCP A upgrade project and transition to Nataka remains at $341 million  including a new Tailings Storage Facility and infrastructure in Nataka. By the end of 2025  all of the core capital (80% of the total) is expected to have been successfully incurred and deployed  and the project is anticipated to be largely de-risked.Photographs of the WCP A upgrade work can be viewed at www.kenmareresources.com/media/image-library/#projects.Corporate updateImplementation AgreementThe IA governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Although the IA’s original expiry date was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process. Mining operations at Moma are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process.Moma’s IA continues to be a key focus  with the prolonged renewal process remaining a concern. Kenmare’s Managing Director  Tom Hickey  met with the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy in Q3 2025  following his meeting with the President of Mozambique in Q2. Kenmare continues to engage with the Government of Mozambique  while reserving the right to safeguard its contractual entitlements  up to and including arbitration  if an agreement cannot be reached.Market updateDemand for Kenmare’s products was stable in Q3 2025  although globally  demand for mineral sands products softened. Prices for all products weakened compared to Q2 2025 due to supply outweighing demand.Weaker global demand for titanium minerals reflected softer underlying end markets  such as housing and construction  and this continues to weigh on titanium dioxide pigment consumption. Pigment production rates in China were lower in the summer months  while several pigment plants outside of China curtailed or suspended output in response to weak market conditions.Weak market conditions have affected one of Kenmare’s customers whose corporate group has entered a restructuring and sales process. The customer has indicated that it will not take delivery of contracted shipment volumes in H2 2025 and therefore Kenmare is looking to redirect some product sales into the market  with increased risk around pricing and volume. In consequence of this customer’s restructuring and sales process  approximately $9.3 million of invoices for shipments made by Kenmare in Q3 remain unpaid. Kenmare retains title to all material pending payment and is pursuing all avenues to obtain payment in respect of these invoices as well as to preserve its rights and remedies under the contract for both non-payment and loss of contracted volumes.Elevated pigment inventories across the pigment supply chain led to pigment producers reducing production  limiting demand for titanium feedstocks  particularly in China. Pigment inventories in China gradually decreased throughout the summer months and consequently Chinese pigment production and prices have increased in recent weeks after inventories normalised. Demand for titanium sponge  which is used to make titanium metal  remained relatively stable throughout the quarter.Supply of titanium feedstocks continues to exceed demand  negatively impacting market pricing and putting pressure on producers. Domestic Chinese ilmenite production and imports of concentrates remain the largest sources of new supply. Several major producers are understood to be moderating production  however there is less visibility on the response from the small-scale concentrates producers.The zircon market remained subdued in Q3 2025  with limited recovery in end-market demand. In China  increased supply of lower-quality zircon contained in concentrates  combined with a greater willingness among some customers to accept these products  has negatively impacted prices for zircon. However  demand for Kenmare’s high-grade zircon remained stable in China and Europe and the Company continues to expect to sell all of its 2025 zircon production and to finish the year with low zircon inventories.Private investor webinar via Investor Meet CompanyKenmare will host a webinar for private investors via Investor Meet Company at 2:00pm UK time on 16 October 2025.Questions can be submitted before the event via the Investor Meet Company dashboard until 9:00am UK time on 15 October 2025 or at any time during the live presentation.Investors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and register for the Kenmare webinar at:https://www.investormeetcompany.com/kenmare-resources-plc/register-investorInvestors who already follow Kenmare on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

VYVGART® Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa (VYVGART) and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. VYVGART is approved for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and immune thrombocytopenia (Japan only). VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for gMG and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART Hytrulo may be marketed under different proprietary names in other regions.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that binds C2 and blocks activation of both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade. By blocking complement activity upstream of C3 and C5  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation and cellular damage  representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is evaluating empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant  and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months¹  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About AChR-Ab seronegative gMGgMG is a rare  chronic  neuromuscular autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic IgGs targeting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission and debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Approx. 80% of patients with gMG have detectable antibodies against the AChR in sera  and these patients are diagnosed as AChR-Ab seropositive gMG. Approximately 20% of patients with gMG do not have detectable serum antibodies directed against AChR and are referred to as AChR-Ab seronegative gMG. These patients may have detectable autoantibodies targeting other NMJ proteins  such as muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4)  or others. Anti-MuSK antibodies are detected in approximately 1-10% of patients with gMG  while anti-LRP4 antibodies are detected in approximately 1-5% of patients with gMG. About 10% of patients do not have any detectable autoantibodies against AChR  MuSK or LRP4. These triple seronegative patients have historically been excluded from studies and have a higher disease burden and unmet medical need compared to patients with detectable autoantibodies. Currently  there are no approved treatments available for patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies or for triple seronegative patients.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)CIDP is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. There is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can worsen over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  severe  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with the presence of anti-GM1 IgM autoantibodies  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About Idiopathic Inflammatory MyopathiesIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis) are a rare group of autoimmune diseases that can be muscle specific or affect multiple organs including the skin  joints  lungs  gastrointestinal tract and heart. Myositis can be very severe and disabling and have a material impact on quality of life. Initially  myositis was classified as either DM or polymyositis  but as the underlying pathophysiology of myositis has become better understood  including through the identification of characteristic autoantibodies  new polymyositis subtypes have emerged. Two of these subtypes are IMNM and ASyS. Proximal muscle weakness is a unifying feature of each subtype. IMNM is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness due to muscle cell necrosis. ASyS is characterized by muscle inflammation  inflammatory arthritis  interstitial lung disease  thickening and cracking of the hands (“mechanic’s hands”) and Raynaud’s phenomenon. DM is characterized by muscle inflammation and degeneration and skin abnormalities  including heliotrope rash  Gottron’s papules  erythematous  calcinosis and edema.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

I’ve already written to you that the biggest and most difficult problem for the government right now is the payments to farmers  who haven’t received any money for months. Naturally  we’re talking about several hundred thousand of them  who are protesting strongly — not to say boiling with anger. According to my source at the Maximos Mansion  the problem is enormous. The EU absolutely refuses to back down unless the payment system is fully regulated to prevent theft and mismanagement. OLAF will be stationed at OPEKEPE’s offices until Friday. Nevertheless  starting today  payments will gradually begin for the remainder of 2024  even though the deadline for submitting compensation claims for 2025 hasn’t yet expired (it ends on the 20th of the month). From today  payments will also be made for organic crops and beekeeping; on the 28th of the month  some outstanding amounts related to storm Daniel damages  sheep pox  etc.  will also be paid — things I had honestly never heard of before. In total  around €150 million will “drop” — and then we’ll see. Every day at 4 p.m.  Hatzidakis  Tsiaras  Pitsilis  and other officials are dealing with this issue. As the saying goes: run  little legs  run…Kiwis  Daniel  and frayed nervesSo  with farmers’ and livestock breeders’ nerves stretched to the limit due to the significant payment delays  today’s discussion between Minister Tsiaras and ND MPs is expected to be tough. Even inside the Ministry of Rural Development  things are chaotic at times. For example  a source told me that no payment order had been sent to the Finance Ministry for kiwi crops destroyed by Daniel  meaning those people haven’t received a cent in two years. The funny part is that the Ministry of Rural Development has a deputy minister from Larissa (Kellas)  who was appointed to “absorb” tensions from Thessaly. And because there’s a kiwi festival coming up in a region of Larissa  a polite message has been sent to government officials advising them not to show up.The amendment for the Tomb of the Unknown SoldierThe amendment assigning responsibility for the cleaning and maintenance of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the Ministry of National Defense is ready. The Prime Minister’s General Secretary  Stelios Koutnatzis  has prepared the main provisions and penalties  but further coordination with Dendias is needed. Dendias will be in the U.S. today  specifically at the Naval War College in Rhode Island  and also plans meetings in Boston. The amendment may be submitted by the end of the week but will be voted on next week as part of a Ministry of Infrastructure bill.Visit to Attikon HospitalSeizing the opportunity  Mitsotakis wants to get out of the Maximos Mansion as much as possible  schedule permitting. I hear that today he plans to visit Attikon Hospital together with Adonis (Georgiadis) to inspect the renovated ER department — a project funded by the Recovery Fund  which he’s been pushing hard. Whether he’ll also make a brief tour of western Attica will depend on his schedule.Soft Karamanlis?After Samaras’ “tensions” last week  today it’s Karamanlis’ turn (in Rafina) — he’ll speak at an event honoring Anna Psarouda-Benaki at the Old Parliament. His speech  lasting about 15 minutes  will mainly focus on the politician he nominated for Speaker of Parliament in 2004  with only brief references to institutional matters. He will stress that Western societies are facing a growing crisis of trust in institutions and the judiciary  and that it’s a challenge for the political system to bridge this gap. I’m told his remarks won’t be interpretable in light of the Routsis case  and overall the tone will be rather soft. Not that it really makes much difference.Out of Grivalia — Panagiotis PanayiotidisThe atmosphere at Grivalia Hospitality remains tense  with yet another high-profile executive departure. According to information  Panagiotis Panayiotidis — head of Grivalia Developments  the group’s construction arm — left the company on 30/9/25. He had been brought in by former CEO N. Strafthi. The departure was a mutual decision between Chrysikos and Panayiotidis. By the way  the “match” between G. Chrysikos and former CEO N. Strafthi continues. Strafthi is reportedly furious because Chrysikos blames her for Grivalia’s losses  even though she was CEO for only eight months. The dispute may even end up in court. Market chatter says Strafthi is preparing some surprises for Chrysikos — quite likely  since she was his closest associate for over 20 years and knows things firsthand. Grivalia Hospitality is doing better this year (compared to the €55 million losses of 2024)  but the losses haven’t yet been fully closed  and performance still falls far short of Prem Watsa’s expectations. In any case  it’s time for Grivalia to turn the page and focus on the future — especially with demanding projects ahead  such as the Petalioi islands.Forget the Kyriakoulis you knew – Why not?Forget the Kyriakoulis company you knew. The well-known firm active in maritime tourism — chartering leisure boats and managing marinas — is changing its name to Y/KNOT Invest S.A. If you’re puzzled by the new name  the company explains that Y/KNOT has a dual symbolic and modern international character: inspired by the phrase “Why Not?”  it expresses a spirit of innovation and boldness  while “KNOT” symbolizes the connection with the sea  tradition  and continuity of the Group  as well as the links between people  activities  and values. Admittedly  an original name — and in the same spirit  this column could suggest a few catchier ones: be happy  ouzo power  Zorba’s sirtaki  this is Sparta  etc.Greeks gambled €1.67 billion illegally last year (money exists!)Deputy Minister of National Economy and Finance  Giorgos Kotsiras  spoke about a very strict framework for illegal gambling at yesterday’s OPAP Responsible Gaming Conference. The initiative for the new legislative framework had been announced by Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis  following the appointment two months ago of Antonis Vartholomaios as President of the Hellenic Gaming Commission (EEEP). He spoke of a holistic framework aimed at tackling illegal gambling at its root. Beyond protecting society  players  and licensed operators from the illegal market  a crucial role in shaping the measures was played by an EEEP study (a new  updated one is also being prepared). According to it  nearly 800 000 citizens gambled last year on unlicensed websites  in illegal clubs  or underground casinos — with total wagers estimated at around €1.67 billion. This translates to roughly half a billion euros in lost state revenue. Industry experts estimate that with tougher measures against illegal gambling  the state could recoup about half of that — around €250 million — creating new fiscal space for benefits. Among other things  the new legal framework will impose stricter penalties on offenders  immediate and long-term closure and license revocation for premises where illegal gambling occurs  and  particularly for online gambling  decisive action at the payment-network level  in cooperation with all regulatory authorities.The Polemis Family’s Fourfold “Hit” on LandThe Polemis family  one of the oldest and most historic “powers” in Greek shipping  traces its roots to Andros. However  their activities are not limited to shipping  as land-based business ventures are proving increasingly attractive to more and more shipowners. Thus  the branch of the family headed by Spyros Polemis—of Polembros Shipping—along with his children Leonidas and Katerina  made a fourfold “move.” Yesterday  Tuesday  four new companies were registered with the General Commercial Registry (GEMI)  all with land-based activities—though their names still evoke the sea  since they were inspired by sea winds. The “move” is quite significant  since the family of Spyros Polemis is initially investing a total of €5 730 000. Specifically  all four companies are headquartered in a building on Vouliagmenis Avenue and have as their purpose the purchase  sale  and management of real estate and land. The two companies named “Maistros Anemos Single-Member P.C.” and “Zephyros Anemos Single-Member P.C.” have initial share capital of €2 000 000 and €650 000 respectively  divided into shares of €100 each  all contributed by Leonidas Polemis  son of Spyros Polemis  who also assumes their management. At the same time  the other two newly established companies—“Sirokos Anemos Single-Member P.C.” and “Evros Single-Member P.C.”—have initial share capital of €2 500 000 and €580 000 respectively  contributed by Katerina Polemi  who likewise takes over their management. It should be noted that although Katerina Polemi comes from a shipping family  she has made her career in music. She studied at Berklee College of Music in the U.S.  recorded her first album “Spread the Music not the Name” in 2011 to excellent reviews  and has performed concerts worldwide. She has appeared at Carnegie Hall  Boston Symphony Hall  and  in Greece  at the Athens Concert Hall (Megaron Mousikis). She also composed the soundtrack for the film “Little England” by Pantelis Voulgaris.The Koustas SonsNew ventures are not only being pursued by the next generation of the Polemis family  but also by another powerful shipping dynasty. The two sons of Giannis Koustas (of Danaos)  Dimitris and Roberto Koustas  founded in July 2024 a real estate management company called “Akti Kondyli Properties S.A.”  with initial share capital of €3 million  headquartered at the same address as Danaos  14 Akti Kondyli. Yesterday  they proceeded to establish another company  “Sikos Single-Member S.A.”  intended for holding company services. It is also based at 14 Akti Kondyli in Piraeus  with initial share capital of €1 350 000  contributed by Dimitris Koustas. The first Board of Directors consists of Dimitris Koustas as Chairman and CEO  and members Roberto Koustas and Claudine Aimee Carbonaro.Lowering the Fleet’s Average AgeBehind the scenes of Greek shipping  Kostas Delaportas continues quietly with the major renewal of DryDel’s fleet. Ships that others might still consider “new ” such as the 63 600-dwt Andiamo (2019)  have been sold for about $30.5 million  while the 64 500-dwt Utopia (2020)—still under time charter—changed hands for $34 million. The shipowner’s goal is to reduce the average fleet age to under four years  while also taking delivery of five newbuildings over the next twelve months. The new ultramaxes and capesizes ordered from Japanese shipyards reflect his strategy: ships tailored precisely to Delaportas’s standards  replacing older secondhand vessels and taking advantage of strong demand for younger tonnage. In Akti Miaouli  insiders whisper that every move reflects careful capital planning  aiming for a modern  resilient fleet ready to benefit from high freight rates in the coming years.Nikos Tsakos’s “Engine and Tonic” TravelsNikos Tsakos recently embarked on a three-week trip combining business and family matters. He began in London  in familiar surroundings for the family  where he and his associate Sir Efthymios Mitropoulos—former Secretary-General of the IMO—spent considerable time at the International Maritime Organization. Their presence there was linked to supporting London International Shipping Week  a key global event traditionally attended by many Greek shipping families. Tsakos described the atmosphere as “engine and tonic”—dynamic and stimulating—with meaningful exchanges among top industry figures. He then traveled to the United States  where he attended a Greek Orthodox community ceremony blessed by the Ecumenical Patriarch  during which the family prayed for peace and stability in the markets. Returning to London  he participated in the annual event at City University  where he and his son Panagiotis presented topics on shipping to a high-profile audience.Andreas Martinos and Support for the Border IslandsWith an initiative that highlights the social face of the company  Minerva  led by Andreas Martinos Jr  has undertaken to upgrade 11 schools on the island of Kalymnos through the program “Together in the Borderlands.” The result? 1 546 students and 217 teachers now enjoy improved infrastructure  new STEM spaces  creative activity rooms  libraries  and reading corners. At the same time  two kindergartens  two vocational training workshops  and one computer lab were upgraded  while all schools received educational and athletic materials.IDEAL Holdings: Euronext  Free Float  Minion  and AcquisitionsA very interesting response was given yesterday by Lambros Papaconstantinou of IDEAL Holdings  when asked by reporters how he views the upcoming “marriage” of the Athens Stock Exchange with the Euronext Group. After analyzing the obvious benefits for the depth and credibility of the Greek market if it joins a major stock exchange group  Papaconstantinou also highlighted another important point: On large international exchanges  major institutional investors not only look at company size but pay close attention to free float. Specifically  they prefer listed companies where the main shareholder holds a relatively small stake. If there is one main shareholder  it is generally preferable that their stake does not exceed 30%. If there are multiple major shareholders  then 45% is considered the limit. Furthermore  Papaconstantinou put an end to rumors about a possible acquisition of Minion by Attica  and again denied any interest in Vivartia. He stated that IDEAL is focused on industrial sectors and targeted acquisitions in IT and food  aiming to strengthen existing holdings. Finally  he announced that a major acquisition of this scale is expected by the end of Q1 2026.Why Prodea Is in a HurryTomorrow — earlier than any previous year — Prodea Investments (+1.67% at €6.10) will announce its nine-month results. Obviously  the management has something positive to announce (perhaps a pre-dividend?)  which explains why they have moved up the release date  usually set for mid-November. Yesterday  the company’s market capitalization comfortably exceeded €1.5 billion  which is equal to its net asset value based on the June valuation of its properties and yields. In the first half of the year  Prodea’s turnover reached €112.4 million  while profits approached €75 million.Two News Items That Affected AegeanAegean Airlines’ market capitalization fell slightly below €1.2 billion (-0.75% at €13.30)  following two major international developments. The first concerns market reports that EasyJet’s stock appears to be a takeover target by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). If this acquisition materializes  MSC—one of the world’s largest shipping groups—would become a formidable competitor for Aegean  which is currently seeking to expand its reach eastward. Analysts note that merger and acquisition activity in the low-cost airline sector is intensifying  with industry consolidation likely to increase in coming years due to fierce competition and the pursuit of economies of scale. The second piece of news involves the decline in global oil prices  following the International Energy Agency (IEA) monthly report  which cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025 to 710 000 barrels per day—that’s 30 000 barrels fewer than last month’s estimate. This reduction signals weaker global economic activity  but also lowers fuel costs—the largest operating expense for airlines. For Aegean  where jet fuel accounts for 30–35% of total costs  this translates into an immediate improvement in profit margins.Athens Stock Exchange: Sharp Drop with 30 Block TradesAccording to market theory  a large number of block trades during a steeply negative session often indicate a “distribution of weight”—and may foreshadow further declines. Yesterday  total trading volume reached €320.18 million  of which €63.82 million came from block transactions. The key point  however  was the absence of foreign support. Normally  later in the session  Western investment funds enter the market  easing concerns and restoring balance—but not yesterday. The General Index stayed negative throughout the day  plunging to 2 053.77 points (-1.6%) and closing near its lowest level at 2 056.86 points (-1.45%). Apart from OPAP  there were significant declines in banking stocks  which had been the most profitable segment of the market: Piraeus Bank at €7.28 (-2.02%)  Alpha Bank at €3.60 (-2.7%)  Eurobank at €3.61 (-1.01%). National Bank held steady at €13.68  supported by investor expectations of the next major deal. Some support came from TITAN  Lamda Development  GEK TERNA  EYDAP  and Sarantis  all showing small but positive gains. Meanwhile  Intralot (-2.94% at €1.124)  AVAX (-2.7% at €2.34)  and ADMIE (-1.45% at €3.06) added to the day’s gloomy picture.The Silver “Squeeze” of the YearThe silver market is experiencing an explosive liquidity crisis  reminiscent of the biggest short squeezes in history. The annualized overnight borrowing cost for silver has skyrocketed to over 100%  surpassing even the levels seen during the legendary short squeeze of the 1980s (veterans will recall the Hunt brothers) when prices hit $52.50 per ounce. From 2021 to early 2024  silver borrowing rates hovered near zero. Suddenly  in 2024–2025  they have surged—reaching 35% for one-month loans  the highest level in five years. In the physical market  investor demand for a safe-haven asset has surged  the availability of silver bars for trade has plummeted  and demand from India—traditionally a major consumer of precious metals—has exploded. The London market  the global hub for silver trading  has almost completely lost liquidity. There are reports of large air shipments of 15–30 million ounces from New York to London by investors seeking to profit from arbitrage opportunities between the two major markets. For now  silver has become the hottest commodity of the year.,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,mixed,0.12,0.16,0.72,True,English,"['illegal gambling', 'Polemis family', 'business ventures', 'payments', 'farmers', 'difficulties', 'Rafinas', 'departures', 'Grivalia', 'land', 'former CEO N.
