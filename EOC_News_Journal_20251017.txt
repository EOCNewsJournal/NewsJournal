Under the scheme  the loan would only be repaid by Ukraine once Russia started paying reparations for its invasion.This follows indications that US President Donald Trump intends to taper off military support for Ukraine  with the burden falling on the EU to purchase the weapons that would be provided by the United States.It also follows an assessment by the UN  World Bank  Ukraine and the European Commission that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine now amounts to $524 billion.There are various estimates of the scale of frozen Russian assets  but they generally are thought to amount to up to €300 billionEU leaders are expected to discuss the proposal at a summit in Brussels next week.Belgium has long expressed reservations about the reparations loan plan as some €194 billion of the frozen Russian assets are held in the Belgian-based securities and deposits company Euroclear.The Belgian government wants to ensure that any liabilities from the reparations loan - should Russia take legal action - be shared by member states.In the statement  the Russian embassy said any attempt to seize the assets would be ""legally null and void under international and contract law.""It added: ""We will act in accordance with the principle of reciprocity in international relations and respond in kind. The unfriendly actions will get a due response which is going to hurt. Russia possesses a wide range of countermeasures and capabilities to compensate for the resulting damages.""Read more: Trump and Putin to meet again after making progress in Ukraine talksThe statement  issued by Nikita Isakin  the embassy’s third secretary  said Russia would not pay any reparations  and that the move would ""only prolong [the] agony"" of the ""Kiev regime"".The statement concluded: ""Accordingly  it will be the EU which in the final analysis will bear the full responsibility – including criminal one – for the consequences of the possible confiscation of our assets and will have to foot the bill for all loans given to Kiev.""",negative,0.0,0.35,0.65,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['Russian embassy', 'frozen assets', 'EU', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Western economy"" risks', 'EU financial sector', 'international financial markets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU member states', 'reparations loan plan', 'World Bank', 'Western markets', 'financial assets', 'United States', 'Russian embassy', 'safe haven', 'single currency', 'capital flow', 'debt accumulation', 'unfair competition', 'various estimates', 'military support', 'European Commission', 'Belgian-based securities', 'deposits company', 'Belgian government', 'legal action', 'contract law', 'international relations', 'unfriendly actions', 'due response', 'wide range', 'resulting damages', 'Nikita Isakin', 'third secretary', 'final analysis', 'full responsibility', 'criminal one', 'possible confiscation', 'EU leaders', 'full-scale invasion', 'Kiev regime', 'Ukraine talks', 'Ireland', 'plans', 'tens', 'billions', 'statement', 'reputation', 'seizure', 'credibility', 'collapse', 'domination', 'sanctions', 'proposal', 'scheme', 'indications', 'burden', 'weapons', 'assessment', 'cost', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'reservations', 'Euroclear', 'liabilities', 'attempt', 'accordance', 'principle', 'reciprocity', 'kind', 'countermeasures', 'capabilities', 'Putin', 'progress', 'move', 'agony', 'consequences', 'loans']",2025-10-16,2025-10-17,rte.ie

Although Africa accounts for only a small share of global greenhouse gas emissions  it hosts significant mineral resources  making it a key region for shaping the future of energy sustainability.Through this partnership  Voltalia and IFC are joining forces to identify and develop Power-to-Mine (PtM) projects that aim to reduce mining companies’ reliance on carbon-intensive energy sources by integrating renewable energy solutions. The initiative will prioritize the short- to medium-term deployment of renewable power infrastructure in selected African countries.Voltalia will bring its comprehensive expertise across the entire project lifecycle  ensuring the delivery of reliable and high-performance energy systems.Together  the partners will deliver fully integrated  turnkey renewable energy solutions tailored to mining operations. These may include hybrid solar- wind systems  battery storage  corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs)  construction and maintenance services.Robert Klein  CEO of Voltalia  commented: “This collaboration with IFC reflects our shared ambition to accelerate the minerals sector’s transition to cleaner energy. By combining Voltalia’s technical expertise with IFC’s development-driven approach  we’re helping to build a more resilient and sustainable energy future for the mining sector.”Valerie Levkov  IFC Global Industry Director for Energy  Metals & Mining and Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory  said: “IFC’s partnership with Voltalia will bring renewable energy technologies to Africa’s important minerals sector  which contributes to jobs and economic development across the continent. Working with Voltalia  IFC will support tangible and long-term solutions that bring environmental and economic benefits.”Voltalia’s long-standing commitment to environmental improvement and local development is embedded in its strategy and operations  making this initiative a natural extension of its purpose-driven approach.This partnership also supports the mineral industry’s broader decarbonization goals and contributes to the objectives of Mission 300  an ambitious initiative led by the World Bank Group and African Development Bank to connect 300 million people in Africa to sustainable  affordable  and reliable electricity by 2030  and IFC’s support for distributed renewable energy solutions.Next on the agenda: Q3 Turnover 2025  on October 22nd 2025 (post-closing)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in renewable energies.

Frankfurt: Bitwise today announces the launch of the Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP (Ticker TIAB; ISIN DE000A4APRP0) on Euronext Paris. The product seeks to provide exchange-traded exposure to TIA  the native token of the Celestia blockchain pl…,Product aims to give exposure to Celestia native token  as well as staking returnsCelestia is a rapidly growing modular layer 1 blockchain with use cases in high-performance trading  real-world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins.Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP is the company’s sixth institutional-grade staking product  with rising investor assets showing active demand for staking products16 October 2025. Frankfurt: Bitwise today announces the launch of the Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP (Ticker TIAB; ISIN DE000A4APRP0) on Euronext Paris. The product seeks to provide exchange-traded exposure to TIA  the native token of the Celestia blockchain platform  replicating the Kaiko Bitwise Staked TIA Index. At the same time  the ETP aims to capture staking rewards without the need for investors to manage the technical aspects of the staking process  which enables token holders to earn rewards in return for validating transactions in proof-of-stake networks such as Celestia.Celestia aims to be the leader in modular blockchains  built for extreme speed and specialization. Its Layer 1 is designed to handle use cases that need high data throughput and low costs  such as high-performance trading  stablecoins  and real-world assets (RWAs). It also allows other blockchains  known as “rollups” or “Layer 2s ” to publish their data on Celestia. Over the past year  usage of Celestia’s “namespaces” — unique identifiers for posted data — has increased roughly fivefold. This growth reflects both the launch of new rollups and higher activity from existing ones.Bradley Duke  Head of Europe at Bitwise  said: “The Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP is an extremely relevant addition to our growing product suite of institutional-grade  crypto exchange-traded products. Celestia’s blockchain has rapidly become known for its modular approach  with a data availability layer that is separate from functions such as execution. This has enabled it to fully focus on data availability and rapidly attract new users. Some have compared Celestia to a cloud services infrastructure provider for the crypto space. We believe investors can now benefit from its potential upside opportunities through Bitwise’s expertise and the transparency of a regulated product structure..”TIAB is the sixth product Bitwise has launched as part of its European Total Return product suite  as the company actively expands access for investors to its suite of index-linked staking products. Underscoring the rising demand for staking products  the Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL; ISIN DE000A4A59D2) recently surpassed $100 million in invested assets  while the Bitwise Ethereum Staking ETP (ET32; ISIN DE000A3G90G9)  has crossed the $300 million threshold in invested funds.The Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP is fully backed by TIA tokens held in cold storage custody  and issued in Germany. It is designed to deliver efficient staking returns with a low total cost of ownership  with staking rewards accumulating daily  increasing the cryptocurrency entitlement per ETP unit. By referencing the Kaiko Bitwise Staked TIA Index  investors can track its performance  net of costs and fees  against the market standard. Investors can buy and sell Bitwise Celestia Staking ETPs like stocks or ETFs through a securities account  without the need for a new account or crypto wallet.“The most ambitious projects in crypto are choosing Celestia to go mainstream ” said Mustafa Al-Bassam  co-founder and CEO of Celestia Foundation. “We’re seeing a surge of projects across high-performance trading  real-world assets  and stablecoins building on Celestia. Our modular architecture is purpose-built for the extreme speed and specialization these applications demand  helping teams go to market faster and scale further than what other monolithic L1s are capable of today.”Staking is a way to generate additional returns for token holders  allowing them to help validate transactions on the network  contributing to its security and reliability. In return  they earn additional tokens. Unlike dividends  which come from company profits  staking rewards compensate holders for performing an active role in maintaining the blockchain. The Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP offers investors a streamlined way to gain exposure to staking rewards without the need to hold a wallet or managing the technical aspects of staking or token custody directly. Additional benefits include daily liquidity and security stemming from cold storage of the tokens by a professional institutional custodian.Key Product DetailsETP Name Bitwise Celestia Staking ETP Primary Ticker TIAB ISIN / WKN DE000A4APRP0 / A4APRP Index Benchmark Kaiko Bitwise Staked TIA Index Target NET Staking Reward* 7.54%* TER 0.85% p.a.* The Net Staking Reward represents the return that is aimed to be generated from staking the ETP’s assets in line with the benchmark  after deduction of the Staking Service Fee but before the annual management fee (TER 0.85% p.a.) is applied. The issuer retains 33% of the total staking rewards generated as a Staking Service Fee. This fee is used to cover the operational costs of maintaining the ETP’s staking infrastructure  including charges from staking service providers  and to support the ongoing management of the staking process. Rewards are credited to the ETP on a daily basis and reinvested automatically  which increases the cryptocurrency entitlement per ETP unit over time. The staking rate may vary depending on network conditions  reward levels  and overall market dynamics. Disclaimer: The stated staking reward is not a guarantee of future returns. Actual outcomes can differ due to factors such as protocol rules  validator participation  market volatility  network performance  usage  and validator transaction fees. Staking involves risks  including the potential loss of staked assets and accrued rewards in the event of slashing  penalties  smart contract vulnerabilities  protocol exploits  or other operational issues.

The Company unveiled the design of the pivotal Phase 2  its planned registration path for lasme-cel's initial indication  as well as the commercial opportunity. The event also included panel discussions with global hematology experts on the potential of lasme-cel to address the significant unmet need for heavily pretreated patients.“We are encouraged by the Phase 1 results of the BALLI-01 study in a population that had largely exhausted treatment options and faced a poor prognosis. The depth of response we observed  enabling a high percentage of patients in the study to proceed to transplant  with the potential for durable remission  is clinically meaningful. We are focused on rapidly advancing our pivotal Phase 2 program and bringing lasme1-cel to patients with this significant unmet need ” said Adrian Kilcoyne  MD  MPH  MBA  Chief Medical Officer of Cellectis.“Today  Cellectis’ has reached a tipping point as we move lasme-cel into a pivotal Phase 2 trial. The need in refractory or relapsed B-ALL  especially for adult patients for whom every day counts  is significant. Our strategy is to achieve minimal residual disease-negative (MRD-negative) complete remission to create a window for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and meaningfully improve overall survival. Cellectis is pioneering allogeneic CAR-T therapies that aim to be safer  faster  and more scalable and accessible therapy. Lasme-cel is designed to be off-the-shelf  ready when the patient is ready  so it may enable rapid disease control instead of waiting  potentially bringing more patients to the point where transplant becomes possible ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer of Cellectis. “That is why an allogeneic CD22 approach is not just another CD19 program  it is potential solution for a broader patient population facing r/r B-ALL.”BALLI-01 Phase 1 Study Evaluating lasme-celThe Phase 1 of BALLI-01 clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of lasme-cel in patients with r/r B-ALL.The BALLI-01 trial enrolled 40 patients aged 15–70 years expressing >70% CD22 on leukemic blasts. Subjects were heavily pretreated with a median of 4 prior lines of therapy: 80% of subjects had received prior blinatumomab  approximately half had received prior inotuzumab and prior CD19 autologous CAR-T therapy.Lasme-cel was given at escalating dose levels following lymphodepletion with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA). The addition of alemtuzumab was implemented to sustain host T-cell and Natural Killer (NK)-cell depletion and to support lasme-cel expansion and persistence.Phase 1 Safety Data:The Phase 1 safety data confirm that lasme-cel was generally well-tolerated  with expectations for CAR-T therapies  with manageable adverse events  including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were uncommon  with only 1 case reported at Dose Level 3 (DL3)Adverse event of special interest (AESI) of CRS occurred in 2.5% of patients and ICANS in 5% of patients8 lasme-cel related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reportedPhase 1 Activity DataIn the Phase 1 of BALLI-01 study  40 transplant ineligible 3L+ patients were dosed with lasme-cel: 18 patients were dosed with product manufactured by an external CDMO (Process 1  or P1) and 22 patients were dosed with Cellectis-manufactured product (Process 2  or P2). In this dataset  P2 was associated with higher response rate than P1:Complete Remission (CR) / Complete Remission with complete hematologic Recovery (CRi) rate: 18% for P1 vs 36% for P2.At Dose Level 3 P2 (DL3)  the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)  12 patients were dosed (n=12):The CR/CRi rate was 42%  with 80% of these responders achieving MRD-negative statusFor the subset of 9 patients who met the criteria of the pivotal Phase 2 population (Process 2  DL3  age ≤ 50):The CR/CRi rate was 56% with 80% of responders MRD-negativeThe ORR was 100% with MRD-negative in 78%In patients treated with P2  13 patients had relapsed after prior CD22 targeted therapy (Inotuzumab). Of these 13 patients  4 (31%) achieved CR/CRi with MRD-negative status and all 4 achieved hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the overall P2 cohort  the ORR was 69% with MRD-negativity in 83% of responders.At the RP2D (DL3) subset  7 of these 12 patients had prior inotuzumab exposure with 43% achieving MRD-negative CR/CRi  and all of these achieved HSCT.In the P2 cohort  11 of 22 patients received 3 prior targeted therapies-CD19 CAR-T  blinatumumab and inotuzumab. Among these heavily pretreated patients  36% achieved CR/CRi with MRD-negative status.The survival curve for this study suggests a clear benefit: patients who proceeded to HSCT after lasme-cel therapy showed a trend to longer overall survival than those who did not undergo transplant.The Phase 1 data showed that lasme-cel maintained its efficacy regardless of the number or type of previous treatments  including CAR-T (60% of subjects)  transplant (50% of patients)  and blinatumomab (80% of subjects).Taken together  these findings position lasme-cel as a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with r/r B-ALL.Following successful End-of-Phase 1 meetings with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  Cellectis provided a registration path for lasme-cel as a bridge to transplant in r/r ALL. The first patient in pivotal Phase 2 is expected to be enrolled in Q4 2025. Cellectis anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2028.B-ALL PanelCellectis’ R&D Day also included a panel discussion on the potential of lasme-cel to address the significant unmet need for r/r B-ALL patients. Panelists included:Pr. Nitin Jain  Professor of Medicine Department of Leukemia at MD Anderson Cancer CenterPr. Nicolas Boissel  Head of the Adolescents and Young Adults Unit of the Hematology Department of Hôpital Saint-Louis AP-HPDr. Aravind Ramakrishnan  Leading Oncologist and Program medical Director for the Sarah Cannon Transplant & Cellular Therapy ProgramCommercial Opportunity for Lasme-celAs part of the R&D Day presentation  the Company discussed the potential commercial opportunity for lasme-cel in r/r B-ALL.If approved for commercialization  Cellectis estimates that lasme-cel has the potential to reach up to approximately 1 900 addressable 3L+ B-ALL patients annually in 2035 across the U.S.  EU4 (Germany  France  Spain  Italy) and UK. Of the projected incident 1L treated B-ALL population of approximately 9 200 patients  about 45% are expected to progress to 2L (mostly adolescents and adults given better outcomes for children) and two-thirds of patients treated in the 2L setting are expected to go on to require further therapeutic intervention. Finally  approximately 70% of patients treated in the 3L setting are considered for clinical allogeneic CAR-T eligibility based on patient fitness and comorbidities.Lasme-cel is positioned to potentially capture a majority of such addressable market given that it provides an alternative target to CD19  one-time dosing  off-the-shelf availability and deep  MRD-responses in the 3L+ setting. Interviewed physician key opinion leaders indicated an expectation to use lasme-cel in a majority of 3L+ patients if available  and oncology analogs suggest an illustrative lasme-cel preference share of about 65% among eligible patients.Finally  lasme-cel has high pricing potential across the U.S.  EU4 and UK. For the EU4 and UK  Cellectis triangulated an illustrative lasme-cel 2025 anchor price of approximately $365 000 from the averaged CAR-T price range  with a projected list price in 2035 assumed to remain constant with 2025. For the U.S.  Cellectis triangulated an illustrative lasme-cel 2025 anchor price of approximately $515 000 from the averaged CAR-T price range  with a projected 2035 list price  assumed to grow at a ~5% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) based on the 2021-2025 price growth.2With the above assumptions  lasme-cel could achieve up to approximately $700 million in potential peak gross sales across the U.S.  EU4 and UK in 2035  corresponding to an estimation of about 1 100 patients treated annually. Furthermore  gross peak sales could increase to up to approximately $1.3 billion with potential label expansion to second line and first line MRD+ consolidation. These estimates highlight that lasme-cel has the potential to drive meaningful growth of the CAR-T market in B-ALL  leading to a robust peak sales potential with highly attractive margins stemming from the allogeneic approach.NatHaLi-01 study evaluating eti-cel (UCART20x22)Cellectis unveiled preliminary data on eti-cel  its allogeneic CAR-T product candidate for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphora (r/r NHL). These preliminary results demonstrate an encouraging overall response rate (ORR) of 86% and a complete response (CR) rate of 57% at the current dose level (n=7)  with 4 out of 7 patients achieving a complete response.The preliminary high rate of complete responses underscores the potential of this innovative approach to transform outcomes for r/r NHL patients. Further updates on the program are expected at the end of the year 2025.Strategic Partnership with AstraZenecaIn its presentation during the R&D Day  AstraZeneca highlighted the significance of its strategic investment and research collaboration with Cellectis to accelerate its cell therapy and genomic medicine ambitions.

It has since left the exchange.The “fundamentals” for an initial public offering (IPO) in Ireland “remain solid”  and many companies are “well positioned” to float in the future despite a drought in stock market listings  according to a new report from EY.The Irish market has not seen a company go public since 2021.The average daily value of trading in Irish equities on the Irish market has slid from €254 million to €179 million since 2023 as CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Kappa – now Smurfit Westrock – dropped their Irish quotations and moved their main listings to New York.Global IPO activity rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2025  according to the latest EY global trends report on the sector.While there were no IPOs in Ireland over the period  the report said recent policy developments here signal “a growing recognition of the need to strengthen the domestic capital markets ecosystem”.“The fundamentals remain solid  and we expect mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity to pick up as global conditions continue to stabilise ” said EY Ireland corporate finance partner Fergal McAleavey.“With strengths in fintech  medtech and AI  there are many Irish companies positioned well to participate in future IPO waves.”Euronext Dublin and other parties from the capital markets ecosystem have been lobbying successive governments in recent years for help to reboot the domestic equities market  where the number of listed companies has slumped by 60 per cent over the past two decades.Of the remaining 25 listed companies  Dalata Hotel Group is set to be taken over next month by a Scandinavian consortium  while Malin Corporation and Donegal Investment Group are essentially in wind-down.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe announced in his budget speech last week that stamp duty on share trading in public companies worth up to €1 billion would be scrapped.[ Paschal Donohoe to cut funds tax and scrap stock trading duty on firms worth up to €1bnOpens in new window ]“The measure aims to improve competitiveness and reduce barriers to investment in smaller listed companies ” said the EY report.However  a rate of 1 per cent will continue for larger companies  including nine companies currently worth more €1 billion on the Iseq All-Share index. Some of the larger names are viewed by industry observers to be the most inclined make the move to Wall Street.Europe has recorded 72 IPOs so far this year  raising $9.3 billion (€8 billion)  which represents a 36 per cent decline in proceeds year-on-year. However  the third quarter saw a six-fold increase in proceeds compared to the second.Property  hospitality and construction led the way in terms of deal count across European IPOs  while technology continued to dominate in terms of capital raised.A total of 370 IPOs raised $48.2 billion globally  marking a significant rebound in investor confidence with major indices across Europe  the US and Asia reaching strong highs after months of pressure from tariffs  interest rate uncertainty and debt concerns.India’s IPO pipeline is now the most active globally  with 254 listings in the first nine months of 2025  the highest of any market  with October alone expected to deliver over $5 billion in listings  including Tata Capital and LG Electronics India.,neutral,0.12,0.85,0.04,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.02,True,English,"['Irish companies', 'stock market', 'EY report', 'EY Ireland corporate finance partner', 'latest EY global trends report', 'domestic capital markets ecosystem', 'Dutch-based Corre Energy', 'average daily value', 'M&A) activity', 'past two decades', 'Dalata Hotel Group', 'Finance Paschal Donohoe', 'Iseq All-Share index', 'Global IPO activity', 'initial public offering', 'recent policy developments', 'domestic equities market', 'remaining 25 listed companies', 'Donegal Investment Group', 'smaller listed companies', 'interest rate uncertainty', 'LG Electronics India', 'Irish Stock Market', '36 per cent decline', 'stock trading duty', 'first nine months', 'future IPO waves', 'many Irish companies', 'stock market listings', 'EY report', 'global conditions', 'many companies', 'Irish equities', 'public companies', 'nine companies', 'Irish market', '60 per cent', '1 per cent', 'new report', 'recent years', 'stamp duty', 'Tata Capital', 'last companies', 'Irish quotations', 'larger companies', 'IPO pipeline', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'New York', 'third quarter', 'growing recognition', 'Fergal McAleavey', 'Euronext Dublin', 'other parties', 'successive governments', 'next month', 'Scandinavian consortium', 'Malin Corporation', 'budget speech', 'share trading', 'funds tax', 'new window', 'larger names', 'industry observers', 'Wall Street', 'six-fold increase', 'deal count', 'significant rebound', 'investor confidence', 'major indices', 'strong highs', 'debt concerns', 'main listings', 'EY.', 'European IPOs', '254 listings', '72 IPOs', '370 IPOs', 'Irish-led', 'exchange', 'fundamentals', 'drought', 'company', 'CRH', 'sector', 'period', 'need', 'mergers', 'acquisitions', 'strengths', 'fintech', 'medtech', 'number', 'down', 'Minister', 'firms', 'measure', 'competitiveness', 'barriers', 'move', 'proceeds', 'Property', 'hospitality', 'construction', 'way', 'terms', 'technology', 'total', 'Asia', 'pressure', 'tariffs', 'October']",2025-10-16,2025-10-17,irishtimes.com

This solid quarterly performance demonstrates the momentum of our organic growth  observed across all our geographic areas. Europe shows growth of +6.1% at constant exchange rates  driven by strong growth in the companion animal segment (+9.2%). This is mainly explained by the performance of petfood in Türkiye  partly attributable to the acquisition of Mopsan  as well as the success of our specialty ranges for reproduction  osteoarthritis  and the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's syndrome)  introduced this year. Lastly  our vaccines and dermatology products also show solid growth this quarter. The farm animal segment declined by -5.0% this quarter  primarily due to production delays in France on our antibiotic ranges for cattle in France  a country that otherwise shows very strong growth in the companion animal segment. North America recorded exceptional growth of +48.5% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly explained by a stocking effect on our dental ranges; the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by a destocking  whereas the current quarter is benefiting from a significant restocking by one of our distributors. Excluding this effect  underlying growth remains well-oriented at approximately 9.5%  driven by the momentum of our dental products  our 'mobility' range  and our dermatology products for companion animals. This performance is also supported by the launch of a new product for muscle function and by our range for osteoarthritis in dogs  all reinforced by our dermatology products for companion animals. Latin America also closed the quarter with strong growth of +11.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  supported by both companion animals (+14.2%) and farm animals (+17.0%). The growth mainly comes from Mexico  followed by a solid performance from all other countries except for our aquaculture activities in Chile  due to continued competitive pressure on one of our antiparasiticide products. The IMEA zone (India  Middle East  and Africa) continues its sustained growth in the third quarter with +9.7% at constant exchange rates and scope  predominantly in the farm animal segment. This progress is driven by India  which shows an increase of +6.5%  mainly in our nutritional product ranges for cattle. The MEA region continues its remarkable growth (+65.0%)  supported by the launch of new products and the development of activities in North Africa. The East Asia zone shows growth of +6.2% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of 2024. This improvement is driven by Japan and more specifically by Sasaeah (+9.1%)  with a solid performance from other countries in the zone except for China (-2.6%)  due to its farm animal segment. Finally  the Pacific zone confirms its exit from a difficult phase with an 8.5% increase in revenue at constant exchange rates and scope. This rise is attributable to a very good performance in New Zealand (+16.1%)  followed by a return to growth in Australia (+3.9%) with the gradual normalization of weather conditions and inventory levels among distributors.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of SeptemberOur revenue at the end of September 2025 stands at €1 102.4 million compared to €1 042.1 million in 2024  an overall increase of +5.8%. Excluding currency effects  revenue shows significant growth of +9.2%. The integration of Sasaeah  a company acquired in Japan in April 2024  contributes +1.4 percentage points to growth. At constant exchange rates and scope  organic growth over nine months reached +7.8%  favorably impacted by an increase in both volumes (estimated at ~4 percentage points) and prices (estimated at ~3 percentage points). It should be noted that the acquisition of Mopsan contributes 0.5 growth points and has not been restated from the constant scope as it was deemed non-material.At the end of September  Europe recorded a solid revenue increase of +6.8% at constant exchange rates. This growth is supported by all our regions and particularly by the United Kingdom (+5.7%)  Switzerland (+11.2%)  and Italy (+13.9%)  thanks notably to our specialty  dermatology  petfood products and vaccines for companion animals and cattle. Concurrently  Central and Eastern Europe showed growth of +28.6%  boosted by the petfood segment following the acquisition of Mopsan.France  on the other hand  shows relatively stable sales (+1%) at the end of September  mainly due to a slight decrease in sales of petfood and anti-inflammatory products for cattle. North America shows sustained growth of +18.1% at constant exchange rates and scope. However  excluding the stocking effect  underlying growth at the end of September remains robust at ~+10%; it was driven by strong sales momentum for our specialty and dental products for companion animals. Latin America  driven by Mexico  Colombia  and Brazil  recorded strong growth of +9.1% at constant exchange rates and scope with companion animals (+12.5%) and farm animals segments (+10.0%). This performance was partially offset by a decline in our aquaculture activities in Chile (-10.0%)  mainly linked to the negative trend of one of our antiparasiticide products facing increased competition. IMEA also shows solid growth of +8.7% at constant exchange rates and scope. This progress is generated by good performance in all regions and particularly in India (+6.1%). East Asia experienced growth of +3.2% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by good momentum in all countries of this zone except for Vietnam  which  due to a swine fever epidemic  recorded a decrease in its activities of -15.4%. Finally  the decline in activity in the Pacific is gradually easing to -3.6% at the end of September at constant exchange rates and scope. This decrease is mainly attributable to the trend in Australia (-8.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  of which ~5% is explained by stocking effects) offset by sales growth in New Zealand (+11.2% at constant exchange rates and scope). As indicated above  we are seeing a return to growth in Australia in the third quarter  favored by improving market conditions and the normalization of inventory levels at our distributors.In terms of species  the companion animal business grew by +11.3% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by the strong momentum of our dental  dermatology  petfood  and specialty product ranges. The farm animal segment shows growth of +6.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly generated by the ruminant segment with our ranges of vaccines  nutritional products  and anti-inflammatory products for cattle.Outlook 2025Given the sales momentum observed in the third quarter  revenue growth at constant exchange rates and scope is now expected to be between 5.5% and 7.5% (against 4 to 6% before). The impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to represent an additional ~1 point of growth in 2025. The ratio of ""current operating income before depreciation of assets resulting from acquisitions"" to ""revenue"" is expected to consolidate around 16% at constant scope and exchange rates  despite the temporary impact of the longer-than-anticipated restart of a production unit following planned maintenance (which represents a loss of 0.5pt of profit). The impact of the Sasaeah acquisition is expected to be broadly neutral on the operating profit ratio in 2025. As for our cash position  it is expected to improve by ~€80 million in 2025 excluding any potential acquisitions.We anticipate a moderate impact from the possible increase in customs tariffs in the United States. Indeed  approximately two-thirds of our US revenue in 2025 and nearly 80% by the end of 2026 (due to ongoing industrial projects) are expected to be generated by our local production in the United States. Furthermore  purchases by our US subsidiary of components and raw materials from outside the United States represent approximately €8 million over a full year. Given this  the direct impact of the tariffs (i.e.  not taking into account any potential price increases that could offset all or part of these impacts)  as assessed to date  is around US$4 million on a full-year basis.Consolidated revenue by quarterConsolidated revenues (not audited)in €m 2025 2024 Actual exchange rate Constant exchange rate2 Constant exchange rate and scope1First quarter revenue 375 346 8.5 % 9.5 % 4.9 % Second quarter revenue 363 357 1.7 % 6.1 % 6.4 % Third quarter revenue 364 339 7.3 % 12.3 % 12.5 % Revenue at the end of September 1 102 1 042 5.8 % 9.2 % 7.8 %Cumulated consolidated revenue at the end of September by regionConsolidated revenues (not audited)in €m 2025 2024 Actual exchange rate Constant exchange rate2 Constant exchange rate and scope1Europe 445 420 6.1 % 6.8 % 6.8 % North America 153 134 14.7 % 18.1 % 18.1 % Latin America 166 166 (0.1)% 9.0 % 9.0 % Far East Asia 113 94 19.5 % 20.5 % 3.2 % Pacific 77 85 (9.5)% (3.6)% (3.6)% IMEA 148 143 3.4 % 8.7 % 8.7 % Revenue at the end of September 1 102 1 042 5.8 % 9.2 % 7.8 %Caring for animals togetherAt Virbac  we are constantly exploring new ways to prevent  diagnose and treat the majority of animal pathologies.
