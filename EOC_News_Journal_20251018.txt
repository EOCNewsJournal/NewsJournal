The Trump administration has pushed its G-7 counterparts  which include Italy  France  and Germany  to seize billions in frozen Russian assets  according to the Financial Times.So far  European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv  but some countries have been concerned about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues.""The European Council is committed to finding ways to help address Ukraine's pressing needs for 2026-2027  including for its military and defense efforts. It therefore calls on the commission to present as soon as possible concrete proposals involving the possible use of the cash balances associated with the immobilized Russian assets "" a draft document seen by CNBC stated.The document forms the basis for conversations among the 27 EU heads of state due to gather in Brussels Thursday.Belgium has been particularly tough on the subject  given that it hosts Euroclear – the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Instead  the federal government  its agencies and Crown corporations spend more than an estimated $100 million a year on advertising with U.S.-owned tech companies like Facebook  Instagram  Google  X  and YouTube.Support for this concept is approaching a national consensus  with strong support found coast to coast and across generations:Support is approaching nine in ten in Atlantic Canada (89%) and Alberta (88%)  with at least eight in supporting this policy in British Columbia (85%)  Ontario (82%)  Quebec (80%) and Saskatchewan and Manitoba (79%).Across the generations  Boomers (90%) exhibit the strongest support  followed by Gen X (80%)  Millennials (80%) and Gen Z (79%).Some provincial governments  like Ontario  have a “Buy Canadian” rule that says that at least 25% of government advertising must be with Canadian media. Reflecting on this  nine in ten (88%) Canadians support (51% strongly/37% somewhat) this rule  rising to 90% support in Ontario itself.Such strong support for a “Buy Canadian” mandate is being driven by geopolitical factors  most notably Canada’s dispute with the United States and President Donald Trump. Considering this  most (85%) Canadians agree (61% strongly/24% somewhat) that given the current tensions with the United States and the actions of the Trump administration  it is more important than ever for Canada to have a strong and independent news media that tells Canada’s story to Canadians. Once again  support is strong across the generations and regions of Canada  particularly among Boomers (93%) and in BC (90%)  Saskatchewan and Manitoba (90%) and Ontario (88%).Darrell Bricker  Global CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs  who conducted the study for The Toronto Star  said: “You don’t often see this level of consensus in Canadian public opinion. But when it comes to defending our sovereignty  Canadians want their government to back Canadian-owned media with its advertising dollars.”Jordan Bitove  Publisher of the Toronto Star and Owner of Torstar Corporation  said: “The federal government shouldn't be sending the majority of its advertising dollars to Silicon Valley. The new Buy Canadian policy is an opportunity for the federal government to listen to the public and work with Canadian-owned and operated media organizations to reach Canadians.”About the StudyThese are the findings of an Ipsos survey conducted on behalf of the Toronto Star from October 10th to 14th  2025. A total of n = 1002 Canadians aged 18+ participated in the survey which was fielded via the Ipsos I-Say panel. Quotas and weighting were used to ensure the sample's composition reflects that of the Canadian population according to census parameters. The survey has a credibility interval of +/- 3.8 percentage points  19 times out of 20  of what the results would have been had all Canadian adults 18+ been surveyed.For more information on this Factum  please contact:Darrell Bricker  PhDCEO  Ipsos Public AffairsDarrell.Bricker@ipsos.comMelanie KaralisDirector of Public Relations and Brand Engagement  Torstar Corporationmkaralis@torstar.ca548 588 1279About IpsosIpsos is the world’s third largest market research company  present in 90 markets and employing more than 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

The European...,Sanofi provides update on regulatory review in the EU for Rezurock to treat chronic graft-vs-host diseaseParis  October 17  2025. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a negative opinion on the marketing authorisation application for Rezurock (belumosudil) for the third-line treatment of adults and pediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Sanofi will seek a re-examination of the CHMP opinion.cGVHD is a life-threatening complication that devastates the lives of up to 50% of patients who undergo a stem cell transplant. cGVHD is considered one of the main causes of morbidity and late non-relapse mortality after stem cell transplant.“We are disappointed by the negative CHMP opinion for Rezurock in the EU and remain committed to serving the transplant patient community ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines at Sanofi. “Sanofi is confident in the body of clinical and real-world evidence that underscores Rezurock’s consistent efficacy and well-established safety profile for treating third-line chronic graft-versus-host disease. We will continue to work closely with the European Medicines Agency with the aim of bringing this treatment to patients in the EU who are waiting.”Rezurock is supported by safety and efficacy results from several clinical studies and real-world evidence. This includes the randomized  multicenter ROCKstar phase 2 study  that demonstrates consistent efficacy and tolerability for patients living with cGVHD after stem cell transplant as well as durable clinical responses over a period of three years.Rezurock is currently approved in 20 countries  including the US  UK and Canada for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with cGVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy and in China after failure of one prior line of systemic therapy.More than 17 000 patients living with cGVHD worldwide have been prescribed Rezurock since its first approval in the US in July 2021.About RezurockRezurock (belumosudil) is a first-in-class selective ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2) inhibitor (ROCK2i).Sanofi is committed to investigating the benefits of Rezurock in other age groups and indications  including through ongoing studies for pediatric patients with cGVHD from one year old who have been treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy and for patients with chronic lung allograft dysfunction.About chronic graft-versus-host diseaseGVHD is a complication that can occur following stem cell transplant (or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant) where the donor’s (graft) cells attack the host’s cells  leading to inflammation and fibrosis (scarring or thickening) that can damage multiple tissues and organs. Chronic GVHD devastates the lives of up to 50% of patients who undergo an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. GVHD is considered one of the main causes of morbidity and late non-relapse mortality after stem cell transplant. The consequences are far-reaching  both in terms of the burden it can place on the individual’s physical and emotional well-being  as well as the broader socio-economic impact.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Wayrilz (rilzabrutinib) as a new treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. A final decision is expected in the coming months.“The CHMP’s recommendation of Wayrilz for approval is a positive step forward for people in the EU living with ITP who continue to experience symptoms that impact their daily living despite treatment with certain other therapies ” said Brian Foard  Executive Vice President  Head of Specialty Care at Sanofi. “Through multi-immune modulation  Wayrilz shows promise in addressing the root cause of ITP – complex immune system dysregulation  reinforcing Sanofi’s commitment to finding novel ways to address unmet patient needs in rare and immunological diseases.”The positive CHMP opinion is based on the pivotal LUNA 3 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766)  presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024 and also published in Blood. Wayrilz met both the primary and secondary endpoints  making LUNA 3 the first phase 3 study to show a positive impact on sustained platelet counts  bleeding  and other ITP symptoms with an oral  reversible  Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.Wayrilz has already been approved in the US and the United Arab Emirates. In addition to the EU  Wayrilz is currently under regulatory review for ITP in China. It received fast track and orphan drug designations (ODD) in the US for ITP  with similar orphan designations in the EU and Japan. In other indications under investigation  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Wayrilz ODD for three additional rare diseases  including warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA)  IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)  and sickle cell disease (SCD). Wayrilz also received FDA fast track designation and EU orphan designation in IgG4-RD.About the LUNA 3 studyLUNA 3 (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766) was a randomized  multicenter  phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Wayrilz vs. placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients received either oral Wayrilz 400 mg twice a day or placebo through a 12- to 24-week double-blind treatment period  followed by a 28-week open-label treatment period  and then a four-week safety follow-up or long-term extension period. The adolescent part of the study is ongoing. The primary endpoint for the EU is the proportion of adult participants able to achieve platelet counts at or above 50 000/μL for at least eight out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week blinded treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. Secondary endpoints included time to platelet response (platelet count ≥50 x 109/L or between 30 x 109/L and <50 x 109/L and at least doubled from baseline in absence of rescue therapy)  number of weeks maintaining a specific platelet response (i.e.  doubled or within range)  rescue therapy use  physical fatigue score  and bleeding score as assessed by change from baseline in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Bleeding Scale (IBLS) assessment at Week 25.About WayrilzWayrilz (rilzabrutinib) is the first BTK inhibitor for ITP that helps address the root cause of disease through multi-immune modulation. This innovative therapy is approved in the US for adults with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. Additionally  Wayrilz is approved in the United Arab Emirates for adult patients with persistent or chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response or intolerance to a previous treatment. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in multiple immune-mediated disease processes and inflammatory pathways. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  Wayrilz can selectively inhibit the BTK target.Wayrilz is being studied across a variety of rare diseases  including wAIHA  IgG4-RD  and SCD. These additional indications are currently under investigation and have not been approved by regulatory authorities.About ITPITP is a disease of complex immune dysregulation that causes low platelet counts (<100 000/μL)  resulting in a variety of bleeding symptoms and thromboembolism risk. Beyond bruising and bleeding  which can include potentially life-threatening episodes like intracranial hemorrhage  people living with ITP may experience reduced quality of life  including physical fatigue and cognitive impairment.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Revenue growth of 2.7% on a like-for-like basis.Group EBITDA reported for the year ended June 2025 was up 1.7% or €10m at €621m  despite the (€53m) decrease in French grants and other funding  as well as industry-wide inflation continuing to be under-funded by governments.French tariffs experienced a +2 2% increase in French MSO activities from July 2024 from the CICE coefficient cancelation  however not applied in January and February hence with a €9m shortfall  and +0.5% indexation from March 2025. The 2024 prudential coefficient on French tariffed revenue has been withheld entirely by the government  unlike prior years (€15m last year).French grants curtailed including €21m lower French revenue guarantee  now discontinued  and €17m inflation grant received last year that has not been reconducted.Cost saving efforts  review of portfolio of facilities and productivity improvements were sustained to absorb reduced grant funding and higher inflation on operating costs than on revenue rates.Net loss (group share) of €54m stable compared to last year due to higher lease depreciation expense and increasing costs of debt offsetting the improvement in EBITDA.Debt leverage ratio at 4.7x and €367m of cash & equivalents as at June 30th 2025 (vs. respectively 4.9x and €359m as at June 30th 2024)Mission in Action: Ramsay Santé Expands Access  Elevates Care  and Strengthens TrustServing patients at scale – As a mission-driven company since 2022  Ramsay Santé continues to expand access to care and medical innovation across France  Sweden  Norway  Denmark  and Italy  reaching 13 million patients.Ramsay Santé operates where healthcare needs are greatest: in France  60% of our facilities are located in underserved areas  including a quarter of the total — in priority intervention zones  among the most fragile and under-resourced of the country.Outstanding results – Record Net Promoter Score in France (74%)  strong employee engagement across Europe (71%)  and a 6% reduction in GHG emissions (at constant perimeter)Innovating care delivery – Expansion of day hospitals in France  AI-assisted medical reporting in Sweden  and post-hospitalization remote monitoring in France.Excellence recognized – Quality certification scores 10 points above national average in France  reflecting superior medical outcomes and patient experience.Reputation on the rise – Group awareness reaches 74% in Norway  70% in Sweden  and 69% in France  strengthening trust and visibility across markets.Collaborative momentum – Cross-border initiatives between teams and medical communities accelerating innovation and reinforcing care quality.Mission-Led Strategy Delivers Tangible WinsIn October 2024  Capio was awarded the assignment to provide care at St. Göran's Hospital in Stockholm for at least 8 additional years from January 2026  for a contract value  calculated for (8+4) years  of c.€4.8bn (SEK 55bn) and better price conditions. Continued growth of outpatient activities with strong development of primary care in France  opening of 3 primary care centres in Norway  4 new mental health outpatient settings in France (8 as of today) with further 2 openings in July 2025  and 8 new imaging heavy equipment in France within the year With 900k registered users in Sweden  My Pages   the app developed by Capio subsidiary  is transforming the patient journey by combining digital services with the preventive health program Capio Lifestyle . On 17 February 2025  Ramsay Santé repriced its senior debt facilities at more favourable margins with a single maturity in 2031. This transaction provides to all stakeholders a long-term financing framework to support the implementation of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategic plan.French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2024 was initially announced at +0.3% for the private sector compared to +4.3% for the public hospital system. The ensuing unprecedented mobilisation of private sector to obtain a fair treatment concluded with a government commitment resulting in a +3.2% tariff indexation for the private sector (inclusive of the 0.3%) from 1st July 2024 including the financing of specific night and weekend shift measures. French MSO tariff indexation for the 12 months commencing 1st March 2025 was at +0.5%.France revenue has grown by 5.9% including the contribution of the 12 former Cosem primary care centres taken over in June 2024  the opening of 4 new mental health day facilities  and the installation of 8 new imaging equipment since June 2024. Organic growth was supported by a 2.2% increase in MSO stays admissions (excluding sessions)  higher tariffs  higher medical purchases rechargeable revenue and benefitted from one additional business day vs. last year. This is despite the prudential coefficient on calendar year 2024 DRG billings  withheld entirely by the government (vs €14.7m last year  impacting French growth by 0.4pt).Nordic countries revenue grew by +0.5% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue growth of +2.2% benefitting from €23m (or 1.5%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation  and dynamic revenue at St Göran.Group reported EBITDA increased by €10.4m or 1.7% to €621.4m with a margin of 11.9%. The result was achieved despite (i) the prudential coefficient withholding on French tariffs representing a €14.7m (restated from this impact  EBITDA would be up +4.1% vs. last year  with a 12.1% margin)  (ii) the French revenue guarantee income decreasing by €21.4m over the period  and (iii) the €16.8m French inflation grant received last year that has not been reconducted. The adverse trend on HR and procurement inflation was not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions. The growth in operating result resulted from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions which compensated those headwinds together with positive contribution from acquisitions and FX effect.Net cash flow from operating activities of €693.7m (+€106.9m vs. last year) primarily reflected the improvement of working capital being favourably impacted by higher amount of French State cash advances (extended due to the late publication of tariffs) still to be repaid as at 30 June compared to last year as well as (ii) increasing EBITDA. Reported net financial debt as of 30 June 2025 amounted to €3 647.5m  of which €1 675.4m on a restated basis (i.e. restated from the IFRS16 impact on operating or non-financial rents – please refer to glossary for further details). Restated net leverage amounts to 4.7x as of June 2025 vs. 4.9x as of June 2024.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:""At Ramsay Santé  our mission continues to guide us.

St Göran's Hospital is one of the seven acute care hospitals in the Stockholm Region  and the only one run by a private operator. The hospital is an important part of the overall emergency care in the region and its mission is to provide acute and planned somatic medical care in outpatient and inpatient settings to meet the healthcare needs of the residents. The decision means that Capio may continue to run the business during the next contract period. The agreement is valid from 4 January 2026 for at least eight years  with the right for Region Stockholm to extend the agreement for a maximum of four years. The contract is one of the largest in the region and the contract value  calculated over 12 years  amounts to EUR 4.8 billion (SEK 55 billion).French government supporting grants curtailed  with a decreased contribution: Ramsay Santé's MSO (medical  surgical and obstetrics) hospitals in France continued to operate under the French government's revenue guarantee  which supports the healthcare facilities by offsetting the negative effects on activity lagging since the Covid pandemic crisis. The guarantee has been extended one last time for the calendar year up to 31 December 2024 and amounts to 50% of the amount of the revenue guarantee notified for 2023 (indexed with 2024 tariffs) plus 50% of the invoicing for activity carried out for 2024. In comparison  the same mechanism in place in the prior calendar year provided for a 70% guarantee rate.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group as “Other operating income” decreased from €41m for the year ending 30 June 2024 to €20m for the year ending 30 June 2025. The reduction stems from the change in guaranteed coverage  a further recovery in activity levels at the minority of Ramsay Santé French facilities still below pre-Covid levels benefitting from the scheme  and the discontinuation of the scheme which ended 31 December 2024.Ramsay Santé has successfully refinanced and then repriced its Senior Debt Facility : On 13 August 2024  Ramsay Santé finalized an Amend & Extend agreement for the refinancing of its €1 650m Senior Facilities  including €100m RCF and €100m Capex lines  proactively extending its upcoming 2026-2027 debt maturities to 2029-2031. The Amend & Extend was supported by existing lenders as well as a large number of new investors  allowing Ramsay Santé to fully extend its Term Loan B facility (TLB) whilst optimizing pricing during syndication. Ramsay Santé is fully engaged in the combination of economic  human et environmental interests to create the conditions for a sustainable growth. Therefore  the ESG scheme of existing Term Loan B facility has been reconducted and updated in a specific framework document  which enables a possible adjustment on margin (upwards or downwards) based on the evaluation of specific KPIs related to patient satisfaction  medical care for underserved population & preventive healthcare  employees’ satisfaction & prevention of psychological risks  as well as reduction of CO2 emissions (scope 1&2). Such refinancing enables Ramsay Santé to provide its stakeholders a long-term financing framework and further supports the implementation of its key initiatives as part of its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy. On 17 February 2025  Ramsay Santé successfully repriced its senior debt €1 025m TLB4 and extended for 2 years the maturity of its €425m TLB3  both merged into a new single Term Loan B5 of €1 450m maturing August 2031. Through this transaction  Ramsay Santé optimizes its cost of debt and further extends its debt maturities.Scope of consolidation : During the year  the Group sold a small health transport subsidiary  acquired a small primary care unit in Sweden and increased its stake to 81% in Qurant  a Swedish digital-enabled occupational health and prevention company  now consolidated.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and revenueRamsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €5 242m for the year ended 30 June 2025  up 4.7% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the year ended 30 June 2025 was up with a 2.7% organic growth.France revenue has grown by 5.9% including the contribution of the 12 Cosem primary care centres taken over by Ramsay Santé in June 2024  the opening of 4 mental health day facilities  and the installation of 8 new imaging equipment since July 2024. The organic growth was supported by (i) an increase in volumes supported by 1 additional business day compared to last year (ii) higher revenues from rechargeable medical purchases (iii) price increase from the cancellation of the CICE coefficient from 1st July 2024 (benefit from the full impact of tax credit for competitiveness and employment) adding the equivalent of a +2.2% tariff increase to the initial +0.3% MSO tariff increase from March 2024  (iv) +0.5% MSO tariff increase from March 2025 and (v) despite the prudential coefficient on 2024 DRG billings being withheld entirely  representing a €14.7m decrease versus last year impacting French growth by 0.4pt.France total admissions in our hospitals rose vs. prior corresponding period extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care: +2.2% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics) patient stays admissions driven by ambulatory care and +5.3% in mental health. Our French facilities managed approximately 718 000 emergency presentations this year confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions. Chemotherapy sessions increased by +2.0%  and dialysis sessions remained stable vs. last year.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +2.2% benefitting from €23.3m (or 1.4%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation (appreciation of SEK vs EUR versus the prior year period). Organic revenue growth in the Nordics for the full year ending June 2025 was +0.5% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate. Solid organic growth in Sweden fuelled by growing activity in St Göran notably driven by the ramp-up of its new maternity  and sustained demand in our Swedish elderly care clinics  offset by lower day patient volumes in the Eye specialty units in Norway and lower public and PHI volumes in Denmark. Primary care activity in Sweden was solid with a long-term increasing trend of listed patients  some price increases as well as improvements from digital tools and processes  all compensating the loss of some primary care contracts.EBITDAThe Group's EBITDA has increased +1.7% vs last year at €621.4m for the year ending 30 June 2025. It includes a €19.9m (last year €41.3m) income of French government's revenue guarantee  described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above. The reduced contribution from this mechanism was also added to a €14.7m price decrease vs last year though the government withholding the prudential coefficient on tariffed revenue. Funding otherwise received through French tariff increases and various public payors in the Nordics only partially covered inflation from medical staff salary and wages as well as overall procurement and outsourced services price increases. EBITDA and margins therefore continue to be constrained despite productivity efforts on incremental activity. Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to current inflation environment and resources allocation are revisited consequently.Operating profit and non-current itemsUnderlying current operating profit amounted to €187.4m for the year ending June 2025  up €3.2m on last year. Higher lease assets depreciation expense came from the effect of rent indexation and the contribution of FY24 acquisitions (e.g. Cosem).Other non-current income and expenses represent a net expense of €14.2m for full year ending June 2025  including facilities restructuring costs and fees for €5.5m  transaction and integration costs for €3.7m  as well as impairment and write-off costs for €5.4m. The previous year corresponding period shows a €23.6m expense mainly made of a €18.5m impairment charge of various French facilities’ assets.Financial result and net result after taxThe cost of net financial debt amounted to €194.4m for the full year ending June 2025  increasing €20.3m compared to €174.1m in the previous year. The higher expense was driven by higher interest costs from the increase in the senior debt margin post-refinancing  higher fixed hedge rates and the immediate €9.2m unamortised borrowing costs write-off as the consequence of the two senior debt refinancing transactions.Other financial income and expenses amount to €12.2m over the year ending 30 June 2025 vs. €27.3m last year  this variation being mainly explained by non-cash mark to market movements on an interest rate swap hedging arrangement recorded as an expense for €7.2m this year compared with an €21.0m expense last year (these impacts being non-recurring going forward as this swap arrangement matured in October 2024).The Group’s share of net loss for the year ended 30 June 2025 amounted to €54.1m  in line with the net loss of €53.9m last year.Restated aggregates:Reported EBITDA of €621.4m (+€10.4m vs. last year) in accordance with IFRS standards excludes contracted operating or non-financial lease expenses for €273.5m (vs. €258.9m last year) which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt. Increase of these operating lease expenses vs. prior year primarily came from the effect of price indexation and the contribution of FY24 acquisitions (e.g. COSEM).

Total cash outflow in investing activities was reduced by €42.1m versus last year thanks to tighter capex selection  additional proceeds from the sale of non-strategic non-hospital properties and reduced acquisition of shares in subsidiaries.The financing cash outflow is notably impacted the repayment of short term and amortising debt by €100m overall  new borrowings costs following the refinancing and repricing for €14m  and increased rent payments by €21m.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €366.5m as at 30 June 2025 increasing slightly by €7.5m€ compared to last year.Reported IFRS net debt on 30 June 2025 was €3 647.5m compared with €3 610.9m on 30 June 2024.

Yesterday I met with my source who deals with the “resistance” wing within New Democracy (ND). It’s the same source who told me a few days ago — and I passed it on to you — that “whoever goes to Karamanlis’ office (in Rafina) hears him say ‘let anyone come  as long as the brat goes’ ” referring to Mitsotakis. The new thing my source told me yesterday was a variation on that theme — this time coming from Samaras. “Pollsters tell me I’ll get 7%-9%  but I say over 10%. I don’t care what I get in the elections  as long as Mitsotakis falls.” I find him very optimistic  but never mind — optimism is a source of life and everyone’s right. Still  to have as a life goal to go down in history as the man who toppled two ND governments — those of father and son Mitsotakis — while having himself been prime minister of the same party  says something… You might say  well  Karamanlis came out the other day saying that “the institutions are in danger ” when back when the country was collapsing and slipping in and out of the euro under SYRIZA  he was bragging that “he had a friend” in Tsipras  appointed Mimi as Minister of Justice  and spent his days and nights with Prokopis. Anyway  of all of them  I now prefer Karahalios.The Mediterranean ConferenceA remark by K.M. that many didn’t “catch” during his speech yesterday concerned Greece’s intention to invite all coastal states of the region to a forum “where we can jointly discuss all that concerns us.”In reality  Mitsotakis is reviving an old idea by former European Council President Charles Michel for a Mediterranean Conference involving all relevant parties — obviously including Turkey. Back then  Turkey objected to Cyprus’ participation  just as it would today regarding Israel. But since this could be “coming soon ” let’s keep it in mind.Triole-powerOutside the plenary hall  on the sidelines of the political leaders’ debate on foreign affairs  Androulakis  Zoe (Kωνσταντοπούλου)  and Charitsis had a long chat. According to one of my sources  the trio is preparing a joint initiative. The driving force  I’m told  is the leader of Plefsi Eleftherias (Course of Freedom)  followed by Nikos and Charitsis. The source claims the initiative will concern OPEKEPE (the agricultural payments agency)  though an even more dynamic move relating to the field of Justice isn’t ruled out. Could we see such a political trio?The Monastery of SinaiAnother piece of news concerns the arrangement between Greece and Egypt regarding the Monastery of Sinai and the safeguarding of its Christian Orthodox character. Now that the issue isn’t in the spotlight  the Foreign Ministry can make progress with the Egyptians  and it seems there’s movement toward a bilateral agreement. However  it also requires approval from the Sinai brotherhood. That’s why on Sunday  Minister Gerapetritis will be in Jerusalem  where the ordination of the new abbot of the Monastery  Symeon  will take place. He will also meet Patriarch Theophilos of Jerusalem  who has played a somewhat peculiar role  to put it politely. All church actors must be on board.Promotion and ReorganizationYesterday  in a brief announcement  Panagiotis Lembesis was appointed Deputy Secretary of ND’s Political Committee. It’s not that ND lacked another deputy under Skrekas — they already have two. In reality  the former ONNED vice-president was promoted  which makes him ineligible to run for head of the party’s Prefectural Committee in the Northern Sector. There had been an internal contest developing with another party member  Pantelis Stergiannis. A replacement is being sought  and I hear one possible candidate is “Mitsotakis loyalist” Giannis Maniatis  General Director of Asset Management and Maintenance at ADMIE.The Labor Bill and the FarceThe opposition denounced Kerameos’ labor bill as a “monstrosity ” a “nightmare ” claiming it legalized a “labor Middle Ages” with the 13-hour workday  etc. And in the end  what happened? In the roll-call vote completed yesterday morning  47 of the bill’s articles — practically half — were approved by more than 180 MPs (three-fifths of parliament). SYRIZA  which had fought the bill fiercely  walked out during the vote — obviously to avoid voting for several articles they actually agreed with.Possible Price Reductions in More ProductsThe initiative to reduce prices on consumer goods seems likely to continue — expanding both the number of product codes and the range of goods  possibly before Christmas. The recent action by 10 major retail chains stemmed from meetings between the Development Minister and supermarket representatives  discreet pressure on the food industry  and on multinationals — though the latter avoided meeting with the minister. Talks lasted 50 days. Last Monday  the list of 2 180 product codes was submitted to the ministry  and DIMEA immediately began inspections at supermarkets to record prices before and after the announcement  to produce the “labels.” Now  retailers  70 suppliers  the industry  and the ministry are measuring consumer response. If the reductions are well received  a new  larger  and broader list of discounted products will be created.Economic Diplomacy – Made in the USAYesterday’s (our time zone) schedule was packed for Kyriakos Pierrakakis in Washington. On the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings  the Greek Finance Minister met with Jeanne Shaheen  ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He also met his Turkish counterpart Mehmet Şimşek  emphasizing the positive bilateral agenda centered on the economy. With Saudi Finance Minister Faisal F. Alibrahim  Pierrakakis discussed investments and cooperation in energy  trade  tourism  infrastructure  and the digital economy. Let’s not forget Greece and Saudi Arabia are strategic partners  with a shared horizon in the ambitious IMEC corridor project linking India to Europe — a plan that will elevate both countries’ geoeconomic standing.High-Level ContactsAt the IMF headquarters  Kyriakos Pierrakakis met with Alfred Kammer  successor to Paul Thomsen at the Fund’s European Department — this time not to discuss austerity and memoranda  but reforms  investments  and Greece’s role as a model of stability for Europe. The round of meetings concluded late Thursday night (Greek time) with the dinner hosted by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva for the EU finance ministers  where Pierrakakis was one of only four expected to speak. I also hear that today he will have several high-level meetings with senior officials of the U.S. government’s economic team.The Euronext CEO Meets with the UnionsTurning to market news  let’s start with Euronext  which — though it still has exactly one month until its offer expires on November 17 (with a right to extend by two weeks) — is becoming active. Euronext CEO Stéphane Boujnah is currently in Athens  meeting with Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) shareholders. Today  Friday  he is scheduled to meet with the employee unions. It’s worth noting that Boujnah previously served at the French Ministry of Finance during Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s tenure  giving him political experience that will likely prove useful in today’s discussions. On Monday  his agenda includes a press conference on the public offer  Euronext’s intentions  and the new era of stock exchanges  followed by more meetings in the coming days.SNAPPI’s Interesting ExperimentYesterday  SNAPPI — Piraeus Bank’s digital bank — announced a new partnership with Public stores. Just a few days earlier  it had announced a similar partnership with AB Vassilopoulos  and it’s clear that more such collaborations will follow in the coming weeks. Public and AB Vassilopoulos  like most large retailers  already have long-standing partnerships with Piraeus Bank. This makes SNAPPI a very interesting experiment for the Greek market. Will it end up “cannibalizing” the same customer base that Piraeus Bank already serves  or will it succeed in attracting millennials who have no relationship with the bank? It will obviously aim to offer differentiated products — but is that enough? And if it is  will it still be enough one or two years from now? Do millennials represent a large enough customer base to make the venture financially viable? And how will SNAPPI compete against Revolut and other digital banks?The Tsoukaridis Nephew and the Adam Pack DealAs previously reported  the well-known company Adam Pack remains in Greek hands after being acquired by S.O. HOLDING — an SPV whose main shareholders also own CREATIVE PACK BLUEBOX  another firm active in paper packaging. In recent years  CREATIVE PACK BLUEBOX has emerged as a rising player in the sector  following its 2024 acquisition of KYTION from the PYRAMIS Group. It operates two production facilities — one in Agios Stefanos  Attica  and one in Kilkis — while Adam Pack runs its plant in Lavrio. A key role in closing the deal was played by George Oratis  co-founder of the company  group administrative director  and nephew of Yiannis Tsoukaridis of Paperpack  which was sold two years ago to a Chinese fund. Following the acquisition  reports say a significant investment plan will be launched to boost production capacity  reduce costs  and enter new markets. For 2025  CREATIVE PACK BLUEBOX expects revenue exceeding €13.5 million and EBITDA above €2 million  while Adam Pack is projecting revenue of around €16 million and EBITDA close to €1.5 million.A Weekend Spent Trying to UnderstandThe imposition of new port charges by Beijing on ships with U.S. links has sparked intense activity in the international shipping sector  with Greek companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges at the forefront.At the Capital Link Forum in New York  representatives of Greek-owned companies voiced their concerns.Loukas Barmparis  president of Safe Bulkers  said his company spent the weekend trying to decode the new requirements: “There were many terms that no one knows how they will be interpreted ” he noted  adding that the new rules will likely cause a global redistribution of vessels. Ioannis Zafirakis  CFO of Diana Shipping  exclaimed while trying to make sense of the Beijing text: “What do you even do with the parentheses in that document? It’s madness ” drawing laughter from the audience. Despite initial confusion  Diana Shipping will not be significantly affected  as its shareholders and board are less than 25% controlled by U.S. interests  while many of its ships were built in China. Stamatis Tsantanis  chairman and CEO of Seanergy Maritime Holdings and United Maritime  described the situation as “nightmarish.”Who Bought and Who Sold ShipsPerformance Shipping Inc.  owned by Aliki Paliou  led Greek secondhand market activity this week  acquiring two bulk carriers after intense competition. Also active was Harry Vafias  who  through his private  unlisted company Brave Maritime  acquired three bulk carriers. Incidentally  Vafias remains the top Greek shipowner in the sale-and-purchase market. British Bulkers Inc.  owned by George Agathocleous  added the Ultramax Imabari Queen to its fleet. On the selling side  Samos Steamship  owned by the Inglis family  sold the sister Aframax tankers Nafsika and Lorax (built in 2022)  while Minerva Marine  owned by Andreas Martinos Jr.  completed the sale of its older Aframax Minerva Lisa.Billions in Pressure on European ShippingBeyond the thorny issue of the International Maritime Organization’s new framework for the full decarbonization of global shipping  Europe’s maritime industry is entering a very difficult phase.At the recent “Walking into a New Era” conference  the rapidly rising costs were laid bare. The EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) and the FuelEU Maritime regulation represent regional EU responses to a global problem. The irony is that shipping accounts for just 2.5% of global emissions — and only 7.5% of that 2.5% occurs in European waters. According to European Commission data  European shipping companies will pay €2.5 billion in 2024  €5.7 billion in 2025  and €8.2 billion in 2026. These costs will ultimately be passed on to passengers and consumers  pushing inflation higher in Europe. Shipowners are calling for ETS and FuelEU revenues to be reinvested in the maritime sector — to support the green transition and prevent a loss of competitiveness.IMF Talks on Debt and the Risk of a Major CrisisThe charts  analyses  and forecasts circulating inside IMF meetings are chilling. Global debt has reached $338 trillion  rising by $14 trillion in just the second quarter of 2025. Analysts categorize global debt into three alarming trends: Household debt has hit $60 trillion  after a sharp rise since 2020.Corporate debt continues to grow steadily  now reaching $100 trillion.Governments owe $90 trillion  particularly after the pandemic  while banks and financial institutions collectively owe $88 trillion  marked by dangerously high leverage. Emerging economies have hit a record $109 trillion  equal to 242% of their GDP — meaning that countries with weak currencies and limited access to cheap financing are carrying a disproportionate burden. Data shows that the global debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen by one percentage point to 324% — but that’s due to nominal growth and inflation  not real improvement. The absolute increase of $14 trillion in a single quarter proves that global borrowing is accelerating. It’s not the first time global debt has exceeded 300% of global GDP — but history teaches that each time it happens  a major financial crisis follows.V. Nikolaidis Buys Jamie Oliver’s Former SchoolYesterday at noon  it was announced that the City & Guilds London Institute  Britain’s top vocational education organization  has been acquired by PeopleCert  Greece’s first “unicorn.” With this acquisition  Byron Nikolaidis’s company triples its revenue while also gaining ownership of the historic Giltspur House in London and a specialized training center in Cumbria  where professionals in nuclear energy and critical infrastructure are certified. A telling anecdote: a few years ago  the late Queen’s butler personally called the organization’s president  Dame Ann Limb  to ensure the continuation of the “C&G Butlers Qualification.” Queen Elizabeth trusted City & Guilds to guarantee that her butlers were properly trained — a testament to the quality of C&G certifications. Among its famous alumni are former England manager Gareth Southgate  celebrity chef Jamie Oliver  fashion designer Karen Millen  and many others. The acquisition — financed by a €150 million loan from Eurobank and PeopleCert’s own funds — adds €185 million in annual revenue to the group  bringing total turnover to €350 million. A Greek company acquiring one of Britain’s most historic institutions  at a time when skills — not degrees — have become the new currency of the labor market.Athens Stock Exchange: The instinct of self-preservation kicked inAnother —fourth consecutive— declining session with high trading activity of €321 million and many block trades worth €32.5 million. The General Index reacted only when —shortly after one in the afternoon— it lost the psychological threshold of 2 000 points  the level it had conquered since August 4. The General Index slipped to 1 995.41 points (-2.46%) and  with the help of Coca-Cola  OTE  PPC  and Cenergy  rose to 2 013.76 points (-1.57%). The Athens Stock Exchange is a market that today is worth €137 billion  and the largest portion of transactions (60%) is carried out by foreign investors who hold —mainly— bank shares  which have returned almost 90% since the beginning of the year. Naturally  when sentiment deteriorates  bank shares fall victim to their own success  as these are the ones fund managers first liquidate to secure their profits. Eurobank (-3.63% at €3.50)  National Bank (-2.64% at €13.30)  Alpha (-2.08% at €3.486)  Piraeus (-1.24% at €7.14)  and Bank of Cyprus (-2.74% at €7.80) were falling with high trading volumes. OPAP (€18.60  -0.3%) showed signs of a rebound  as at the start of the session it had been losing as much as -4.95%.Drone Training Seminars in GreeceResilience Tech  a Greek company providing advanced defense technology solutions through international partnerships  is launching a new Tactical FPV Training Center offering applied drone tactics and techniques. The Tactical FPV program  with 75 teaching hours  is more than a training course — it reflects a deep economic transformation. The experience from Ukraine  where drones costing only a few hundred euros destroy tanks worth millions  has reshaped strategic and economic thinking. Resilience Tech’s seminars provide drone operator certification  opening opportunities in fields such as agriculture  filmmaking  civil protection  and infrastructure security. This dual-use model (civil and defense) creates a resilient business framework even in peacetime. The program targets technicians  operators  security professionals  civil protection staff  and organizations seeking practical field-ready operational skills. Participants learn assembly  troubleshooting  flight control setup  software management  stealth tactics  and even electronic warfare countermeasures and anti-drone strategies.Even Germany Succumbs to the Sirens of DebtSince 2020  Germany’s public debt has soared by around 60% — the same pace as Italy’s.Italy began from debt levels above 100% of GDP  while Germany started near 60%. Germany’s first major debt surge came between 2000–2005  due to reunification and Schröder’s reforms. Then came the 2008–2012 financial crisis  with bank bailouts  and afterward the 2020–2024 pandemic and energy crisis. Of course  Germany financed its debt at negative interest rates  thanks to market confidence  while Italy and Greece paid high spreads. But now  Greece pays less than France  and the European Central Bank is reportedly concerned about Germany’s debt sustainability — which by 2030 could reach 100% of GDP.All the Money Is on AIInvestors are obsessed with Artificial Intelligence. Traditional industries no longer spark excitement — any investment containing the word “AI” triggers a frenzy. By October 2025  global venture capital investments have reached $367 billion  with $192.7 billion of that going to AI startups. All indications suggest that 2025 will be the first year when over 50% of total VC investments flow into artificial intelligence. Out of the $367 billion total  about $250 billion is being funneled into the U.S. economy  cementing AI’s status as the planet’s top investment focus. Meanwhile  other sectors — fintech  mobility tech  and even crypto — remain flat or are declining.AI Now Analyzes Central Bankers’ SpeechesAnd since we’re on the topic of AI: central bankers use a highly coded language in their speeches  interviews  and articles — filled with careful phrasing and hidden meanings. Today  AI-powered tools and applications are on the market that analyze the words  tone  voice modulation  gestures  and subtle hints used by central bankers. These systems cross-reference current statements with past remarks and data to decode the true message behind their communication. Major investment firms  banks  and analysts pay large sums for these advanced AI tools to predict the next moves of central banks with greater accuracy.,neutral,0.0,0.92,0.07,mixed,0.2,0.19,0.61,True,English,"['resistance fighters', 'triple power', 'dream', 'Zoi', 'Nikos', 'Charitsis', 'Pierre', 'contacts', 'USA', 'ships', 'former European Council President Charles Michel', 'former ONNED vice-president', 'agricultural payments agency', 'Christian Orthodox character', 'one possible candidate', 'labor Middle Ages', 'Possible Price Reductions', '10 major retail chains', 'political leaders’ debate', 'Kerameos’ labor bill', 'The Mediterranean Conference', 'The Labor Bill', 'two ND governments', 'Political Committee', 'resistance” wing', 'New Democracy', 'new thing', 'coastal states', 'old idea', 'relevant parties', 'Cyprus’ participation', 'plenary hall', 'foreign affairs', 'long chat', 'driving force', 'Plefsi Eleftherias', 'dynamic move', 'The Monastery', 'bilateral agreement', 'new abbot', 'Patriarch Theophilos', 'peculiar role', 'church actors', 'Panagiotis Lembesis', 'Prefectural Committee', 'Northern Sector', 'internal contest', 'Pantelis Stergiannis', 'Giannis Maniatis', 'General Director', 'Asset Management', '13-hour workday', 'More Products', 'product codes', 'recent action', 'supermarket representatives', 'discreet pressure', 'consumer response', 'political trio', 'same party', 'party member', 'prime minister', 'Minister Gerapetritis', 'Development Minister', 'Karamanlis’ office', 'life goal', 'K.M.', 'brief announcement', 'Deputy Secretary', 'roll-call vote', 'several articles', 'consumer goods', 'food industry', 'son Mitsotakis', 'Mitsotakis loyalist', 'joint initiative', 'Foreign Ministry', 'Sinai brotherhood', 'same source', 'Kωνστα', 'Newsroom', 'Rafina', 'brat', 'variation', 'theme', 'Samaras', 'Pollsters', 'elections', 'optimism', 'everyone', 'history', 'father', 'something', 'institutions', 'danger', 'country', 'SYRIZA', 'friend', 'Tsipras', 'Mimi', 'Justice', 'days', 'nights', 'Prokopis', 'Karahalios', 'remark', 'speech', 'Greece', 'intention', 'region', 'forum', 'reality', 'Turkey', 'Israel', 'mind', 'Triole-power', 'sidelines', 'Androulakis', 'Zoe', 'Charitsis', 'sources', 'Course', 'Freedom', 'Nikos', 'OPEKEPE', 'field', 'piece', 'arrangement', 'Egypt', 'safeguarding', 'issue', 'spotlight', 'progress', 'movement', 'approval', 'Sunday', 'Jerusalem', 'ordination', 'Symeon', 'place', 'board', 'Promotion', 'Reorganization', 'Skrekas', 'head', 'Maintenance', 'ADMIE', 'Farce', 'opposition', 'monstrosity', 'nightmare', '180 MPs', 'three-fifths', 'parliament', 'prices', 'number', 'Christmas', 'meetings', 'multinationals', 'latter', 'Talks', 'DIMEA', 'inspections', 'supermarkets', 'labels', 'retailers', '70 suppliers', 'λο']",2025-10-17,2025-10-18,en.protothema.gr
