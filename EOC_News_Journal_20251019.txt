It secured a $15.5 billion IMF loan in 2023  but the program runs out in 2027. Last month  Kiev requested a new $8 billion package  but the talks have reportedly stalled over the currency issue.According to Bloomberg  the IMF believes a controlled devaluation of the hryvnia could ease Ukraine’s financial strain by boosting budget revenues in local-currency terms. However  sources at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reportedly see limited benefit in such a move  given the country’s reliance on foreign aid  fearing a devaluation could spark inflation and thus public unrest.The issue was reportedly discussed during the IMF’s annual meetings in Washington this week  with further talks expected next month. Both the IMF and the NBU declined to comment on the report.The IMF earlier warned that Kiev faces a widening funding gap requiring billions more in aid to sustain its war effort. Bloomberg reported that Ukraine has raised its financing needs to about $65 billion  a figure it has shared with the EU  which is currently its main sponsor. Brussels plans to cover much of the gap with the revenues generated by Russia’s frozen central-bank funds.Western nations froze about $300 billion in Russian assets in 2022  including €200 billion ($209 billion) at the EU-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The G7 later backed using interest from those funds to guarantee $50 billion in loans for Ukraine. This month  EU finance ministers discussed tapping the assets for another €140 billion loan  to be repaid if Kiev receives “reparations” from Moscow. The proposal  which some members warn carries legal and fiscal risks  will be reviewed at next week’s EU summit.Moscow has denounced the plan as akin to “theft ” noting it would violate international law and undermine trust in the Western financial system. The Kremlin warned Western military and financial aid to Kiev only prolongs the conflict.,neutral,0.01,0.74,0.25,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['IMF', 'Kiev', 'currency', 'Bloomberg', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'EU-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'new $8 billion package', 'new loan package', 'widening funding gap', 'EU finance ministers', 'Western financial system', '$15.5 billion IMF loan', '€140 billion loan', 'international law', 'The G7', 'The Kremlin', 'financial strain', 'Western nations', 'Western military', 'The IMF', 'financial aid', 'Western aid', 'military costs', 'local-currency terms', 'National Bank', 'limited benefit', 'public unrest', 'annual meetings', 'war effort', 'financing needs', 'main sponsor', 'fiscal risks', 'next week', 'EU summit', 'foreign aid', 'controlled devaluation', 'central-bank funds', 'Russian assets', 'currency issue', 'budget revenues', 'Ukraine', 'request', 'jeopardy', 'hryvnia', 'order', 'Bloomberg', 'Friday', 'sources', 'conflict', 'everything', 'pensions', 'program', 'Kiev', 'talks', 'NBU', 'move', 'country', 'reliance', 'inflation', 'Washington', 'report', 'billions', 'figure', 'Brussels', 'interest', 'loans', 'reparations', 'Moscow', 'proposal', 'members', 'legal', 'plan', 'trust']",2025-10-18,2025-10-19,rt.com

The latest is a cross-boundary bond repurchase (repo) arrangement launched last month.Over the years  there have been a number of projects and reforms designed to promote international use of the currency  including the stock connect scheme rolled out in 2014  which allowed cross-border trading of stocks between Hong Kong and Shanghai.As of August this year  the yuan was the second most-used currency in global trade finance  with a 7.6 per cent share  second only to the US dollar at 81.4 per cent  according to Swift  the banking industry's messaging network system. The yuan's share was 6 per cent last December and only 2.1 per cent four years ago.Although the yuan   officially called renminbi  is not fully convertible  Beijing had begun since 2009 to allow international investors to use the currency for trade settlement. It has come a long way since then.In December  the scheme will be expanded to include direct investments for mainland firms to secure yuan loans to invest overseas or for foreign firms to get yuan funding to expand on the mainland.Sunny Yip Yuk-chik poses in front of his sewage treatment plant in Zhaoqing on October 9  2019.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge   our new platform of curated content with explainers  FAQs  analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""I would consider a yuan loan to expand my business on the mainland because it avoids the exchange rate risks and the cost is cheaper than loans in Hong Kong dollars "" said Yip  who operates a sewage treatment plant in Zhaoqing in the Greater Bay Area .Earlier this month  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion) Renminbi Business Facility (RBF) that would enable business owners like Yip to borrow yuan from Hong Kong banks for up to 12 months at the onshore yuan interest rate  easing trade settlements.When Hong Kong businessman Sunny Yip Yuk-chik heard about a new scheme that would make it easier and cheaper to borrow Chinese yuan  he immediately called his staff on the Chinese mainland with the news.Story ContinuesHong Kong is the largest offshore yuan market worldwide  with 76 per cent of offshore yuan payments in August conducted in the city  according to Swift. Hong Kong's banks had 968 billion in yuan deposits as of August  16 per cent higher than the 837 billion yuan in January 2023  when the city reopened its border after the Covid-19 pandemic.Yuan remittances via Hong Kong for trade settlements rose 62 per cent during the same period to 997 billion yuan in August  according to data from the HKMA.The new bond repo scheme allows more than 800 international institutional investors in the northbound Bond Connect scheme to use onshore holdings that are sub-custodied at the Central Moneymarkets Unit of HKMA as collateral to secure funding from the onshore repo market. They can then use the onshore yuan in offshore markets such as Hong Kong.""All these measures were aimed at promoting three directions in the yuan businesses  namely to create an ecosystem for investment  financing and hedging the currency "" said Charles Lam  Citi's Hong Kong head of markets  who was involved in the discussions leading to the launch of the repo connect scheme.Charles Lam  Citi's Hong Kong head of markets  is interviewed at his office in Central  October 13  2025.

Photo: Sun Yeung>This would substantially boost the supply of yuan for international investors  leading to more stability in the interest rate market for offshore yuan  Lam said. ""The pricing differentials between the onshore yuan and offshore yuan would also be narrowed "" he added.Regulators are pushing reforms to promote the yuan business amid decreasing demand for US dollar assets  according to Cusson Leung  chief investment officer of KGI  a Hong Kong and Singapore-based financial firm.""Global investors are losing confidence in putting all their assets in the US dollar after President Donald Trump started the trade war in April "" Leung said. ""Investors want to invest in gold  China and Hong Kong stocks  as well as assets in other currencies  including the yuan.""""This would encourage more investors to buy yuan-denominated dim sum bonds  while other business sectors would be more willing to use the yuan to settle trade and make investments "" Leung said  adding that it was positive for Hong Kong as it would strengthen the city as an offshore yuan trading centre.HSBC and Standard Chartered were among the first lenders to participate in the cross-border bond repo market.""The new repo arrangement is a 'win-win' for both foreign institutional investors and mainland lenders "" said Wong Tsz-Cheuk  head of markets and securities services at HSBC Hong Kong.Wong said the repo arrangement was a typical way for mainland banks to lend yuan to other banks or investors  as they rely on collateral such as government bonds and other high-quality bonds as risk mitigation. The asset management companies  insurers and banks which invest through bond connect were qualified to tap funds from the repo under the new scheme.It would also lower the cost of yuan funding for international investors because the offshore yuan interest rate was higher during times of stress  and the pool was smaller than the onshore yuan  Wong said. The offshore yuan's implied interest rate reached 8 per cent at the start of this year compared with the onshore rate of 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent.""While banks can get their yuan funding easier and cheaper  it would also encourage them to introduce more yuan loans and other yuan products "" Wong said. ""For mainland banks  it would create new business opportunities for them as they can lend out their yuan to international investors to earn more interest income.""Citi's Lam said the next step would be to develop a central clearing agency to settle all repo lending among investors and lenders  as this would reduce counterparty risks and documentation  and standardise the current bilateral repo arrangement between banks.Europe and the US had their own central clearing agencies for bonds and repo arrangements  so Hong Kong should push to take the lead as a regional clearing centre  Lam said.A bank employee count yuan notes next to US dollar notes in Bangkok  Thailand  January 26  2023.

It included plans for a central clearing agency to replace the bilateral lending agreement between banks  but the timeline was not yet fixed.Philippe Dirckx  managing director and head of fixed income at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Asifma)  supported the move.""The next step is to connect mainland China and Hong Kong's market infrastructure with international systems such as Euroclear  Clearstream and global custodians  enabling Chinese government bonds held in Hong Kong to be used as collateral globally "" Dirckx said.""This cross-border triparty connectivity is crucial for the full internationalisation of Chinese bonds  allowing assets under Bond Connect to serve financing and margin needs not just in mainland China and Hong Kong  but across major global markets "" he said.Dirckx added that the new measures highlighted the commitment by Chinese regulators to make Hong Kong a ""true regional liquidity hub  not just for RMB cash clearing  but also as an issuance  secondary market and collateral centre"".The measures have proved popular. Sewage treatment businessman Yip is not alone in finding the RMB Business Facility useful. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia)  the Hong Kong arm of the nation's biggest bank  conducted a number of transactions for clients using the facility on the first day of its launch on October 9.They included companies in energy  metals and papermaking  as well as institutional clients of key domestic and overseas ICBC branches in Guangdong  Singapore and Dubai.""The introduction of the RMB Business Facility will further optimise the offshore RMB liquidity supply mechanism in response to market demand  effectively alleviating liquidity constraints and interest rate fluctuations in the offshore RMB market "" said Duan Mengche  assistant chief executive of ICBC (Asia). She noted that the bank had provided nearly 120 billion yuan in trade financing for its customers since 2024.""Our clients have expressed that this enhancement provides a more stable  preferential and flexible source of RMB funding "" she said.The new measures would also help Hong Kong to further develop its foreign exchange and bond markets  according to analysts.When veteran foreign currency trader Jasper Lo Cho-yan started trading in 1987  the currencies he dealt with included the pound  Japanese yen  Australian dollar and Deutsche mark; the yuan was not among them.A woman walks past a sign showing the Chinese yuan and the US dollar symbols in Hong Kong on November 28  2012.

""While Singapore and London are bigger than Hong Kong in terms of overall foreign currency [trading]  they cannot compete with Hong Kong in terms of yuan trading.""The internationalisation of the yuan is why Hong Kong was able to keep its position as the fourth largest foreign currency trading market worldwide last year  up from the seventh in the early 2000s  according to Lo.David Yim Sau-king  head of debt capital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered  pointed out that in July Beijing allowed non-bank financial institutions  such as insurance companies and asset managers  to invest in bonds in Hong Kong via the southbound route of the Bond Connect  boosting liquidity in the market.""This can potentially provide a huge amount of liquidity in the dim sum bond markets "" Yim said.When Yip set up his treatment plant in China in 2016  he borrowed about HK$20 million (US$2.6 million) from banks in Hong Kong but had to exchange it into yuan to invest on the mainland.With the new RMB facility  Yip has been arranging meetings with his bankers in Hong Kong to explore opportunities for a yuan loan.""Although we can get bank loans in China nowadays after operating there for a decade  we would still like to get loans in Hong Kong as the local bankers understand the needs of Hong Kong enterprises "" he said.Additional reporting by Aileen ChuangThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP)  the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
