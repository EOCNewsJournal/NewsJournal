With Ukraine's economy devastated by the exogenous shock of Russian aggression  Western leaders ha…,Supporting Ukraine with a reparations loan drawing on frozen Russian funds is the right choice not only morally  financially  and legally  but also politically. With Ukraine's economy devastated by the exogenous shock of Russian aggression  Western leaders have a chance to show that they are equal to the moment.WASHINGTON  DC – Rarely do Western political leaders impress us with decisive resolve in the face of geopolitical problems. More often  their response is to express deep concern without mustering the courage to intervene and minimize their costs.But there have been exceptions. On a few occasions in modern history  Western leaders truly proved equal to the moment. One example was in March 2022  when Western governments intervened decisively to immobilize most Russian sovereign assets (RSAs) held outside Russia. An estimated $300 billion (€260 billion) was frozen  with the bulk of it in the European Union  primarily in Belgium (Euroclear). Those funds have remained frozen in all affected countries  and thanks to bipartisan congressional leadership in the United States  the president is authorized to seize  confiscate  and transfer all Russian sovereign assets within US jurisdiction to aid Ukraine.Western leaders impressed us again at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in June 2024  when they agreed to provide a $50 billion Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loan  backed by the revenue generated by the frozen Russian assets. This breakthrough involved a series of national commitments and guarantees  not least from the US  which helped spearhead the effort.Today  most of the ERA funds have been disbursed to Ukraine  which has used them to support an economy devastated by the exogenous shock of Russian aggression. As of early October 2025  they constituted the country’s third-largest source of external financing  behind only the EU and the US. But despite these efforts  the war rages on  and Ukraine urgently needs tens of billions of dollars more to defend against relentless Russian attacks  and to underwrite its economic survival.Back in 2022  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that the war carried echoes of the Manichean struggle depicted in Star Wars. Ultimately  he declared  “the light will win over darkness.” Fast forward to September 2025  and US President Donald Trump seemed to agree that with the support of Europe  the Ukrainians can indeed “fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form.”Yet Ukraine cannot achieve this victory without immediate  large-scale financial assistance from its Western allies. As Chrystia Freeland  Canada’s former deputy prime minister and current representative for Ukrainian reconstruction  recently argued  the West “need[s] to work with Ukraine today  to support it and its war economy  and to lay the foundations for its future prosperity.”Fall Sale: Save 40% on a PS new subscription PS_Sales_FallSale2025 Fall Sale: Save 40% on a PS new subscription For a limited time  you can gain greater access to Project Syndicate – including every new PS commentary  our entire suite of subscriber-exclusive content  the full PS archive  and more – starting at just $49.99 for your first year. SUBSCRIBE NOWSo  Western leaders again have an opportunity to act decisively. The frozen Russian assets can support Ukraine’s military and economic needs  even without full legal confiscation. In fact  the first steps in this direction have already been taken. In her State of Europe address last month  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the immobilized cash sitting in Euroclear – approximately €170 billion – to be made immediately available to Ukraine through a reparations loan  in conjunction with the country’s next International Monetary Fund program.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also recently voiced support for a similar approach  proposing “an interest-free loan” secured by the frozen Russian assets  to “be repaid only once Russia has compensated Ukraine for the damage it has caused during this war.” These newly mobilized funds  he stressed  would be sufficient to “secure Ukraine’s defense capabilities for several years.”Moreover  European Council President António Costa  High Representative Kaja Kallas  and Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo have all endorsed this idea in the name of defending international law and norms. And during their recent virtual meeting in Ottawa  the G7 ministers of finance declared that they are ready to develop “a wide range of options to address Ukraine’s financing needs and to ensure that Russia cannot wait it out. Amongst others  these measures include using  in a coordinated way  the full value of the RSAs immobilized in our jurisdictions.”Our advice to Western leaders is to seize the moment and follow through. They can impress us once more by making a “concrete decision” at the European Council meeting later this month. A reparations loan drawing on frozen Russian funds is the right choice morally  financially  and legally. It is also good politics. Today’s Western leaders can meet this moment in history  just as the victorious Allied leaders did in the last century.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.17,0.63,True,English,"['The Right Way', 'Ukraine', 'Defense', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Council President António Costa', 'Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo', 'next International Monetary Fund program', 'former deputy prime minister', 'immediate, large-scale financial assistance', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'High Representative Kaja Kallas', '$50 billion Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration', 'US President Donald Trump', 'most Russian sovereign assets', 'European Council meeting', 'bipartisan congressional leadership', 'recent virtual meeting', 'relentless Russian attacks', 'full legal confiscation', 'G7 Leaders’ Summit', 'frozen Russian assets', 'full PS archive', 'Western political leaders', 'new PS commentary', 'frozen Russian funds', 'European Union', 'international law', 'current representative', 'Ukrainian reconstruction', 'Russian aggression', 'full value', 'G7 ministers', 'Western leaders', 'new subscription', 'Western governments', 'Western allies', 'reparations loan', 'right choice', 'exogenous shock', 'decisive resolve', 'geopolitical problems', 'deep concern', 'One example', 'United States', 'US jurisdiction', 'ERA) loan', 'national commitments', 'ERA funds', 'early October', 'largest source', 'external financing', 'economic survival', 'Manichean struggle', 'Star Wars', 'original form', 'Chrystia Freeland', 'future prosperity', 'Fall Sale', 'limited time', 'greater access', 'Project Syndicate', 'entire suite', 'subscriber-exclusive content', 'first year', 'economic needs', 'first steps', 'similar approach', 'interest-free loan', 'defense capabilities', 'several years', 'wide range', 'financing needs', 'coordinated way', 'concrete decision', 'good politics', 'modern history', 'Europe address', 'war economy', 'Ukraine', 'moment', 'WASHINGTON', 'DC', 'face', 'response', 'courage', 'costs', 'exceptions', 'occasions', 'March', 'RSAs', 'bulk', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'countries', 'June', 'breakthrough', 'series', 'guarantees', 'effort', 'country', 'tens', 'billions', 'dollars', 'echoes', 'light', 'darkness', 'September', 'support', 'Ukrainians', 'victory', 'Canada', 'foundations', 'opportunity', 'military', 'fact', 'direction', 'immobilized', 'cash', 'conjunction', 'damage', 'idea', 'name', 'norms', 'Ottawa', 'finance', 'options', 'others', 'measures', 'jurisdictions', 'advice', 'jus']",2025-10-20,2025-10-21,project-syndicate.org
53278,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/10/20/eu-members-need-to-step-up-financial-aid-to-ukraine/,EU members ‘need to step up’ financial aid to Ukraine,Denmark says some states not pulling their weight  as EU ministers discuss using frozen Russian assets to assist Kyiv,Some European states are not pulling their weight when it comes to providing financial support to Ukraine and greater “burden sharing” is needed  Denmark’s foreign minister  Lars Løkke Rasmussen has said.As EU states are expected to face pressure to step up aid to Ukraine  given increasingly conditional support provided by US president Donald Trump  foreign ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday to continue discussions on a plan to use frozen Russian state assets to fund a huge loan to Kyiv.The loan would be guaranteed on the back of €170 billion in Russia central bank assets  which were frozen in Europe by economic sanctions after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.The funds would only be paid back to Russia if it agreed to compensate Ukraine for the damage caused by the war.In September  Ukraine estimated it would need $50 billion (€43 billion) in external support for 2026.Belgium has several reservations about the plan  fearing its exposure as the host of Euroclear  a Belgian securities depository where the Russian assets in question are immobilised.The Belgian government is insisting on legal guarantees that EU states would jointly agree to bear the cost of any legal challenge to the loan from Russia  or any future penalties.Speaking on Monday  Mr Rasmussen said he hoped there would be a breakthrough on the reparations loan “as soon as possible”.Separately  the Danish foreign minister said some EU states needed to up the amount of financial aid they were providing to Ukraine.“We have an issue with burden sharing among the European countries  Denmark is doing a lot  some other countries are doing similar to us  others should step up  we will push for that ” he said.European politicians are nervously waiting to see what will come from a meeting of Mr Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the coming weeks in Budapest.Officials fear the summit will undo months of diplomatic work by Ukraine and Europe to convince Mr Trump that Russia is holding up the prospects of peace in the war. Plans for a Trump-Putin meeting came just as Ukraine felt it was close to securing a supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles from the US.Ukraine remained convinced that Mr Trump “wants to end this war on fair terms”  Dutch minister for foreign affairs David van Weel said. The US president was the “key figure” who could get people around a negotiating table  he said.Kaja Kallas  the EU’s top representative on foreign affairs  said she would have preferred if Mr Putin had agreed to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for talks.Russia would only seriously talk about a ceasefire deal when put under pressure  she said.The former Estonian prime minister said allowing Russia to come out on top in any peace deal would “signal to all the aggressors in the world that you can go and take what you want”.Ms Kallas  who chairs the meetings of EU foreign ministers  said work was continuing on what would be the 19th round of economic sanctions  aimed at hobbling Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine. The sanctions target Russia’s oil and gas industry and a “shadow fleet” of ships Moscow uses to evade previous sanctions on its oil exports.Slovakia’s populist prime minister  Robert Fico  is using a national veto to hold up the new measures on Russia  seeking concessions from Brussels on energy supply.Speaking on Monday  Ms Kallas said she was hopeful a summit of the EU’s 27 leaders on Thursday would land an agreement to approve the fresh sanctions.EU officials were drawing up “solidarity measures” that would address Belgium’s concerns about the Ukraine reparations loan  she said.,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.0,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['EU members', 'financial aid', 'Ukraine', 'Lars Løkke Rasmussen', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'Russian leader Vladimir Putin', 'former Estonian prime minister', 'Russia central bank assets', 'US president Donald Trump', 'populist prime minister', 'long-range Tomahawk missiles', 'David van Weel', 'The US president', 'Belgian securities depository', 'Danish foreign minister', 'greater “burden sharing', 'EU foreign ministers', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine reparations loan', 'Mr Rasmussen', 'Mr Putin', 'Ukrainian president', 'Dutch minister', 'Belgian government', 'Mr Trump', 'foreign affairs', 'European states', 'financial support', 'conditional support', 'full-scale invasion', 'external support', 'several reservations', 'legal guarantees', 'legal challenge', 'future penalties', 'European countries', 'other countries', 'European politicians', 'coming weeks', 'fair terms', 'key figure', 'negotiating table', 'Kaja Kallas', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'ceasefire deal', 'Ms Kallas', '19th round', 'gas industry', 'shadow fleet', 'Robert Fico', 'national veto', 'new measures', 'solidarity measures', 'EU states', 'huge loan', 'economic sanctions', 'previous sanctions', 'fresh sanctions', 'financial aid', 'diplomatic work', 'Trump-Putin meeting', 'top representative', 'peace deal', 'oil exports', 'energy supply', 'EU officials', 'weight', 'Denmark', 'pressure', 'Luxembourg', 'Monday', 'discussions', 'plan', 'Kyiv', 'back', 'Moscow', 'early', 'funds', 'damage', 'war', 'September', 'Belgium', 'exposure', 'host', 'Euroclear', 'question', 'cost', 'breakthrough', 'amount', 'issue', 'lot', 'others', 'Budapest', 'summit', 'months', 'prospects', 'people', 'talks', 'aggressors', 'world', 'meetings', 'ability', 'ships', 'Slovakia', 'concessions', 'Brussels', '27 leaders', 'Thursday', 'agreement', 'concerns']",2025-10-20,2025-10-21,irishtimes.com

If we don’t make a deal ... a lot of people are going to be paying a big price”.European leaders will hold a summit on Thursday in Brussels  potentially with Mr Zelenskiy  aiming to agree on using immobilised Russian assets for a €140 billion loan to Ukraine  which German chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested be used solely to arm Kyiv.EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday voiced support for Ukraine  saying the bloc must agree the use of Russian frozen assets and a further round of sanctions against Moscow.“The EU should put Ukraine in a strong starting position by providing military assistance  by looking at how we can use the financial assets to give them some kind of financial alleviation in order for them to have the best cards at the table ” said David van Weel  the Dutch foreign minister.[ ‘He will destroy you’: Trump urged Zelenskiy to accept Putin terms at White House meetingOpens in new window ]EU officials are confident that the Thursday summit will give the green light to the European Commission to put forward a proposal on lending the money in tranches  which will be used to buy weapons.Hungary’s pro-Russian prime minister Viktor Orban will be absent from the early part of the summit to attend a national holiday  allowing the other 26 leaders to potentially agree without him.French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot told reporters that the funding would “give Ukraine the means to defend itself for at least three years”.Mr Zelenskiy said in comments to reporters published on Monday that he had been told by European counterparts of their full support. “We’ll meet this week ” he said. “The Europeans will have a unified position with Ukraine – and that’s very important.”But Belgium  which holds the vast majority of Russia’s frozen assets at the Euroclear central depository  has said it will not sign off on their use unless it has guarantees that other member states will foot the bill if Moscow’s legal challenges succeeded.The Kremlin this month strongly condemned the idea of using frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine  describing it as “the unlawful seizure of Russian property – or  to put it simply  theft”  and threatening legal action.EU governments are also still at odds over the next round of sanctions against Moscow  which include a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas from January  with Slovakia objecting until it secures further concessions.Countries with the exception of Slovakia and Hungary on Monday agreed on a complete European phase-out of Russian gas by 2028.The eventual ban would allow the EU to “gain its energy independence” and “not least to support Ukraine”  said EU energy commissioner Dan Jørgensen.Bratislava would not lift its veto until the commission promised to take action to cut energy costs and support the bloc’s ailing car industry  said Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.In a bid to placate Slovakia  commission president Ursula von der Leyen has offered to review a landmark 2035 ban on new cars with combustion engines by the end of this year and to help alleviate the high cost of energy. But diplomats said that Bratislava had not relented following that offer.Western leaders in the “coalition of the willing” will also hold a call with Mr Zelenskiy on Friday over more military support.After Mr Trump refused to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles last week  Mr Zelenskiy said he hoped European allies would step up  pointing that “such weapons aren’t held only by the United States”.“If the United States takes a step forward  the Russians understand that I can arrange Tomahawks and other necessary weapons in Europe as well ” Mr Zelenskiy said.He said he had briefed European leaders “immediately after” the meeting Mr Trump: “They want to address him with such requests themselves. We remain in constant co-ordination.”Mr Trump on Monday said “it’s turned out to be nasty  because you have two leaders [Mr Zelenskiy and Mr Putin] that truly hate each other. You can’t have it all. They hate each other beyond all else  and it actually makes it a little bit difficult”.Asked whether he had told Russia to stop its attacks on Ukrainian civilians  he said: “I did.” – Additional reporting by Anastasia StogneiCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2025,negative,0.01,0.31,0.68,mixed,0.1,0.27,0.64,True,English,"['tense Donald Trump meeting', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Europeans', 'defence', 'pro-Russian prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico', 'German chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian liquefied natural gas', 'tense White House meeting', 'Dutch foreign minister', 'White House meetingOpens', 'French foreign minister', 'David van Weel', 'Jean-Noël Barrot', 'Euroclear central depository', 'Dan Jørgensen', 'ailing car industry', 'Tomahawk long-range missiles', 'strong starting position', 'complete European phase-out', 'EU foreign ministers', 'other member states', 'Russian frozen assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other necessary weapons', 'EU energy commissioner', 'Russian gas', 'other 26 leaders', 'Russian presidents', 'Russian property', 'unified position', 'United States', 'financial assets', 'European governments', 'European Union', 'European leaders', 'European counterparts', 'European allies', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Kaja Kallas', 'top diplomat', 'Ms Kallas', 'Financial Times', 'Mr Putin', 'coming weeks', 'EU members', 'financial aid', 'new window', 'big price', '€140 billion loan', 'military assistance', 'financial alleviation', 'best cards', 'Putin terms', 'EU officials', 'green light', 'early part', 'national holiday', 'three years', 'The Europeans', 'vast majority', 'legal challenges', 'The Kremlin', 'unlawful seizure', 'EU governments', 'energy independence', 'energy costs', 'new cars', 'combustion engines', 'high cost', 'Western leaders', 'constant co-ordination', 'two leaders', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Mr Zelenskiy', 'Donald Trump', 'president Trump', 'Mr Trump', 'European Commission', 'full support', 'eventual ban', 'commission president', 'landmark 2035 ban', 'military support', 'Ukrainian leader', 'maximalist requests', 'territorial concessions', 'legal action', 'next round', 'Thursday summit', 'peace deal', 'demands', 'war', 'efforts', 'Ukraine', 'Monday', 'Friday', 'counterarguments', 'reach', 'Budapest', 'reporters', 'lot', 'people', 'Brussels', 'Kyiv', 'Luxembourg', 'bloc', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'kind', 'order', 'table', 'proposal', 'money', 'tranches', 'Hungary', 'funding', 'means', 'comments', 'Belgium', 'guarantees', 'idea', 'odds', 'January', 'Countries', 'exception', 'Bratislava', 'veto', 'bid', 'diplomats', 'offer', 'coalition', 'willing', 'call', 'step', 'Russians', 'Tomahawks']",2025-10-20,2025-10-21,irishtimes.com

Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA) intravenous (IV) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab[*])  was well tolerated and showed positive local  abscopal and sustained antitumoral activity in injected and non-injected lesions.Translational analyses reveal increased T cell chemoattractants in the blood and infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells and macrophages in tumors after treatment with BT-001 in combination with pembrolizumab. Significant tumor shrinkage (≥30% decrease in longest diameter) was observed in five of 16 injected lesions (in three patients with melanoma and one patient with sarcoma). Four patients had tumor shrinkage of non-injected lesions.Long-lasting partial responses (PRs) were observed in a patient with melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy and in a heavily pre-treated  PD-L1 negative leiomyosarcoma patient.These immune-mediated tumor shrinkages are consistent with the mechanistic hypothesis that BT-001  in combination with pembrolizumab  turns “cold” tumors into immunologically active ones. The overall data support further development of BT-001 across a range of solid tumors to improve responses to cancer immunotherapies.Prof. Celeste Lebbé  Dermatologist and Venereologist  Head of Dermatology Department at Hospital Saint-Louis  Paris  commented: “Many cancer patients fail to respond to existing treatments  emphasizing the urgent need for new approaches. BT-001 represents a promising new class of immunotherapy  capable of inducing a potent local immune response through the expression of GM-CSF and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody. These clinical data provide compelling proof of concept  highlighting the relevance of this oncolytic virus in transforming cold tumors into immunologically active ones. Whether administered alone or in combination with pembrolizumab  BT-001 offers the potential to expand treatment options with a favorable safety profile across multiple tumor types.”Dr. Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  said: “We are pleased to jointly present these clinical data on BT-001 at ESMO 2025  demonstrating encouraging antitumor activity in patients with solid  refractory solid tumors. These updated results confirm BT-001’s mechanism of action as a single agent administered via intra-tumoral injection and show early signs of clinical benefit  including lesion shrinkage and stable disease. With a favorable safety profile - both alone and in combination with pembrolizumab - BT-001 could represent an effective option to enhance responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with limited treatment alternatives. Together with our partner BioInvent  we will continue to explore its safety and efficacy and share further data as it becomes available.”Andres McAllister  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer at BioInvent  added: “By combining BT-001 with pembrolizumab  we are building upon the promising data generated by BT-001 as a single agent. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in addition to BT-001’s mechanism of action is expected to further stimulate and restore the patient’s immune system  which should result in improved antitumoral activity and patient outcome. We are pleased to pursue clinical development opportunities with clinicians and further demonstrate the potential of this novel oncolytic virus.”Transgene and BioInvent are co-developing BT-001  an oncolytic virus developed using Transgene’s Invir.IO® platform armed to express GM-CSF and BioInvent’s full-length anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody  to elicit a strong and effective anti-tumoral response in solid tumors.The poster titled: “Updated clinical results of BT-001  an oncolytic virus expressing an anti-CTLA4 mAb  administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.”  can be accessed at the websites for the ESMO conference  Transgene and BioInvent.***ContactsTransgene: Media: Investors & Analysts: Caroline Tosch Lucie Larguier Corporate and Scientific Communications Manager Chief Financial Officer (CFO) +33 (0)3 68 33 27 38 Nadege Bartoli communication@transgene.fr Investor Relations Analystand Financial Communications Officer MEDiSTRAVA +33 (0)3 88 27 91 00/03 Frazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi investorrelations@transgene.fr + 44 (0)203 928 6900 transgene@medistrava.com BioInvent Cecilia Hofvander VP Investor Relations +46 (0)46 286 85 50 cecilia.hofvander@bioinvent.comAbout TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

New data from the FLUNITY-HD study  published on October 17 in The Lancet  demonstrated that Sanofi's Efluelda (known as Fluzone High-Dose in North America) significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization in adults 65 years and older compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines. The largest study of its kind  conducted across multiple seasons  FLUNITY-HD provides robust evidence that the high-dose influenza vaccine offers superior protection compared to standard-dose:8.8% (95% CI  1.7 to 15.5; one-sided p=0.008) additional protection against pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations6.3% (95% CI  2.5 to 10.0; p<0.001) additional reduction in hospitalizations for cardio-respiratory events31.9% (95% CI  19.7 to 42.2; p<0.001) additional reduction in lab-confirmed influenza hospitalizations2.2% (95% CI  0.3 to 4.1; p=0.012) additional protection against all-cause hospitalizations  meaning one additional hospitalization could be averted for every 515 (95% CI  278 to 3 929) individuals vaccinated with Efluelda instead of standard-dose.""The FLUNITY-HD study  unparalleled in its design and scale  harnesses the power and scientific rigor of individual randomization in real-world settings ” shared Professor Tor Biering-Sørensen  Cardiologist  Chief Investigator  and sponsor of the FLUNITY-HD study. “This first-of-its-kind study assessed the benefits of the high-dose influenza vaccine against severe outcomes compared to standard-dose  including against cardio-respiratory hospitalizations  in a randomized setting  covering two geographic areas. The results provide critical evidence  potentially reshaping public health strategies and clinical guidelines.""Professor Federico Martinon-Torres  Co-Principal Investigator of FLUNITY-HD study  added  “This new evidence reinforces the clinical confidence healthcare professionals have that the high-dose influenza vaccine achieves superior protection over standard-dose against severe outcomes in older adults  a group considered vulnerable due to having a weakened immune system and a higher risk of developing serious complications after flu infection.""Beyond clinical evidence  these findings point to potential public health and societal benefits.“Adults 65 and older represent up to 70% of flu hospitalizations. The FLUNITY-HD data confirm that our high-dose flu vaccine provides superior protection against hospitalizations compared to standard-dose vaccines in older adults ” said Bogdana Coudsy  MD  Global Head of Medical  Sanofi  Vaccines. “For every 515 older adults who receive our high-dose flu vaccine instead of standard-dose vaccines  one all-cause hospitalization is prevented. This can mean a lot  especially for vulnerable seniors  decreasing the burden on their quality of life and helping them to maintain their autonomy for longer. Additionally  preventing influenza hospitalizations may bring societal benefits such as lower healthcare costs  less pressure on medical systems  and reduced burden on caregivers.”With the addition of these new data  comprehensive research on our high-dose influenza vaccine covers 15 years of clinical evidence spanning over 45 million older adults.About the FLUNITY-HD StudyFLUNITY-HD is a pre-specified pooled analysis of two pragmatic individually randomized trials involving 466 320 participants aged 65 and older: DANFLU-2 and GALFLU. DANFLU-2 was conducted over three influenza seasons (2022-23  2023-24 and 2024-25) with over 332 000 participants aged 65 and above in Denmark. GALFLU was conducted over two influenza seasons (2023-24 and 2024-25) with over 134 000 participants aged 65 to 79 in the region of Galicia in Spain.The largest influenza vaccine study of its kind  this multi-season analysis is designed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of Efluelda (high-dose influenza vaccine) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines in preventing hospitalizations  ensuring scientific rigor through individual randomization.FLUNITY-HD achieved its primary endpoint  demonstrating 8.8% additional protection against pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations (vs standard dose). Secondary endpoints include reduction in hospitalizations for cardio-respiratory events  lab-confirmed influenza hospitalizations and all-cause hospitalizations.About Efluelda / Fluzone High-DoseEfluelda is a high-dose influenza vaccine  indicated for adults aged 60 and older in Europe. It is also licensed under the brand name Fluzone High-Dose in North America where it is indicated for adults aged 65 and older.This high-dose influenza vaccine is specifically tailored for older adults whose immune systems gradually decline and weaken with age  increasing their risk for severe influenza-related illness and hospitalization compared with younger populations.

Because defective C1-Inhibitor does not adequately perform its regulatory function  a biochemical imbalance can occur and produce unwanted peptides that induce the capillaries to release fluids into surrounding tissue  thereby causing swelling or edema.2HAE is characterized by spontaneous and recurrent episodes of swelling (edema attacks) of the skin in different parts of the body  as well as in the airways and internal organs. Edema of the skin usually affects the extremities  the face  and the genitals. Almost all HAE patients suffer from bouts of severe abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting and diarrhea caused by swelling of the intestinal wall.3Edema of the throat  nose or tongue is particularly dangerous and potentially life-threatening and can lead to obstruction of the airway passages.4 Although there is currently no known cure for HAE  it is possible to treat the symptoms associated with angioedema attacks.5 HAE affects about 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 50 000 people worldwide.6 HAE is often misdiagnosed as the symptoms are similar to many other common conditions such as allergies or appendicitis resulting in diagnostic delay.7About RUCONEST®RUCONEST® is a recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) protein replacement therapy indicated for the treatment of acute attacks in adult and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). RUCONEST® is approved in the U.S.  Europe and the UK and is the only recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor worldwide.RUCONEST® is delivered intravenously and is immediately and completely bioavailable enabling rapid intervention at the onset of an HAE attack. At the recommended dose of 50 U/kg  RUCONEST® has been shown to normalize C1INH activity levels  which are clinically relevant in the treatment of HAE. By irreversibly binding to and deactivating key mediators such as coagulation factor FXII and kallikrein  RUCONEST® halts the production of bradykinin and other inflammatory peptides  thereby stopping the progression of the attack. RUCONEST® is not indicated for the treatment of laryngeal attacks  as effectiveness in this subset of patients was not established in clinical studies. 8Please see Full Prescribing Information and Patient Product Information hereAbout Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation9 10 11 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.12 13 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.14 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.12-15 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the U.S.  U.K.  Australia and Israel as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the coprimary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on the immune dysregulation and deficiency seen in these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.16 17 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Japan  Canada and several other countries for APDS. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS and in two Phase II clinical trials in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation. The safety and efficacy of leniolisib has not been established for PIDs with immune dysregulation beyond APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with rare  debilitating  and life-threatening diseases.

The study included two cohorts evaluating RLT-naïve and RLT-exposed patients. The primary efficacy endpoint across both cohorts was the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).The study's efficacy endpoints are based on local investigator assessment  per protocol. In addition  a blinded independent central review (BICR) was conducted subsequently. The key efficacy endpoints were met within both the investigator-assessed and BICR results.The following results were presented:RLT-Naïve(n=35) Investigator assessmentIndependent assessment (BICR) *DOR is determined only for participants who have achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1**Defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR or PR or SD per RECIST 1.1***OS assessment is independent of RECIST 1.1 criteria  so BICR is n/a ORR 60.0%(95% CI: 42.1-76.1) 57.1%(95% CI: 39.4-73.7) Duration of Response (DoR) per Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate (95% CI)* 71.9% for ≥ 24 months(95% CI: 44.6-87.4) 81.7% for ≥ 24 months(95% CI: 53.1-93.8) Complete Response (CR) - 2.9% Partial Response (PR) 60.0% 54.3% Stable Disease (SD) 34.3% 28.6% Disease control rate (DCR)** 94.3%(95% CI: 80.8-99.3) 85.7%(95% CI: 69.7-95.2) PFS 36-month PFS rate of 72.3%(95% CI: 53.3-84.5) 36-month PFS rate of 63.3%(95% CI: 40.3-79.4) OS 36-month OS rate of 88.2%(95% CI: 71.5-95.4) Not applicable***RLT-Exposed(n=26) Investigator assessmentIndependent assessment (BICR) *DOR is determined only for participants who have achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1**Defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR or PR or SD per RECIST 1.1***OS assessment is independent of RECIST 1.1 criteria  so BICR is n/a ORR 34.6%(95% CI: 17.2-55.7) 19.2%(95% CI: 6.6-39.4) Duration of Response (DoR) per Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate (95% CI)* 100% for ≥ 18 months(95% CI: 100-100) 100% for ≥ 18 months(95% CI: 100-100) Partial Response (PR) 34.6% 19.2% Stable Disease (SD) 61.5% 80.8% Disease control rate (DCR)** 96.2%(95% CI: 80.4-99.9) 100%(95% CI: 86.8-100) PFS 18-month PFS rate of 82.6%(95% CI: 59.0-93.3) 18-month PFS rate of 88%(95% CI: 67.3-96.0) OS 18-month OS rate of 85.1%(95% CI: 58.5-95.2) Not applicable***AlphaMedix™ had a similar safety profile across both cohorts. Within the RLT-naïve cohort  85.7% of patients received all four doses of AlphaMedix  and 84.6% of patients within the RLT-exposed cohort. All GEP-NET patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 42.3% of RLT-exposed patients and 54.3% of RLT-naïve patients. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs in both groups was lymphocyte count decrease (25.7% of RLT-naïve patients and 15.4% of RLT-exposed patients).“The future of oncology research will be driven by cutting-edge science and next-generation modalities  such as radioligand therapies. AlphaMedix  a promising targeted alpha therapy  embodies the type of solution Sanofi is working to advance ” said Christopher Corsico  MD  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “We are excited to share these robust scientific findings at ESMO as the data could represent a significant advancement in how we treat gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. As we engage with health authorities and advance the clinical program  we remain focused on bringing this innovative modality to patients who need new treatment options”Advancing AlphaMedix in GEP-NETsRLTs  which work by delivering radiation directly to tumor cells  represent an emerging area of oncology research. While current approved beta-emitting RLTs have improved outcomes in patients with GEP-NETs  there remains a critical gap in care  including in those who have progressed following previous RLT.TAT represents an innovative modality in RLT  harnessing high-energy  short-range alpha emissions to precisely target cancer cells while reducing potential exposure to surrounding tissue.""The results observed in the ALPHAMEDIX-02 trial clearly demonstrate exceptional levels of efficacy for a Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT)  based on current available therapies  in both radioligand therapy (RLT)-naïve and RLT-exposed populations and could potentially set new expectations when treating gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) patients with RLTs” said Ebrahim Delpassand  MD  Founder and Chairman  CEO of RadioMedix. “For too long  this patient population has experienced inadequate disease control with current approved therapies. This important work provides hope for a new treatment for GEP-NET patients  their caregivers  and their healthcare providers.”In February 2024  AlphaMedix™ was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration in RLT-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic GEP-NETs  recognizing the potential clinical benefits of lead-212–based TATs. The ALPHAMEDIX-02 results will form the basis for further discussions with health authorities.An international phase 3 study to further evaluate AlphaMedix in GEP-NETs is actively being planned. AlphaMedix is an investigational medicine and has not been approved by any regulatory authority.In September 2024  Sanofi entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to globally commercialize AlphaMedix.About the ALPHAMEDIX-02 studyALPHAMEDIX-02 is a phase 2  open-label  multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AlphaMedix (212Pb-DOTAMTATE) in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic GEP-NETs  positive somatostatin analogue imaging and at least one site of measurable disease. The study included two cohorts evaluating RLT-naïve (n=35) and RLT-exposed (n=26) GEP-NET patients. RLT-exposed patients had progressive disease after receiving up to four doses of 177Lu-DOTATATE and received their last dose at least six months prior to Day 1. In both cohorts  AlphaMedix was administered at 67.6 μCi/kg every eight weeks for up to four cycles (6 mCi maximum per cycle). The primary efficacy endpoint across both cohorts was ORR per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS and OS.About NETsNETs are a heterogeneous group of cancers that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These cancers occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but can also occur in other tissues including the thymus  lung  and other uncommon sites such as the ovaries  heart  and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors. Despite the global prevalence of NETs increasing each year  it is considered a rare cancer that is estimated to affect approximately 35/100 000 individuals worldwide. In the United States  around 12 000 patients annually are expected to be diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors  with an average five-year survival rate of 60% at a metastatic stage.About Orano MedOrano Med is a subsidiary of the Orano Group.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for expedited review the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Tzield (teplizumab-mzwv) to delay the progression of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adults and pediatric patients eight years of age and older recently diagnosed with stage 3 T1D. The FDA nominated Tzield for the Commissioner's National Priority Voucher (CNPV) pilot program based on its potential to address a large unmet medical need. The CNPV program aims to shorten the review process from what normally takes 10-12 months to 1-2 months  while maintaining FDA's rigorous safety and efficacy standards.""We welcome that Tzield has been accepted for expedited review by the FDA under the Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher pilot program  potentially enabling us to go further and faster for patients and lead the way with breakthrough science "" said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines  Sanofi. ""This is a recognition of the breakthrough innovative profile of Tzield  its ability to potentially prevent the natural progression of T1D  and the significant unmet medical need that remains in this area which has seen limited treatment advances in the last 100 years.”The sBLA is supported by the results from the PROTECT phase 3 study  which met its primary endpoint  evaluating preservation of beta cell function as assessed by significantly slowing the decrease in mean C-peptide levels (area under the curve [AUC] after a four-hour mixed meal tolerance test) at trial study completion  compared to placebo. Additionally  the sBLA builds on the clinical development program of Tzield including approximately~1 000 patients.Adverse events observed in the PROTECT phase 3 study were consistent with previous studies. Most common adverse events were headache  nausea  rash  lymphopenia  leukopenia and gastrointestinal symptoms  consistent with the mode of action of cytokine release. 1.8% of those who received Tzield in the PROTECT study developed cytokine release syndrome possibly or probably related to Tzield.Additionally  Tzield is being reviewed under the accelerated approval program  a pathway that allows the FDA to review therapies intended to treat serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need  based on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In line with this requirement  the confirmatory BETA-PRESERVE phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT07088068) was initiated recently and is currently enrolling participants.Tzield is approved in the US  the UK  China  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and pediatric patients eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions around the world. Tzield was previously designated by the FDA as Breakthrough Therapy and was granted orphan drug designation  for investigational medicines that treat rare diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the US.The safety and efficacy of Tzield in stage 3 T1D have not yet been approved by any regulatory authority.About PROTECTPROTECT (clinical study identifier: NCT03875729 ) was a phase 3  randomized  double blind  placebo-controlled  multi-national study. It enrolled 328 children and adolescents (Tzield n=217  placebo n=111) aged eight-17 years diagnosed with clinical  stage 3 T1D in the preceding six weeks; randomization ratio of Tzield to placebo was 2:1. Participants received a first course of 12 daily infusions (of either Tzield or placebo) at randomization  followed by a second course of 12 daily infusions after 26 weeks (approx. six months). All participants received standard-of-care medicines as required.The primary objective of PROTECT was to determine whether Tzield could preserve beta cell function measured by C-peptide  compared to placebo. This was assessed via the trial’s primary endpoint  which measured the difference in mean change of C-peptide level (area under the time-concentration curve [AUC] measured after a four-hour mixed meal tolerance test) from baseline to Week 78 between both groups.Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c  time in range as measured with a CGM  clinically important low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) events and exogenous insulin use. Time in range was defined as: ≥ 70 but ≤180 mg/dL. Clinically relevant hypoglycemic events were defined: level 2 hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL / 3.0 mmol/L) and level 3 hypoglycemia as episodes of severe cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery  even in the absence of a blood glucose reading.Other secondary endpoints were adverse events and overall safety aspects  as well as pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of Tzield. An observational extension study following participants for a further 42 months is ongoing.About TzieldTzield (teplizumab-mzwv) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody. Tzield is the first and only disease modifying therapy in autoimmune T1D; it was approved in the US in November 2022 to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and children eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Today  it is also approved in the UK  China  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait for the same indication. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions around the world.About autoimmune T1DT1D is a progressive autoimmune condition where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin producing beta cells by one’s own immune system. There are four stages to the progression of T1D:In stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range (normoglycemia). At this stage  T1D is presymptomatic.In stage 2 (also presymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells / beta cell function.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will start to experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision  and generalized fatigue. Management of stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.Stage 4 is defined as long-standing autoimmune T1D  often accompanied by evidence of chronic diabetic complications  where little to no beta-cell function remain (it’s been estimated that beta-cell mass is reduced by up to 95%). At this point  the T1D-related autoantibodies might not be present anymore in the blood  as most beta-cells have been rendered useless by the autoimmune attack.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

New data from the ALPHAMEDIX-02 phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05153772) evaluating AlphaMedix (212Pb-DOTAMTATE)  an investigational somatostatin receptor (SSTR) targeted alpha therapy (TAT) using the lead-212 isotope  underscore the first-in-class potential of this investigational medicine for the treatment of patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Detailed results from the phase 2 study  the first to evaluate a TAT across both radioligand therapy (RLT)-naïve and RLT-exposed patients affected by GEP-NETs  were presented in two oral presentations at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress  Berlin  Germany.“Lead-212-based Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) could have a transformative impact across a broad range of solid tumors. With AlphaMedix’s consistent and clinically meaningful responses across both RLT-naïve and RLT-exposed gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) patients  the positive results underscore its potential in this rare and difficult-to-treat cancer ” said Volker Wagner  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer at Orano Med. “These data strongly encourage us to further advance the clinical development of AlphaMedix  and jointly with our partner  Sanofi  make this innovative TAT available to patients in need.”ALPHAMEDIX-02 phase 2 studyALPHAMEDIX-02 is a phase 2  open-label  multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AlphaMedix in patients with unresectable or metastatic SSTR+ GEP-NETs. The study included two cohorts evaluating RLT-naïve and RLT-exposed patients. The primary efficacy endpoint across both cohorts was the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).The study's efficacy endpoints are based on local investigator assessment  per protocol. In addition  a blinded independent central review (BICR) was conducted subsequently. The key efficacy endpoints were met within both the investigator-assessed and BICR results.The following results were presented:RLT-Naïve(n=35)Investigator assessmentIndependent assessment (BICR) *DOR is determined only for participants who have achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1**Defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR or PR or SD per RECIST 1.1***OS assessment is independent of RECIST 1.1 criteria  so BICR is n/a ORR 60.0%(95% CI: 42.1-76.1) 57.1%(95% CI: 39.4-73.7) Duration of Response (DoR) per Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate (95% CI)* 71.9% for ≥ 24 months(95% CI: 44.6-87.4) 81.7% for ≥ 24 months(95% CI: 53.1-93.8) Complete Response (CR) - 2.9% Partial Response (PR) 60.0% 54.3% Stable Disease (SD) 34.3% 28.6% Disease control rate (DCR)** 94.3%(95% CI: 80.8-99.3) 85.7%(95% CI: 69.7-95.2) PFS 36-month PFS rate of 72.3%(95% CI: 53.3-84.5) 36-month PFS rate of 63.3%(95% CI: 40.3-79.4) OS 36-month OS rate of 88.2%(95% CI: 71.5-95.4) Not applicable***RLT-Exposed(n=26)Investigator assessmentIndependent assessment (BICR) *DOR is determined only for participants who have achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1**Defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR or PR or SD per RECIST 1.1***OS assessment is independent of RECIST 1.1 criteria  so BICR is n/a ORR 34.6%(95% CI: 17.2-55.7) 19.2%(95% CI: 6.6-39.4) Duration of Response (DoR) per Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate (95% CI)* 100% for ≥ 18 months(95% CI: 100-100) 100% for ≥ 18 months(95% CI: 100-100) Partial Response (PR) 34.6% 19.2% Stable Disease (SD) 61.5% 80.8% Disease control rate (DCR)** 96.2%(95% CI: 80.4-99.9) 100%(95% CI: 86.8-100) PFS 18-month PFS rate of 82.6%(95% CI: 59.0-93.3) 18-month PFS rate of 88%(95% CI: 67.3-96.0) OS 18-month OS rate of 85.1%(95% CI: 58.5-95.2) Not applicable***AlphaMedix™ had a similar safety profile across both cohorts. Within the RLT-naïve cohort  85.7% of patients received all four doses of AlphaMedix  and 84.6% of patients within the RLT-exposed cohort. All GEP-NET patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 42.3% of RLT-exposed patients and 54.3% of RLT-naïve patients. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs in both groups was lymphocyte count decrease (25.7% of RLT-naïve patients and 15.4% of RLT-exposed patients).“The future of oncology research will be driven by cutting-edge science and next-generation modalities  such as radioligand therapies. AlphaMedix  a promising targeted alpha therapy  embodies the type of solution Sanofi is working to advance ” said Christopher Corsico  MD  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “We are excited to share these robust scientific findings at ESMO as the data could represent a significant advancement in how we treat gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. As we engage with health authorities and advance the clinical program  we remain focused on bringing this innovative modality to patients who need new treatment options”Advancing AlphaMedix in GEP-NETsRLTs  which work by delivering radiation directly to tumor cells  represent an emerging area of oncology research. While current approved beta-emitting RLTs have improved outcomes in patients with GEP-NETs  there remains a critical gap in care  including in those who have progressed following previous RLT.TAT represents an innovative modality in RLT  harnessing high-energy  short-range alpha emissions to precisely target cancer cells while reducing potential exposure to surrounding tissue.""The results observed in the ALPHAMEDIX-02 trial clearly demonstrate exceptional levels of efficacy for a Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT)  based on current available therapies  in both radioligand therapy (RLT)-naïve and RLT-exposed populations and could potentially set new expectations when treating gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) patients with RLTs” said Ebrahim Delpassand  MD  Founder and Chairman  CEO of RadioMedix. “For too long  this patient population has experienced inadequate disease control with current approved therapies. This important work provides hope for a new treatment for GEP-NET patients  their caregivers  and their healthcare providers.”In February 2024  AlphaMedix™ was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the US Food and Drug Administration in RLT-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic GEP-NETs  recognizing the potential clinical benefits of lead-212–based TATs. The ALPHAMEDIX-02 results will form the basis for further discussions with health authorities.An international phase 3 study to further evaluate AlphaMedix in GEP-NETs is actively being planned. AlphaMedix is an investigational medicine and has not been approved by any regulatory authority.In September 2024  Sanofi entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to globally commercialize AlphaMedix.About the ALPHAMEDIX-02 studyALPHAMEDIX-02 is a phase 2  open-label  multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AlphaMedix (212Pb-DOTAMTATE) in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic GEP-NETs  positive somatostatin analogue imaging and at least one site of measurable disease. The study included two cohorts evaluating RLT-naïve (n=35) and RLT-exposed (n=26) GEP-NET patients. RLT-exposed patients had progressive disease after receiving up to four doses of 177Lu-DOTATATE and received their last dose at least six months prior to Day 1. In both cohorts  AlphaMedix was administered at 67.6 μCi/kg every eight weeks for up to four cycles (6 mCi maximum per cycle). The primary efficacy endpoint across both cohorts was ORR per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS and OS.About NETsNETs are a heterogeneous group of cancers that originate from neuroendocrine cells. These cancers occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas but can also occur in other tissues including the thymus  lung  and other uncommon sites such as the ovaries  heart  and prostate. Most NETs strongly express somatostatin receptors. Despite the global prevalence of NETs increasing each year  it is considered a rare cancer that is estimated to affect approximately 35/100 000 individuals worldwide. In the United States  around 12 000 patients annually are expected to be diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors  with an average five-year survival rate of 60% at a metastatic stage.About Orano MedOrano Med is a subsidiary of the Orano Group.

We continued to execute on our strategy and transformation plan. Business fundamentals are being restored. Our cost base is under control with further restructuring and savings achieved over the summer. We are resetting our growth engine and maintaining strict pricing discipline. Early signs of commercial recovery are already visible despite a soft market environment. The leadership team has been further strengthened with the appointment of high-caliber experts to successfully drive the turnaround. We are on track to achieve our full year profitability and cash generation targets with another quarter of limited cash consumption.We are paving the way for the 2026 relaunch when we expect to resume organic growth and positive cash flow generation. Our priority is very clear: building solid foundations to drive future growth. I would like to thank the teams for their relentless efforts. Together  we’re building the new Atos Group.”Operational PerformanceGroup revenue reached €1 977 million in Q3 2025  reflecting a -10.5% organic decline compared to Q3 2024  driven by 2024 contract losses and voluntary contract exits  especially in the Atos Strategic Business Unit (SBU) in the United States and the United Kingdom  as well as overall weak market environment.The Atos SBU generated revenue of €1 621 million  down -19.3% organically compared to Q3 2024.The Eviden SBU revenue was up +77.1% compared to Q3 2024  to €356 million in Q3 2025.Disclosure in this section represents the revised reporting structure of Atos Group  following the implementation of the new organization in the first half 2025 reporting period.

This performance was mainly driven by significant ramp-down  notably in value added resale contracts with low profitability profile  and accelerated insourcing at large clients  partially offset by cross-selling initiatives and the acquisition of new logos.Atos – North America revenue totaled €299 million in Q3 2025  an organic decline of -28.8% compared to Q3 2024. This decrease was mostly driven by 2024 contract exits and a net scope reduction at existing clients. The business is not yet benefiting from improving commercial momentum  although signs of recovery are visible with growing order entry year-on-year.Atos – France revenue reached €264 million in Q3 2025  down -11.6% organically from Q3 2024. The performance was notably impacted by the effectiveness of 2024 contract termination and some unexpected scope reduction in the public sector in the latter part of the quarter  driven by political uncertainty. This was partially offset by cross-selling activity.Atos – UK & Ireland revenue reached €243 million in Q3 2025  down -30.5% organically year-on-year. This performance was largely driven by voluntary contract exits including BPO Business Process Outsourcing activities  especially the conclusion of the DWP PIP healthcare contract.Atos – International Markets revenue was down -20% organically in Q3 2025  to €251 million. This decline was mainly driven by high comparables in 2024  notably linked to Paris Olympics 2024-related activities  as well as contract ramp downs in APAC and Switzerland.Atos – BNN (Belux  Netherlands & Nordics) revenue stood at €202 million in Q3 2025  down -1% organically compared to Q3 2024. This performance reflected expected contract ramp downs and was partially mitigated by strong upsell and cross-selling opportunities  notably with public sector.Eviden revenue was €356 million in Q3 2025  up +77.1% organically compared to Q3 2024.
