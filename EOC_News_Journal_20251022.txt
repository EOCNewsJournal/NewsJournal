They have already tapped into the revenues generated by the assets to bankroll Kiev. The Russian authorities have described those steps as “theft” and vowed retaliation.A statement by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  along with the leaders of Germany  France  several other EU nations plus the UK  which was posted on the EC’s website on Tuesday  insisted that “the full value” of the frozen Russian money should be employed to make sure that “Ukraine has the resources it needs.”Western leaders are planning to hold several meetings this week to discuss “how to take this work forward ” it read.Bloomberg reported on Monday that the US will not be joining the EU-led effort to confiscate the Russian assets. According to the agency’s sources  American officials told their Western European colleagues last week that the move could jeopardize the stability of the international markets.In recent weeks  the EU nations have been mulling the possibility of providing a “reparations loan” of up to €140 billion ($163 billion) to Kiev  using Russian assets as collateral to back the bonds issued by the bloc.While backed by such countries as Germany and France  the proposal faced opposition from Belgium  where Euroclear is based. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever insisted that the liability for the proposed move be shared among all of the bloc’s members  not born by his country alone.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that “smarter” governments oppose the seizure of Russian assets as “they understand that it would fundamentally undermine all principles of international economic activity and  without a doubt  cause enormous harm to the... international financial system.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['UK ‘developing measures', 'Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'several other EU nations', 'Western European backers', 'Western European colleagues', 'international economic activity', 'international financial system', 'frozen Russian money', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European allies', 'several meetings', 'international markets', 'Russian authorities', 'Western leaders', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse', 'developing measures', 'full value', 'EU-led effort', 'American officials', 'recent weeks', 'reparations loan', 'smarter” governments', 'enormous harm', 'The US', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'Kiev', 'statement', 'escalation', 'February', 'revenues', 'steps', 'retaliation', 'Germany', 'France', 'website', 'Tuesday', 'resources', 'work', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'agency', 'move', 'stability', 'possibility', 'collateral', 'bonds', 'bloc', 'countries', 'proposal', 'opposition', 'Belgium', 'liability', 'members', 'country', 'seizure', 'principles', 'doubt']",2025-10-21,2025-10-22,rt.com

Meanwhile  the ECO business delivered continued growth of 3% year-to-date.Alexander Masharov  CEO  commented: “We are pleased to have achieved a relatively stable result for Q3  and our disciplined cost control  continued focus on positive cash flow generation and diversification across business segments is helping us maintain profitability levels. Our focus remains on executing the transformation roadmap toward profitable and sustainable growth  but market conditions remain challenging with persistent volatility due to trade disruptions which continue to flare-up around the world.

The intention to wind down follows a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives  including a potential divestiture.The plan would enable the Company to enhance operational efficiencies and focus on utilizing its available cash to execute its strategy of building a pipeline of novel therapeutics through strategic business development transactions under the leadership of its new management team.“We have undertaken a thorough strategic review and sale process to identify potential buyers or investors with the expertise and resources to take the cell therapy business forward ” said Henry Gosebruch  Chief Executive Officer of Galapagos. “Following a limited number of non-binding offers  ultimately no viable proposals were received with terms or financing that would reasonably support the business’ future. After a comprehensive review of all strategic alternatives  given the ongoing investment requirements  coupled with evolving market dynamics and taking into account the interest of all relevant stakeholders  we believe that allocating our capital to other areas of unmet need would be a more attractive use of our resources. Now that this comprehensive strategic review process has concluded  we look forward to continuing to pursue transformative business development opportunities.”Based on this assessment and extensive input from its advisors  Galapagos intends to wind down its cell therapy business. This intention to wind down the cell therapy business aims to support a stronger and more sustainable future for Galapagos. We are deeply grateful to our dedicated employees  investigators  patients  shareholders  and partners for their continued commitment and support.The intention to wind down the cell therapy business was unanimously approved by the Board of Galapagos NV other than the two Directors appointed by Gilead  both of whom recused themselves from the vote. This intention is subject to the conclusion of consultations with works councils in Belgium and the Netherlands  during which Galapagos will continue to operate the business. Galapagos would consider any viable proposal to acquire all  or part of the cell therapy business  if such a proposal emerges during the wind down process.The intention to wind down  if ultimately implemented  is anticipated to impact approximately 365 employees across Europe  the U.S. and China  as well as the closure of the sites in Leiden (the Netherlands)  Basel (Switzerland)  Princeton and Pittsburgh (U.S.)  and Shanghai (China). The remaining Galapagos NV organization would be repositioned for long-term growth through transformational business development  and would keep a dedicated presence at its headquarters in Mechelen  Belgium. The non-cell therapy activities would continue to be managed by Galapagos.In the event that the board would effectively proceed with a full wind down decision (i.e. when the intention would be confirmed after works council procedures)  the Company would expect to incur the following spend related to the cell therapy business: €100 million to €125 million of operating costs from Q4 2025 through 2026 and €150 million to €200 million of one-time restructuring costs in 2026. An updated 2025 cash outlook will be provided with the Company’s third-quarter earnings in early November.In connection with this process  Paul Weiss  Linklaters and Rutgers & Posch are serving as legal advisors and Morgan Stanley & Co.

Thus  we can narrow 2025 outlook.The external review of merchant portfolio and assessment of our control risk framework have been finalised. We are now focusing on delivering the plan to ensure consistent enforcement  further automation and ongoing commitment to compliance with rules and our defined risk appetite.We have made significant progress on our pruning strategy  with the announcement of an agreement on our North American Business.

Germany revenue hindered by lower terminal sales and a poor performance in acceptance.In terms of products  the Group has made good progress on the delivery of next-generation hardware and associated software  enabling stabilisation of clients churn. The Group has also accelerated the ramp-up of its SoftPOS solution across Europe  confirming the relevance of its solution across segments.In the third quarter  Worldline confirmed its traction in the travel and hospitality verticals. The Group signed two new strategic partnerships  one with Yeepay to unlock cross-border payment opportunities in China’s aviation and travel sector and the other with Outpayce from the Amadeus marketplace  to create a connected ecosystem that drives efficiency  enhances customer experience  and unlocks new revenue opportunities for airlines and travel providers.New wins in the quarter include hotel groups Hesperia and Budapest Quality Apartments (e-commerce acquiring)  while Worldline also expanded its business with a number of existing customers (Lufthansa Group  Millennium Hotels  Minor Hotels  Avis Budget Group  Emirates).Beyond these verticals  Worldline also expanded its activity for fragrance manufacturer and retailer Arabian Oud  unifying payments Europe-wide with acquiring and acceptance.Financial ServicesQ3 2025 revenue reached €201 million  declining 4.5% vs Q3 2024. The performance by division was the following:Card Issuing and Acquiring Processing: Slight decrease linked to reduced volumes notably in Benelux and Italy  partly offset by a good dynamic in Germany with a new client onboarded and pricing and volume uplifts with various customers.Digital Banking: Flat revenue as higher demand in Sanctions Securities Monitoring Services was offset by lower volumes in SMS messaging platforms activities in France and lower iDeal volumes in the Netherlands.Account Payments: Declining revenue in Germany due to lower transformation projects as a result of delivery achievements  not offset by the slight increase in France and the Netherlands.In Q3  Worldline won a contract with Garanti Bank to plug in merchants for e-commerce acquiring services  as well as contracts with large banks in Italy and the Netherlands for payee verification  Wero processing and client migration to the target issuing platform.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was up 0.6% vs Q3 2024 to €85 million. The performance by division was the following:Transport & Mobility: Significant revenue increase mainly driven by strong activity in the UK in the rail industry. Solid performance also in France thanks to ticketing activity and a new Mobility as a Service project with Pays de la Loire. Omnichannel interactions: Slightly lower activity driven by the non-repeat of licence revenue in France  partially offset by increased project activity and volume ramp-up with LCL. Trusted Services: Decline linked to lower activity in France  driven in particular by the end of the Dossier Médical Partagé contract and decreasing volumes on our connected vehicle solution.In Q3  Worldline was selected by the French Services and Payment Agency for the management  coordination and functional design of the legacy ISIS project  the new SIGC (Integrated Management and Control System) and the new 3STR (Real-Time Surface Monitoring System) to serve the French state and French farmers for the payment of agricultural aids.Worldline also renewed its contract with The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) in the UK for several years. As part of this contract  Worldline will modernise and transform its service offering by migrating the solutions to a Google cloud-based service and replacing the existing ticketing software. This will enable the industry to move from a system that uses data that is renewed twice a year to using data that is refreshed in real time  improving the accuracy of monies moved and providing better information for train planners.Tightening of the Group operating model to drive transformation and performance improvementIn order to streamline the organisation we are simplifying Merchant Services. The Go-to Market teams will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer while customer and risk operations will be managed as part of Group Technology and Operations.Refocus on core activities is in-motionOn July 29  2025  the Group announced the contemplated strategic divestment of its Mobility & e-Transactional Services business line and other selected activities within Financial Services to Magellan Partners Group for an upfront enterprise value of €400 million plus an additional contingent consideration of €10 million based on the 2025 operating performance of the perimeter.The process is progressing as expected with the share purchase agreement expected in the coming weeks  and the transaction expected to be closed H1 2026.On October 21  2025  the Group announces it has entered into exclusive negotiations with Shift4 regarding the contemplated divestment of Worldline North American activities for an Enterprise Value of €70 million. Worldline North America perimeter represents a turnover of c.€60 million in 2024. The contemplated transaction is expected to close in the first quarter 2026  subject to usual customary approvals. 1External reviews on Merchants activity in line with expectationsOn July 2  2025  the Group announced that   Accuracy was engaged to review the remaining Group’s High Brand Risk (HBR) portfolio and Oliver Wyman was engaged to conduct an external assessment of the compliance and risk framework and its implementation. Both have been working jointly with the external legal counsel retained by the Group.Accuracy reviewAccuracy performed a review of the Group’s High Brand Risk (HBR) portfolio. As part of a broader risk assessment  Accuracy has also considered the Group’s full Acquiring and Collecting portfolio to assess whether any of the Group’s merchants that are not already classified as HBR exhibit comparable risk characteristics. Accuracy followed a statistical approach and a subsequent line-by-line assessment on the potentially high-risk merchants. On the basis of this review  Worldline can confirm that no material offboarding is expected in the Group’s merchant Acquiring and Collecting portfolio beyond the ones already offboarded since 2023. Additionally  the Group also continues the review of its peripherical technical orchestration layer activity with no material impact in 2025.Oliver Wyman reviewOliver Wyman has presented to Worldline its forward-looking evaluation of the Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) and related risk frameworks and their implementation across the Group. Their review combined peer benchmarking with an assessment of operational effectiveness to identify targeted forward-looking enhancements across FCC and related risk frameworks  operating model and governance  risk assessment  reporting  and coordination between Group and entities. The report confirms that Worldline has made significant effort and considerable progress in enhancing its risk and compliance framework over the last two years  with a clearly defined comprehensive multi-year strategy across the Group. The evaluation also concludes that the FCC framework and governance structures are well defined compared to peers. However  operationalisation within the entities remains uneven and still faces implementation challenges  largely due to the organisation’s rapid growth through acquisition. It also reflects the opportunity to further leverage automation  technology and centralisation in Global Capability Centres  to drive process industrialisation. Worldline is updating the plan accordingly and commits to a swift execution.In parallel  Worldline is fully cooperating with the regulators and schemes  responding promptly to their questions and ongoing audits.Worldline to outline its strategy at the Capital Markets Day on November 6thThe Group will host its Capital Markets Day in Paris on November 6  2025. At the event  senior management will outline the Company’s mid-term ambition and explain how Worldline’s unique positioning can drive long-term value for shareholders and partners.2025 Outlook range narrowedFor 2025  Worldline expects a low single digit percentage organic decline in Group External revenue  with an improvement in H2 compared with H1  thanks notably to the tapering off of one-off items. Management maintains its strong focus on cost control and confirms the run-rate €50 million cash costs savings by end-2025.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of €830-855m  impacted by lower revenue and a continued negative client and sector mix.Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of €(30)-0m+  depending on adjusted EBITDA with strict control over capital expenditure and increase in financing costs. Restructuring cash outflow  excluding Power24  is expected to amount to around €150m  including costs driven by the portfolio pruning in progress and workforce optimisation.AppendicesRECONCILIATION OF Q3 2024 STATUTORY REVENUE WITH Q3 2024 REVENUE AT CONSTANT SCOPE AND EXCHANGE RATESFor the analysis of the Group’s performance  Q3 2024 revenue at constant scope and exchange rates as presented below per Global Business Lines:Revenue In € million Q3 2024 Scope effects** Exchange rates effects Q3 2024* Merchant Services 866.7 +4.3 -6.3 864.7 Financial Services 210.7 +0.0 +0.0 210.8 Mobility & e-Transactional Services 85.4 +0.0 -0.3 85.1 Worldline 1 162.8 +4.3 -6.5 1 160.6 * At constant scope and Sept 2025 YTD average exchange rates 0.0 ** At December 2024 YTD average exchange ratesThe exchange rates effect in Q3 is mainly linked to the depreciation of the Australian dollar  Turkish lira and Indian rupee  partly offset by the appreciation of the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona.

Revenue amounted to € 49.6 million  up by +5.7% in current currencies. In constant currencies  revenue growth reached +9.0% (€+4.2 million). Growth mainly came from SaaS & Hosting subscriptions  up by +16.6% in constant currencies (€+3.5 million) and  to a lesser extent  from Perpetual licenses  up +28.3% (€+0.5 million).This level of revenue growth in Q3 2025 was achieved in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment  which impacted customer decision making over the last quarters. In turn  this limited Planisware’s ability to win new logos and  subsequently  to up-sell  in particular with evolutive support services.Loïc Sautour  CEO of Planisware  commented: “In Q3 2025  Planisware revenue growth remained below historical levels  impacted by macro headwinds. First  a challenging and unclear economic and geopolitical environment limiting visibility and driving longer decision-making cycles across our customer base and prospects. Second  IT budgets being under pressure  with spending allocated to AI investments and strong price increases from certain SaaS vendors. Over the last quarters  this has limited our ability to secure new logos and  in turn  to up-sell  particularly in evolutive support services.However  we are beginning to see signs of improvement across all these areas  materializing in a strong level of signings for both new logos and existing clients in the past weeks. Concerns around a potential slowdown and discussion around tariffs are less and less a reason for delaying strategic moves  and our moderated price increase policy position us as a trusted long-term partner for our clients and creates additional replacement opportunities. In parallel  the seriousness of our AI strategy based on true value creation continues to give us a competitive edge.While these commercial successes will have limited effect on the year-end performance  it makes us cautiously optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate commercial momentum and continue delivering value to our customers through our AI-powered SaaS platform.”Q3 2025 revenue by revenue streamIn € million Q3 2025 Q3 2024 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 44.1 41.4 +6.4% +9.8% SaaS & Hosting 23.5 20.8 +13.1% +16.6% Annual licenses 0.1 0.0 N/A N/A Evolutive support 13.0 13.0 +0.3% +3.7% Subscription support 2.8 2.8 -0.8% +4.0% Maintenance 4.7 4.8 -2.9% -0.8% Non-recurring revenue 5.6 5.6 +0.3% +2.6% Perpetual licenses 2.5 2.0 +25.1% +28.3% Implementation & others non-recurring 3.0 3.5 -13.9% -12.1% Total revenue 49.6 47.0 +5.7% +9.0%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at Q3 2024 average exchange rates.Reaching € 49.6 million in Q3 2025  revenue was up by +5.7% in current currencies and +9.0% in constant currencies. The exchange rates effect was mainly related to the depreciation of the US dollar versus the euro. In order to reflect the underlying performance of the Company independently from exchange rate fluctuations  the following analysis refers to revenue evolution in constant currencies  applying Q3 2024 average exchange rates to Q3 2025 revenue figures  unless expressly stated otherwise.Recurring revenueRepresenting 89% of Q3 2025 total revenue  up by c.+70 basis points versus 88% in Q3 2024  recurring revenue reached € 44.1 million  up by +9.8%.Revenue growth was led by +16.6% growth of Planisware’s SaaS & Hosting activities thanks to contracts secured with new customers as well as continued expansion within the installed base. Revenue of support activities (Evolutive & Subscription support)  intrinsically related to Planisware’s SaaS offering  grew by +3.8%.Maintenance revenue was slightly down (-0.8%) in the context of the Group’s shift from its prior Perpetual license model to a SaaS model.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue was up by +2.6% in Q3 2025  helped by Perpetual licenses  up +28.3% with extensions and upgrades sold in Q3 2025 to established customers with specific on-premises needs.The continued effort to deliver shorter implementations and to bring value faster to customers continued to drive down the planned revenue decline in Implementation. At -12.1% in Q3  revenue decline was accelerated by the lack of start of new projects.Commercial dynamicIn Q3 2025  despite sales cycles remaining longer than a year before  Planisware welcomed a significant number of new clients from a wide range of industries and geographies. In Product Development & Innovation  within the manufacturing industry  new wins included Wittenstein and Etex  the latter representing the first significant win of the newly opened Brussels’ office. In life-science  Planisware won new clients such as Regeneron and Ingredion in the USA  and Mindray in the UK. Other notable Q3 wins came from Project Control & Engineering  with Uniper in Germany and Getlink in France  as well as in IT Governance & Digital Transformation with Rabobank in the Netherlands and SP Group in Singapore.Planisware also continued to support its existing customers in adapting to a rapidly changing environment  while maintaining or enhancing their operational efficiency. As a result  key clients such as Lindt & Sprüngli in Germany or Philips in the Netherlands significantly expanded their usage of Planisware’s solutions and support practices. This was also the case with significant cross-sells in the USA with ADM now using Planisware Enterprise for Product Development & Innovation on top of their former usage in IT Governance & Digital Transformation  and Amgen expanding to Project Control & Engineering from the former Product Development & Innovation pilar.2025 objectives confirmedPlanisware confirms all its 2025 objectives as updated on July 31  2025:c. 10% revenue growth in constant currenciesc. 36% adjusted EBITDA margin *c. 80% Cash Conversion Rate*AppendicesInvestors & Analysts conference callPlanisware’s management team will host an international conference call on October 21  2025 at 8:00am CET to detail Q3 2025 performance and key achievements  by means of a presentation followed by a Q&A session.

The topic of the day is yesterday’s amendment regarding the guarding of the Monument of the Unknown Soldier  which is to be discussed in Parliament. I imagine that  apart from Mitsotakis himself  who will defend the new provision — meant to bring some order to the “campground” at the monument — Floridis will also speak.As for the substance of the provision  I think we’ve said enough already: if you can find a place  a country  where the local Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is not guarded by the military  do let the Opposition know.But moving on — there should be no doubt that something perfectly normal everywhere else in the world will  here  spark backlash  noise  and likely “multi-speed” episodes from the opposition — ranging from the KKE  the far left  and the “conspiracy crowd ” all the way to the classic rioters with Molotov cocktails. I’m not including Karystianou in that description  since I’ve seen no acts of violence from her or her followers.The Filises and the SkourletisesIt’s interesting to hear the view of an old  very experienced politician still in office:“Look  these are not easy times… for the Left.” An entire generation has “retired” — the Filises  the Voutsises  the Skourletises — all done  and what’s more  even Tsipras doesn’t want to see them anymore. You see  these people had only two things to do: protests for Palestine (168 marches — bless them) and Tempi. Now that the Palestine issue has run its course — what’s left? The chaos in Syntagma.And the government…Starting tomorrow  the law will be in force banning tents in Syntagma — next to or on top of the Unknown Soldier — so  as the saying goes  “no sooner said than done.” Chrysochoidis has drawn up a plan to protect the monument  without any intent to provoke  though the others will be itching for it. Still  since the government announced and passed it — truth be told  six years late — it has to enforce it  because if it doesn’t  things will only get worse.All together on the amendmentLet me inform you that the big internal debate within the government yesterday was about who would table the amendment on the Unknown Soldier. In the end  they went with a “let’s all go together” model — so it was submitted jointly by several ministries: primarily Defense (responsible for the site)  Justice (responsible for penalties)  and Citizen Protection (responsible for the actual guarding). Usually  an amendment is simply presented by the lead ministry — in this case  theoretically Defense — maybe together with Finance for budgetary impact. But as you can see  this one required some careful handling. Or rather  they need to handle it carefully — since they’re all a bit faint-hearted.Adonis–DendiasAlso worth noting: the intra-party “match” between Adonis and Dendias has restarted — despite the cheerful photo-ops at the Cabinet meeting and the recent book launch of Stylianides  where they sat side by side. Adonis’s response yesterday on Action24 — “Ask Dendias  he’ll tell you about the Unknown Soldier” — reflects the Health Minister’s view that Dendias will soon have to get his hands dirty and do something politically costly  instead of making popular moves aimed at the broad audience. Personally  I think he’ll do nothing and leave it all to Chrysochoidis.The Mitsotakis interviewIn this environment  I’m told that K.M. wants to be out front  letting nothing slip by. That’s why  in addition to today’s appearance in Parliament to defend the amendment about the Unknown Soldier  he’s expected to give a radio interview on SKAI tomorrow morning (Portosalte) before heading to Brussels for the EU Summit.Poll – We told you so…Yesterday I read the Marc poll (Antenna). On the government front  nothing new — ND hovers around 30% after adjustments  with inflation remaining the top concern. But on the center-left  the (now official) reappearance of Tsipras has almost immediately flattened our dear Nikos. You might say  “flattened the already flattened ” but still — when the question “Who best represents the center-left?” gets you folded in half by Tsipras (24% versus 12.6%) and you’re tied with little Zoe — well  you’ve got a problem.Thessalian derby: Koureta vs. TsiarasNow let’s move on to another kind of derby — a more pastoral one this time. The regional governor of Thessaly  Koureta  called a press conference yesterday to announce that  following recent meetings in Brussels  there’s a vaccine for smallpox and doses are also planned for Greece — with vaccination responsibility falling to the regional authorities. He even took a swipe at the Ministry of Rural Development  implying they knew and kept quiet. Now  why he needed a trip to Brussels instead of simply asking the relevant authorities back home  Koureta didn’t say. But I get the sense that  with parades coming up and given the beating politicians have been taking from farmers and ranchers  he decided yesterday to play the good guy — even if it meant throwing Tsiaras and others under the bus. The Ministry  caught off guard  quickly started circulating a statement from the relevant department of the University of Thessaly  declaring the existing vaccines unsuitable and citing experts who say vaccination is an extreme  desperate measure. A similar sentiment came from Bulgaria — in the same boat — where Commissioner Hansen sounded the alarm about the export credibility of meat and dairy products.The Ministry of Tourism properties on Amalias Avenue go to Alpha BankAs we approach the end of the year  we should expect more moves and deals in the domestic real estate market  with banks also looking into selective placements—particularly in income-generating properties with reliable tenants in so-called prime locations. To that end  Alpha Real Estate Services CEO Ioannis Ganos confirmed last week  speaking at a conference about Alpha Bank’s strategy  that the bank is indeed focusing on “investments in stable-income  core real estate.” As he said  the bank has an investment plan worth €1 billion  of which €500 million has already been implemented (see: Skyline  Ermou properties  etc.). According to reports  Alpha Bank has purchased from Prodea Investments REIC two buildings that house the Ministry of Tourism’s offices on Amalias Avenue. These highly prominent  prime properties—now under Alpha Bank’s control—had been part of Prodea’s portfolio slated for sale to AKTOR  a deal that ultimately fell through.What Bouzna’s lips didn’t say…It’s not just what Euronext CEO Stéphane Bouzna said yesterday at Aegli  but what could be read between the lines. First off  the man’s a professional—executing the full “package” required by his public offer for the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX). His presentation was polished and on point: he highlighted all the right features (increased liquidity for ATHEX  cybersecurity investments  after-hours trading  etc.)  while promising to attract companies from the Balkans and establish a technology and support hub in Athens. Throughout the presentation  he was polite  friendly  smiling often—even reminisced about the ancient Greek he’d learned as a teenager.But the moment that revealed what he’s really made of came when he talked about the offer price. Though his audience was journalists—supposedly neutral observers—he twice urged them to “read his lips” before firmly stating he had no intention of changing the price  which he described as “very attractive ” valuing ATHEX at 22 times its 2024 earnings. The message was clear: “That’s the deal—take it or leave it.”ATHEX: The most expensive stock exchange in EuropeThe only moment of visible unease during the press conference came when Bouzna was asked about potential changes to the public offer regime  given that this is a cross-border transaction. If he gets the chance  Bouzna will merge ATHEX—and though he didn’t say so outright  it was clear that many things will change once he takes control. Dark Room’s prediction: Giorgos Kontopoulos will remain until his contract expires and then depart; meanwhile  Bouzna and Kontopoulos will privately admit that cooperation was difficult. As for ATHEX employees—it might be wise to start reconnecting with headhunters. Bouzna also dropped several zingers supporting his strategic narrative for ATHEX—remarks implying that the current management should feel  if not outright failed  at least embarrassed. He pointed out that the Athens Stock Exchange is the most expensive in Europe—2% higher than all others. Another killer line: “The Oslo Stock Exchange has more shipping companies than ATHEX.”Prokopiou’s Dynagas caught in the sanctions crossfireGreek shipowner George Prokopiou  head of the New York–listed Dynagas  is once again at the center of international financial chatter—this time because three of the company’s LNG carriers have been included in the UK’s new sanctions list targeting Russian energy firms. From an economic standpoint  the move “makes absolutely no sense ” said the Greek owner  noting that the vessels are not Russian-owned  their cargoes and charterers have no sanctions link  and they exclusively serve Yamal Trade  a subsidiary of Russia’s Yamal Arctic  delivering LNG to European markets.The Korean Intralot investor’s pharaonic project in Las VegasAfter closing the deal involving Intralot—which  together with Bally’s International Interactive  now forms a €2 billion market-cap group active in lotteries and online gaming—Soo Kim  the major shareholder of both the Greek firm (now holding 57.8%) and the American Bally’s group  is already pursuing his next mega-investment. It’s a pharaonic $3 billion project: the creation of Bally’s Las Vegas  a landmark integrated resort and casino complex on the Las Vegas Strip. The plan  recently announced  envisions construction on a 350-acre site formerly occupied by Tropicana Las Vegas  alongside a new 33 000-seat stadium for the Las Vegas Athletics baseball team. The resort will include two hotel towers totaling around 3 000 rooms  a theater  shopping and dining venues  entertainment spaces  and more. Development is expected to begin in the first half of 2026 and be completed by March 2029. At the same time  Bally’s is also competing for one of the new casino licenses to be issued in New York  proposing an integrated resort-casino in the Bronx—on the site of the former Trump Organization golf course. The project has received initial approval from the local Community Advisory Committee  though it still faces opposition from neighborhood groups and residents.The Papastavrou–Tsafos duo and the Energy Council backroom sceneBehind closed doors at the EU Energy Ministers’ Council on October 20  Greece—represented by the Papastavrou–Tsafos duo—joined Bulgaria  Slovakia  Slovenia  and Hungary in submitting a joint proposal to simplify EU methane-emission regulations. According to diplomatic sources  the move “speaks Washington’s language.” For weeks  the U.S. has been quietly pressuring Brussels to ease the new rules  which could raise the cost of American LNG and hurt its competitiveness in the European market. Washington views the upcoming EU regulation—requiring third countries  starting in 2027  to meet strict methane-measurement and reduction standards—as an obstacle for U.S. LNG exports. More monitoring means higher costs—and the U.S. doesn’t want to lose the advantage it gained in Europe after Russia’s exit. Greece  without saying so openly  is fully aligned with this reasoning  arguing for a “realistic transition” and the need to safeguard supply security.
