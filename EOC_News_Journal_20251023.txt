The move would effectively amount to the seizure of the Russian funds  given that Ukraine would be obliged to repay the loan only once Moscow compensates it for damages inflicted during the conflict.El Pais warned in an article on Tuesday that “Ukraine has serious financial problems.” According to EU sources cited by the outlet  Kiev currently only has enough money to stay afloat “until the end of the first quarter of 2026.”The paper said that the leaders of EU nations are expected to support the loan to Ukraine during their meeting in Brussels on Thursday.So far  Belgium  which hosts clearinghouse Euroclear  where most of Moscow’s frozen funds are being kept  has been skeptical of the loan proposal and has demanded that liability be shared among all EU members if the move is made.On Wednesday  the Ukrainian parliament voted in favor of the country’s draft budget for 2026  which has a deficit of over 58%. It projects that the Kiev government will spend 4.8 trillion hryvnia (around $114 billion) next year  while earning just 2.8 trillion hryvnia (around $68 billion). According to the draft  the 2.8 trillion hryvnia in tax revenue will be used to fund the military  with all other state expenditure to be covered by financial aid from foreign backers.The US and EU blocked an estimated $300 billion in Russian assets after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022  some €200 billion ($213 billion) of which is held by Euroclear. They have already tapped into the revenues generated by Moscow funds to provide assistance to Kiev. The Russian authorities have described the steps as “theft” and has vowed retaliation.,neutral,0.01,0.69,0.31,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['El Pais', 'Kiev', 'money', 'April', 'other state expenditure', 'serious financial problems', 'frozen Russian assets', 'financial aid', 'Russian authorities', 'Ukrainian government', 'Spanish newspaper', 'El Pais', 'recent weeks', 'bloc-issued bonds', 'first quarter', 'Ukrainian parliament', '4.8 trillion hryvnia', '2.8 trillion hryvnia', 'tax revenue', 'foreign backers', 'The US', 'Russian funds', 'enough funds', 'The EU', 'EU sources', 'EU nations', 'EU members', 'enough money', 'clearinghouse Euroclear', 'draft budget', 'reparations loan', 'loan proposal', 'Kiev government', 'Moscow funds', 'Ukraine conflict', '€140 billion', '63 billion', 'April', 'collateral', 'move', 'seizure', 'damages', 'article', 'Tuesday', 'outlet', 'leaders', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'Belgium', 'liability', 'Wednesday', 'favor', 'country', 'deficit', 'military', 'escalation', 'February', 'revenues', 'assistance', 'steps', 'retaliation']",2025-10-22,2025-10-23,rt.com

Fortunately  having raked in tens of billions of dollars from the fallout of Russ…,As the European Union tries to put together a large loan for Ukraine  sovereign guarantees and the risk they pose to member states' credit ratings have become a stumbling block. Fortunately  having raked in tens of billions of dollars from the fallout of Russia's invasion  Norway could break the impasse.EDINBURGH/OSLO – While credit ratings are not commonly seen as a determining factor in war  that may have changed with Ukraine’s struggle for survival against Russia’s invading army. As the European Union works toward a mechanism to leverage frozen Russian sovereign assets for Ukraine’s defense  the implied risks to some member countries’ credit ratings have become a sticking point. But there is a simple way to get around the impasse.The EU’s plan is to extend Ukraine an interest-free €140 billion ($163 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian assets held by the Belgian central securities depository  Euroclear. But the scheme needs additional backing by sovereign guarantees  and therein lies the problem. For highly indebted EU member countries  including France  taking on additional contingent liabilities could pose a risk to sovereign credit ratings  with potentially costly implications for debt servicing.A loan for Ukraine thus hangs on reassuring member states that ratings agencies won’t view their guarantees as accruing to their debts. The European Commission has responded to such concerns by structuring the guarantees as off-balance-sheet liabilities unless triggered  and has enhanced collective EU responsibility. But this has not assuaged Belgium’s doubts as the holder of the Russian funds  and it may have introduced additional concerns as well.Fearing potential Russian lawsuits or claims against it in the future  the Belgian government insists on legally binding  EU-wide indemnity to cover the legal and financial risks associated with the loan  and to guarantee its full amount. But solidifying EU countries’ national guarantees risks reversing some of the credit-rating assurances that France and others secured. This is no small matter  because a ratings downgrade would not only have a serious impact on their borrowing costs  but also could affect their ability to rearm as a part of Europe’s joint defense build-up.Ensuring that the envisioned loan to Ukraine does not impinge on the continent’s aggregate debt burden therefore is in everyone’s interest. To that end  Norway  while not an EU member  could play a decisive role. It boasts the most solid AAA bond rating in Europe – and arguably anywhere – owing to its $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund and robust institutions. It could singlehandedly take on the contingent liability associated with fresh Ukrainian debt  and without a dent to its credit rating. In doing so  Norway’s government would both strengthen Ukraine’s defenses against a revanchist aggressor and reduce financial risks to its European allies’ rearmament efforts.Although Norway’s government already contributes financially to Ukraine’s war effort  it has resisted calls to donate the €109 billion that it generated in excess natural-gas profits in 2022 and 2023. Yet these windfalls were a direct consequence of the spike in energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. By hoarding these profits  Norway’s government turned the country into a war profiteer.Fall Sale: Save 40% on a PS new subscription PS_Sales_FallSale2025 Fall Sale: Save 40% on a PS new subscription For a limited time  you can gain greater access to Project Syndicate – including every new PS commentary  our entire suite of subscriber-exclusive content  the full PS archive  and more – starting at just $49.99 for your first year. SUBSCRIBE NOWIt has done so  apparently  because it fears setting a dangerous precedent for withdrawals from its sovereign wealth fund. But guaranteeing the EU’s borrowing scheme for Ukraine requires no withdrawal. As any banker knows  guarantees are never completely costless  but the political costs should be minimal.Before issuing a sovereign guarantee  Norway can insist that the Russian assets remain frozen for the duration of the loan. Repayment of that loan would occur only after Russia has provided compensation to Ukraine for the destruction caused by the war; in the meantime  the Russian assets will remain immobilized in accordance with the European Council’s decision.In the unlikely case that Russia were to provide Ukraine with suitable compensation  thereby potentially unlocking the Russian assets held by Belgium  the ensuing contingent liability could be set to fall first on the AAA-rated EU itself  with Norway serving as a backstop. Alternatively  Norway could further diminish its status as a war profiteer by assuming the contingent liability directly. And the same would apply in the unlikely event that Russia succeeds in bringing a future legal challenge to retrieve the frozen assets.Norway’s cynical stinginess on Ukraine has damaged its global reputation  not least in the eyes of neighboring Scandinavian countries. While its allocations to Ukraine have increased recently  they remain a fraction of the full amount of its war profits.Jens Stoltenberg  the former NATO secretary-general who became Norway’s finance minister this past February  recently wrote a memoir about his stint leading the alliance at a time when Russia’s invasion was clearly the greatest challenge it had faced since the end of the Cold War. He should recognize that his legacy risks being tarnished by inaction in facilitating Ukraine’s defense and Europe’s rearmament. He and Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre  as well as the Norwegian Parliament  should recognize the sovereign guarantee as  in fact  a sovereign duty that Norway bears toward its allies and fellow European democracies.,neutral,0.18,0.7,0.13,negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['War Profiteering', 'Norway', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian central securities depository', 'solid AAA bond rating', 'European allies’ rearmament efforts', '$2 trillion sovereign wealth fund', 'indebted EU member countries', 'member countries’ credit ratings', ""member states' credit ratings"", 'EU countries’ national guarantees', 'neighboring Scandinavian countries', 'binding, EU-wide indemnity', 'aggregate debt burden', 'fresh Ukrainian debt', 'The European Commission', 'sovereign credit ratings', 'collective EU responsibility', 'potential Russian lawsuits', 'joint defense build-up', 'excess natural-gas profits', 'ensuing contingent liability', 'full PS archive', 'additional contingent liabilities', 'new PS commentary', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'future legal challenge', 'ratings agencies', 'ratings downgrade', 'sovereign guarantee', 'debt servicing', 'European Union', 'European Council', 'balance-sheet liabilities', 'full amount', 'Russian assets', 'additional backing', 'new subscription', 'Russian funds', 'Belgian government', 'frozen assets', 'stumbling block', 'determining factor', 'invading army', 'sticking point', 'simple way', 'costly implications', 'credit-rating assurances', 'small matter', 'serious impact', 'borrowing costs', 'decisive role', 'robust institutions', 'revanchist aggressor', 'direct consequence', 'energy prices', 'Fall Sale', 'limited time', 'greater access', 'Project Syndicate', 'entire suite', 'subscriber-exclusive content', 'first year', 'dangerous precedent', 'political costs', 'unlikely case', 'unlikely event', 'cynical stinginess', 'global reputation', 'additional concerns', 'financial risks', 'interest-free €140 billion', 'war effort', 'war profiteer', 'borrowing scheme', 'suitable compensation', 'large loan', 'Ukraine', 'tens', 'billions', 'dollars', 'fallout', 'invasion', 'Norway', 'impasse', 'EDINBURGH/OSLO', 'struggle', 'survival', 'mechanism', 'plan', 'Euroclear', 'problem', 'France', 'debts', 'Belgium', 'doubts', 'holder', 'claims', 'others', 'part', 'continent', 'everyone', 'end', 'defenses', 'calls', 'windfalls', 'spike', 'country', 'withdrawals', 'banker', 'duration', 'Repayment', 'destruction', 'meantime', 'accordance', 'decision', 'AAA-rated', 'backstop', 'status', 'eyes', 'allocations']",2025-10-22,2025-10-23,project-syndicate.org

Russia has described those steps as “theft” and vowed retaliation.The European Commission has proposed using proceeds from around €210 billion in frozen assets held in the EU to guarantee loans to Ukraine in 2026 and 2027. The plan comes as US military aid declines and EU budgets tighten.“We believe  and we are not the only ones  that it is necessary to respect international rules and the principle of legality ” Meloni said  adding that the bloc must safeguard “the financial and monetary stability of our economies and the euro area.”She said Italian troops would not set foot in Ukraine but said it was necessary to “increase pressure on Moscow.” The Kremlin has made clear it would not accept any foreign military presence in Ukraine as part of a peace settlement.The confiscation of sovereign assets is prohibited under international law  a rule many EU capitals  the European Central Bank  and the International Monetary Bank insist cannot be breached. Belgium has asked for guarantees that it will not be left to deal with Moscow alone if the money ever has to be returned.Moscow has condemned the asset freeze and any attempt to repurpose the funds.

However  the US’s ambivalent and rapidly changing approach to the conflict  including cutting funding for Ukraine  has galvanised attitudes in many capitals.Last month  EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen floated an outline approach to fund a “solidarity loan” for Ukraine.Some Brussels officials say there is an increasing urgency among Ukraine’s more ardent supporters to advance this before a planned summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks.Brussels diplomats hope the process may get a green light from EU leaders  including Taoiseach Micheál Martin  at their quarterly summit in Brussels this week. That would authorise lawyers at the policy-guiding commission to begin the complex task of framing a legal text.Belgium has raised legitimate concerns on the issue because it is the location for Euroclear  the organisation that formally holds the frozen Russian assets.The Belgian government has pointed to the risk of a changing situation  easing or ending sanctions against Moscow  leading to a massive Russian reparations claim.The EU leaders must find ways of getting around an expected veto from Hungarian prime minister Viktor OrbanBut there is an emerging view that this is a most unlikely scenario as anti-Russian sanctions would probably persist right up until all previous Ukrainian territory  including Crimea  which was annexed in 2014  is restored.A longer-term notion  that Kyiv could repay the solidarity loan via Russian war reparations  looks equally unlikely.The EU leaders must also find ways of getting around an expected veto from Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban  who has a long history of blocking Brussels aid to Ukraine. Orban  who will glory in hosting the forthcoming Trump-Putin summit  is not expected to attend tomorrow’s EU gathering.The basic idea that the EU is working on would involve replacing the Russian assets with zero-coupon bonds from the European Commission. These bonds would be backed by guarantees from either all EU countries  or just those willing to participate  assuming a Hungarian veto.Moving the assets away from Euroclear would allow greater investment flexibility and higher returns  off­icials believe  investing the Russian assets long-term and at better interest rates.Putting this complex plan together will be challen­ging for Von der Leyen’s top team  but in all the cir­cumstances there appears to be few other options for the EU leaders striving to make sense of a Putin-Trump world that has so changed the previous order.,neutral,0.01,0.78,0.21,negative,0.01,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Ursula von der Leyen', 'The Irish Independent', 'Ukraine ‘solidarity loan', 'tough task', 'View', 'line', 'Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Taoiseach Micheál Martin', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'massive Russian reparations claim', 'Russian war reparations', 'late Febru\xadary', 'greater investment flexibility', 'previous Ukrainian territory', 'rapidly changing approach', 'Some Brussels officials', 'forthcoming Trump-Putin summit', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU Commission president', 'Hungarian veto', 'outline approach', 'changing situation', 'previous order', 'policy-guiding commission', 'European Commission', 'serious snags', '27 member states', 'many capitals', 'solidarity loan', 'increasing urgency', 'ardent supporters', 'Donald Trump', 'Vladimir Putin', 'coming weeks', 'Brussels diplomats', 'green light', 'quarterly summit', 'complex task', 'legal text', 'legitimate concerns', 'Belgian government', 'emerging view', 'unlikely scenario', 'longer-term notion', 'long history', 'Brussels aid', 'basic idea', 'higher returns', 'off\xadicials', 'interest rates', 'complex plan', 'top team', 'cir\xadcumstances', 'other options', 'Putin-Trump world', 'EU leaders', 'EU gathering', 'EU countries', 'anti-Russian sanctions', 'zero-coupon bonds', 'funding remedy', 'tanks', 'Ukraine', 'source', 'costs', 'Kyiv', 'hatful', 'caution', 'Ireland', 'ambivalent', 'conflict', 'attitudes', 'Budapest', 'process', 'lawyers', 'Belgium', 'issue', 'location', 'Euroclear', 'organisation', 'risk', 'Moscow', 'ways', 'Crimea', 'tomorrow', 'guarantees', 'sense']",2025-10-22,2025-10-23,independent.ie

These funds are crucial not only for military expenditures but al…,"Live Eventsas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channelUkraine is urging European countries not to limit its use of a proposed $163 billion loan based on frozen Russian state assets  arguing that it needs to be able to buy non-European arms  repair war damage from Russian attacks and compensate victims.With EU leaders to discuss the "" Reparations Loan "" to Kyiv on Thursday at talks attended by Ukraine's president  some states suggest the funds be spent mainly on European-made weapons to boost their defence industries as threats from Russia grow.A senior official in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's administration told Reuters Ukraine needed the funds by the end of the year and autonomy over how to spend them  in some of the first public comments laying out Kyiv's stance in detail.""Ukraine's position is that any conditionality undermines the principle of justice. So the victim  not the donors or partners  must determine how to address its most urgent defence  recovery and compensation needs "" Iryna Mudra  a top legal adviser in Zelenskiy's administration  said in an interview.SOME US WEAPONS ARE CENTRAL TO UKRAINE'S DEFENCEU.S.-made Patriot air defence systems have  for instance  been crucial to Ukraine's ability to shoot down Russian ballistic missile salvos that have targeted military sites  power stations and also smashed civilian buildings.In comments that come at a crucial moment in the EU's deliberations  Mudra told Reuters that Ukraine supported cooperation with European defence industries and was already finalising deals with Europe's biggest industrial companies.""But we would insist on autonomy in deciding how to allocate resources between defence - if there (are) not enough defence capacities in European countries  then we have to have the possibility to buy (them) from non-European countries.""She said part of the loan must go towards ""urgent reconstruction needs""  such as Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure which has been pummelled by Russian strikes as well as ""to a prudent extent"" towards compensation for victims.According to a European Commission document seen by Reuters  some European states want the funds to go predominantly on European-made weapons  while others say there must be flexibility.As a compromise  the Commission suggested the majority of the loan should be spent on Ukrainian and European weapons but a smaller part would be for general budget support  which Kyiv could also use to buy arms from outside Europe.SUMMIT MAY PAVE THE WAY FOR FORMAL LEGAL PROPOSALEuropean leaders expressed broad support earlier this month for the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the West to provide a 140 billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine.EU diplomats say many legal and technical challenges need to be addressed  in particular to reassure Belgium  which holds the Russian assets that would be used in its Euroclear securities depository.But senior EU officials say they hope leaders at Thursday's summit will give the green light for further work on the idea  with a view to the Commission producing a formal legal proposal.The Kremlin has described the plan as an illegal seizure of Russian property and cautioned there would be retaliation.Under international law  sovereign assets cannot be confiscated. The proposal would allow EU governments to lend the funds to Ukraine  which would repay them once it receives war reparations from Russia in an eventual peace agreement.Supporting Ukraine has become harder for Europe as it faces fiscal headwinds and has had to carry more of the burden since Trump took over the White House in January  making it clear that new U.S.-funded assistance is not in the offing.Ukraine is yet to find funding to plug an $18 billion gap in its 2026 budget  according to its finance ministry.""We really would like to convince our allies that the EU reparation loan must be operational by the end of 2025 to avoid this financing gap and to ensure continuity of military and macro-financial support "" Mudra said.Failing to do that would mean Ukraine risking entering next year without predictable sources of financing  she added.",neutral,0.0,0.59,0.4,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['EU conditions', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'loan', 'S.-made Patriot air defence systems', 'new U.S.-funded assistance', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'Russian ballistic missile salvos', 'FORMAL LEGAL PROPOSALEuropean leaders', 'Trusted News Source', 'top legal adviser', 'biggest industrial companies', 'critical energy infrastructure', 'Euroclear securities depository', 'eventual peace agreement', 'enough defence capacities', 'SOME US WEAPONS', 'first public comments', 'urgent reconstruction needs', 'Russian state assets', 'senior EU officials', 'European defence industries', 'general budget support', 'President Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'EU reparation loan', 'European Commission document', 'urgent defence', 'many legal', 'Russian assets', 'European weapons', 'EU leaders', 'senior official', 'Russian attacks', 'Russian strikes', 'Russian property', 'broad support', 'macro-financial support', 'European countries', 'European-made weapons', 'sovereign assets', 'EU diplomats', 'EU governments', 'Live Events', 'war damage', 'compensation needs', 'power stations', 'civilian buildings', 'crucial moment', 'prudent extent', '140 billion euro', 'technical challenges', 'green light', 'The Kremlin', 'illegal seizure', 'international law', 'war reparations', 'fiscal headwinds', 'White House', '$18 billion gap', 'finance ministry', 'predictable sources', '$163 billion loan', 'Reparations Loan', '$163 billion) loan', 'European states', 'non-European arms', 'military sites', 'smaller part', 'financing gap', 'next year', 'Iryna Mudra', 'Supporting Ukraine', 'Reuters Ukraine', '2026 budget', 'Reliable', 'Addas', 'victims', 'Kyiv', 'Thursday', 'talks', 'funds', 'threats', 'administration', 'end', 'autonomy', 'detail', 'position', 'conditionality', 'principle', 'justice', 'donors', 'partners', 'recovery', 'interview', 'DEFENCEU', 'instance', 'ability', 'deliberations', 'cooperation', 'deals', 'resources', 'possibility', 'others', 'flexibility', 'compromise', 'majority', 'Ukrainian', 'SUMMIT', 'WAY', 'idea', 'West', 'Belgium', 'work', 'plan', 'retaliation', 'burden', 'Trump', 'January', 'offing', 'funding', 'allies', 'continuity']",2025-10-22,2025-10-23,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Photograph: Ronald Wittek/ EPAPotential snags in a legally complicated plan to use frozen Russian state assets to fund a huge loan to Ukraine continue to be teased out  with European Union (EU) leaders to resume discussions of the proposal at a summit on Thursday.Behind-the-scenes talks are taking place between senior EU officials and the European Central Bank to allay fears the move would effectively amount to confiscating the Russian assets  in breach of international law  and damage Europe’s reputation as a safe place for countries to put their money.The leaders of the EU’s 27 states are meeting in Brussels for a European Council summit  where many expect they will lend conditional support to the proposal.The idea is to use Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe to fund a €140 billion loan to Ukraine. The money would be repaid to Russia if it agreed to compensate Kyiv for the destruction caused by the war.The Russian state bonds  which have matured into cash  were immobilised by sweeping economic sanctions introduced after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Negotiations are continuing at senior levels about how exactly the EU would limit its possible legal exposure  with the 27 leaders to discuss the politics of the proposal on Thursday.The leaders are expected to call on the European Commission  the union’s executive arm led by Ursula von der Leyen  to come forward with concrete details about how the loan would work.In one draft of a joint statement being worked out  EU leaders state any plan to use the assets needs to be “in accordance with EU and international law and underpinned by appropriate EU solidarity and risk-sharing”.[ Merz calls on EU to use frozen Russian assets help UkraineOpens in new window ]Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will travel to Brussels to join the EU summit. Photograph: Johnathan Nackstrand/ AFP via Getty ImagesThe Russian assets are held in Euroclear  a bond depository in Belgium. The Belgian government has fiercely opposed previous suggestions they could be tapped or confiscated.Officials believe the loan would fund Kyiv’s defensive war effort for at least another two years  easing the financial burden on EU states to contribute more money from their budgets.In the past there was an acceptance the frozen Russian assets could not be touched. However  the accumulating windfall profits from the money were passed to Ukraine.Belgium is seeking a binding commitment that the costs from any Russian legal challenge to the loan  even years down the line  would be covered by the EU as a whole  rather than the Belgian state. There would also likely be a need to reform how the bloc’s sanctions on Russia are regularly renewed  to stop one capital from using a veto to block their rollover.A diplomat from one EU state said it was difficult to see all the issues being ironed out before the end of the year  or possibly at all. “This maybe should not be seen as the magical solution  because if for some reason it does not work  or it takes much more time than expected  then what do we do?”Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will travel to Brussels to join the EU summit  where he is likely to lay out the pressure Ukraine is facing from Russian air strikes.[ Europeans rush to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s defence after tense Donald Trump meetingOpens in new window ]On Wednesday  Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least seven people. The drone and missile attacks came after US president Donald Trump cancelled a planned summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.Russia said on Wednesday it had carried out a major training exercise involving nuclear weapons. It said it fired missiles from ground launchers  submarines and aircraft  including intercontinental ballistic weapons that are capable of striking the United States.Also on Wednesday  Sweden said it had signed a letter of intent to export Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine.Separately  French president Emmanuel Macron  German chancellor Friedrich Merz and 17 other leaders have sought an overhaul of the EU’s book of laws.The leaders asked for “a systematic review of all EU regulations”  to single out rules to pare back or repeal  in a letter to António Costa  who chairs the European Council summits.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful.

The anticipated acquisition is focused on the lead Phase I/II program ICT01 in first line acute myeloid leukemia (AML)3 patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. ICT01 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting BTN3A  a key immune-regulatory molecule broadly expressed across cancer  and received Orphan Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in July 2025.Many AML patients are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy and must rely on lower-intensity options  which often deliver limited and short-lived benefit.2 This high-risk  unfit population continues to face a significant unmet medical need  highlighting the urgency for new therapies that can improve survival and quality of life.“At completion  the acquisition of ImCheck Therapeutics presents an opportunity for us to expand our pipeline in oncology and reinforces our commitment to deliver transformative therapies to the people who need them most ” said David Loew  CEO  Ipsen. “We feel confident that with the ICT01 promising data combined with Ipsen’s global development and commercialization expertise  we are well positioned to start a Phase IIb/III trial in 2026.”Interim data (n=45) orally presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology 20251 from the Phase I/II EVICTION trial showed treatment with ICT01 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine (Ven-Aza) achieved very encouraging high responses. In this single-arm trial  treatment response nearly doubled relative to those seen in historical standard of care data across all molecular subtypes in newly diagnosed patients including sub-types typically less responsive to standard of care (Ven-Aza).2 ICT01 in combination with Ven-Aza was also shown to be well tolerated  underscoring ICT01’s potential as a novel immunotherapy to improve outcomes for patients with AML.“We are thrilled to become part of Ipsen  a company whose ambition for transformative care matches our commitment to bringing innovative treatments to patients. This transaction recognizes groundbreaking science originating from French academia ” said Pierre d’Epenoux  CEO  ImCheck Therapeutics. “It also highlights the exceptional work the ImCheck team and our partners have achieved to advance the understanding of butyrophilns and gamma delta T cells. Joining Ipsen will help us accelerate ICT01 toward registrational studies and commercialization. I remain grateful to the patients and investors for their contributions to furthering ImCheck’s pioneering science.”Transaction detailsUnder the terms of the agreement  through a wholly owned affiliate of Ipsen SAS  shareholders of ImCheck Therapeutics will receive a 350 million euros payment on a cash-free and debt-free basis at closing of the transaction  and deferred payments contingent upon the achievement of specified regulatory approvals and sales-based milestones  for a total potential consideration up to 1 billion euros.The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q1 2026  subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions including the expiration or termination of any required regulatory and governmental approvals under French and U.S. regulations.AdvisorsAllen & Overy Shearman (Paris) is acting as legal counsel to Ipsen. Centerview Partners is acting as exclusive financial advisor to ImCheck Therapeutics with Goodwin (London) and Dentons (Paris) acting as legal counsel.About the EVICTION trialEVICTION is a first-in-human  dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort-expansion (Part 2) clinical trial of ICT01 in patients with various advanced relapsed or refractory solid or hematologic cancers that have exhausted standard-of-care treatment options  as well as newly-diagnosed AML. More information on the EVICTION trial can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04243499).About ICT01ICT01 is a humanized  anti-BTN3A (also known as CD277) monoclonal antibody that promotes the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by γ9δ2 T cells  which are responsible for immunosurveillance of malignancy and infections. The three isoforms of BTN3A targeted by ICT01 are overexpressed on many solid tumors (e.g.  melanoma  urothelial cell  colorectal  ovarian  pancreatic  and lung cancer) and hematologic malignancies (e.g.  leukemia and lymphomas) and are also expressed on the surface of innate (e.g.  γδ T cells and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells). Binding to BTN3A is essential for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response of γ9δ2 T cells. By altering the conformation of BTN3A  ICT01 promotes this binding  thereby selectively activating circulating γ9δ2 T cells. This leads to migration of γ9δ2 T cells out of the circulation and into the tumor tissue  and triggers a downstream immunological cascade through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines  including but not limited to IFNγ and TNFα  further augmenting the anti-tumor immune response. Anti-tumor activity and efficacy of ICT01 have been shown in patients across several cancer indications.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by internal and external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

By unlocking the power of γ9δ2 T cells  ImCheck’s innovative approach has the potential to transform treatments across oncology  autoimmune  and infectious diseases.The lead clinical-stage program  ICT01  has been advancing to late-stage trials  demonstrating a unique mechanism of action that modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. These “first-in-class” activating antibodies may deliver superior clinical outcomes compared to first-generation immunotherapy approaches  in particular in rationale combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory anti-cancer drugs. Additionally  ImCheck’s pipeline compounds are progressing toward clinical development for autoimmune and infectious diseases.The company benefits from the pioneering research of Prof. Daniel Olive (Institut Paoli Calmettes  INSERM  CNRS  Aix-Marseille University)  a global leader in γ9δ2 T cells and butyrophilins  as well as the expertise of a seasoned management team and the commitment of leading French  European and U.S. investors including Kurma Partners  Eurazeo  Bpifrance through its Innobio 2 and Large Venture funds  Andera Partners  Pfizer Ventures  Gimv  EQT Life Sciences  Earlybird  Wellington Partners  Pureos Bioventures  Invus  Agent Capital  Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund  Alexandria Venture Investments  and Blood Cancer United (previously LLS)®.For further information: https://www.imchecktherapeutics.com/Ipsen ContactsInvestorsHenry Wheeler henry.wheeler@ipsen.com +33 7766471149Khalid Deojee khalid.deojee@ipsen.com +33 666019526MediaSally Bain sally.bain@ipsen.com +1 8573200517Anne Liontas anne.liontas.ext@ipsen.com +33 0767347296ImCheck ContactsMediaGretchen Schweitzer (EU and US) ImCheck@trophic.eu +49 1728618540Céline Voisin (France) Imcheck@atcg-partners.com +33 (0)6 62 12 53 39ReferencesDumas et al. γ9δ2 T-cell activation with ICT01 combined with azacitidine-venetoclax for older/unfit adults with newly diagnosed AML: preliminary efficacy and dose selection in Phase 1/2 study EVICTION.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements.

As a result  EBITDA(3) and net current cash flow will have grown by 23% and 21%  respectively  over the three years up to December 2025.Klépierre’s prime malls  strategically located in the most dynamic catchment areas of continental Europe  continue to deliver steady growth year-to-date:9-month net rental income up 6.5%  or 4.2% like-for-like ( 4 )   up sharply versus H1  up sharply versus H1 10% increase in Mall income earnings (retail media  events  specialty leasing & mobility)9-month retailer sales ( 5 ) up 3.3%  supported by a 2.3% increase in footfall  reflecting market share gainsup 3.3%  supported by a 2.3% increase in footfall  reflecting market share gains Sustained leasing demand: rental uplift at 4.6% year-to-date  accelerating from H1Best-in-class operating KPIs: occupancy at 97.0%  and occupancy cost ratio at 12.5%Backed by A-range credit ratings  the highest levels in the European listed real estate space  Klépierre issued a 12-year inaugural green bond for €500 million  the longest tenor for a European REIT in the euro debt capital markets since 2022  with a spread of 103 basis points.Klépierre continues to operate with best-in-class credit metrics in continental European real estate  with net debt to EBITDA of 6.9x and cost of debt at 1.9%.Undisputed ESG leadership: for the second year in a row  sole leader in the 2025 GRESB ranking across all European listed real estate  with a score of 95/100 and a five-star rating. Worldwide leader in the Retail space.Klépierre’s total revenue(6) for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €1 213.4 million.HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIODSustained business momentum with accelerating rental growthKlépierre’s portfolio of leading malls continued to gain market share  with footfall up 2.3% and retailer sales(5) up 3.3% over the first nine months of 2025. All countries contributed positively over the first nine months  with Northwest & Central Europe and Southern Europe leading the pack. Similarly  all segments contributed to growth  with standout performances in experience-based shopping categories such as health & beauty  entertainment and dining.High leasing demand for prime shopping malls translated into a sustained deal flow with omnichannel players opening new flagships and enlarging existing ones  as well as with newcomers in all verticals. Across its portfolio  Klépierre constantly adapts its offering to shopper demand and ensures a high-quality and diverse mix of stores in every segment  from fashion  health & beauty  sports and leisure to services and restaurants. Over the first nine months  this contributed to a 4.6% rental uplift on renewals and relettings while occupancy came in at a high 97.0%  up 50 basis points year-on-year.Meanwhile  the occupancy cost ratio stood at 12.5%  paving the way for further rental uplift.Over the period  the Group successfully delivered net rental income growth of 6.5%  driven by accretive acquisitions and a like-for-like contribution of 4.2% (240 basis points above indexation). This marks a sharp acceleration compared to the first half of the year  reflecting the full effects of improved operating metrics as well as further growth in Mall income  which ended the first nine months of the year up 10%. The Mall Income revenue stream (Retail Media  Events  Specialty Leasing and Mobility) represents a powerful incremental growth lever for Klépierre to unlock value by capitalizing on the 700 million annual visits to its malls.Accretive capital allocation and unrivalled credit profileKlépierre regularly invests in its assets to make them the preferred shopping centers for retailers and visitors. In this context  the Group delivered the first phase of the extension of Odysseum in Montpellier (France)  where Primark opened a flagship megastore of over 8 300 sq.m. in early September  that has already driven a tremendous 38% increase in footfall for the mall since opening. The second phase of the extension is advancing on time and on budget.In parallel  extension works have just started at Le Gru  the iconic 80 000 sq.m. shopping center in Turin (Italy). By 2027  in a fully refurbished and extended space  this retail hub will feature a wide range of new anchors  restaurants and services over more than 7 500 sq.m. of additional retail space. The yield-on-cost of these two projects stands at 9% and 10%  respectively.The Group continues to boast sector-leading credit metrics with net debt to EBITDA at 6.9x (the lowest among large European real-estate market capitalizations)  an average debt maturity of six years and a cost of debt of 1.9%  leaving room for disciplined capital allocation to further enhance value creation for shareholders.As of September 30  2025  consolidated net debt stood at €7 352 million.Undisputed leadership in sustainable developmentThrough its CSR strategy—under the Act4Good® banner—Klépierre is committed to building the most sustainable platform for commerce and  in particular  to achieving net zero by 2030  taking action in favor of the employees  customers  retailers and partners who are vital to the Group’s business.This commitment and the Group’s excellent performance have once again been recognized by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)  with the Group ranking first in the European Listed Real-Estate category (all asset classes combined).

The Group’s upgraded 2025 net current cash flow guidance per share implies 4% growth over one year  while the average year-to-date dividend yield(7) stands at 6%.This performance highlights the Group’s growth profile over the past three years  with EBITDA and net current cash flow per share up 23%(3) and 21%(3)  respectively.AGENDA February 19  2026 2025 full-year earnings (after market close) INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS MEDIA CONTACTS Paul Logerot  Group Head of IR and Financial Communication+33 (0)7 50 66 05 63 — paul.logerot@klepierre.comHugo Martins  IR Manager+33 (0)7 72 11 63 24 — hugo.martins@klepierre.comTanguy Phelippeau  IR Manager+33 (0)7 72 09 29 57 — tanguy.phelippeau@klepierre.com Hélène Salmon  Group Head of Communication+33 (0)6 43 41 97 18 – helene.salmon@klepierre.comWandrille Clermontel  Taddeo+33 (0)6 33 05 48 50 – teamklepierre@taddeo.frABOUT KLÉPIERREKlépierre is the European leader in shopping malls  with exclusive focus on continental Europe.

The contribution of acquired companies supported reported revenue  which increased by +4.6% over the period despite an unfavorable US dollar effect (-3.4%)Selling prices were broadly stable compared to the third quarter of 2024 (-0.3%)Given the continuing sluggish market and the weakness of the US dollar  the Group now estimates that adjusted EBITDA for 2025 will be close to that of 2024 (i.e. €329 million  compared to the target of €360 million announced at the beginning of the year)Paris  22 October 2025: The Supervisory Board of Tarkett (Euronext Paris: FR0004188670 TKTT) has reviewed the Group's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2025.The Group uses alternative performance indicators (not defined by IFRS standards) described in detail in the appendix to this document:Revenue in millions of euros Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Change Of which organic change EMEA 210.5 214.1 -1.7% -1.8% North America 207.8 218.7 -4.9% +2.2% CIS  APAC & Latin America 144.4 155.0 -6.8% -7.6% Sports 433.2 414.2 +4.6% -1.1% Group total 996.0 1 002.0 -0.6% -1.6%1. Third quarter 2025 revenueThe Group's net revenue amounted to €996 million in the third quarter of 2025  representing a slight decrease of -0.6% compared to the same period in 2024. Organic decline was -1.6%. Selling prices remained stable overall  with a limited variation of -0.3% compared to the third quarter of 2024.The EMEA segment generated revenue of €211 million in the third quarter of 2025  down -1.7% compared to the same period in 2024. This change includes a favorable currency effect of +0.1%  bringing the organic change to -1.8%. Activity remains sluggish in the residential segment  where the macroeconomic environment is hampering renovation and new construction projects across the area. Sales of commercial products for the healthcare  education and office sectors confirmed their resilience and increased compared to Q3 2024.The North America segment recorded revenue of €208 million in the third quarter of 2025  down -4.9% compared to the same period in 2024. This change reflects organic sales growth of +2.2%  an unfavorable currency effect of -4.8% linked to the weakening of the dollar and a scope effect of -2.3% linked to the sale of the distribution business in California in July 2024. The residential market remains very sluggish  and market indicators show no signs of recovery  with renovation and new construction projects being penalized by high lending rates and inflation. Activity in the commercial segments benefited over the summer from the catch-up in deliveries delayed by the implementation of the new logistics platform at the beginning of the year. However  September saw slower activity than last year  a trend that is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. The hospitality segment is growing compared to 2024.Revenue for the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €144 million in the third quarter of 2025  down -6.8% compared to the same period in 2024. This decline is due to a -7.6% decrease in organic sales (excluding price effects in CIS countries)  partially offset by a favorable currency effect of +0.8%. In Russia  which accounts for around 7% of the Group's total sales  the slowdown in demand led to a sharp decline in volumes of -13% over the quarter compared to 2024. Asia is growing thanks to good momentum in China and Southeast Asia. In Latin America  activity grew slightly in Brazil but declined in other countries in the region  such as Mexico.Revenue for the Sports segment amounted to €433 million in the third quarter of 2025  up +4.6% compared to the same period in 2024. This change includes organic growth of -1.1%  an unfavorable currency effect of -3.4% and a positive contribution of +9.1% from recent acquisitions. Sales for the quarter were down in artificial turf in the United States due to delays in project launch decisions in a regulatory and fiscal environment that has changed significantly. Athletics tracks are growing  as are European activities.2. Update on the public buy-out offerOn February 24  2025  Tarkett Participation  the controlling shareholder of Tarkett SA  filed a proposed public buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out on the Tarkett shares it does not already own. The public buy-out offer was opened from June 11 to June 24  2025  inclusive. Since the closing of the public buy-out offer  Tarkett Participation holds 97.11% of the capital of Tarkett SA.An appeal against the AMF's clearance decision dated June 5  2025  has been filed by a minority shareholder before the Paris Court of Appeal on June 16  2025. The Court of Appeal's decision is expected to be handed down at the end of November.3. OutlookAfter the first half of the year in which the Group's activity remained stable in a sluggish market  the continuing difficult macroeconomic environment is further hampering renovation and new construction projects.Residential markets remain very slow in Europe and the United States  with no sign of recovery in the short term. In Russia and certain CIS countries  the slowdown in demand in the residential segment is accelerating due to the combined effect of high interest rates and sustained inflation.The commercial segments  which account for nearly 80% of the Group's business  are proving more resilient  particularly in Europe  where the Group has posted solid performance since the beginning of 2025. However  there are no signs of a recovery in demand. In North America  the slowdown in orders seen in the third quarter will weigh on year-end activity.The Sports segment remains buoyant  although the situation in North America has led to the postponement of certain projects in 2025  slowing the pace of market growth. After a third quarter that fell short of expectations  the installation of artificial turf sports fields should decline slightly over the year.Combined with the weakening of the dollar  these perspectives have led the Group to revise its Adjusted EBITDA forecast (including scope effect) for the 2025 financial year  which should be close to that of 2024 (i.e. €329 million  compared to an objective of €360 million announced at the beginning of the year).Nevertheless  the Group considers that it is well positioned to serve the structural needs of the market  particularly in sports facilities  buildings for the healthcare and education sectors  and housing. The structural cost reduction measures taken from 2024 onwards help to mitigate the effects of weak volumes and offer prospects for improved results when demand recovers.This press release may contain forward-looking information.

Positive results from the global ElevAATe phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05856331) showed that efdoralprin alfa (SAR447537  formerly known as INBRX-101)  met all primary and key secondary endpoints when dosed every three weeks (Q3W) or four weeks (Q4W) in adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) emphysema  a rare disease. Efdoralprin alfa is an investigational recombinant human alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)-Fc fusion protein. It demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean increase in functional AAT levels within normal range as measured by trough concentrations at steady state compared to those receiving weekly plasma-derived augmentation therapy at week 32 [p<0.0001]. The study also met key secondary endpoints  demonstrating superior mean increase in fAAT average concentration as well as higher percentage of days above the lower limit of the normal range for both Q3W and Q4W dosing.The recombinant efdoralprin alfa was well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile to plasma-derived therapy. Additional safety follow-up will be assessed in the ElevAATe OLE phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05897424).“These data demonstrate that efdoralprin alfa achieved consistently higher normal functional AAT levels  with less frequent dosing  compared to a current standard of care ” said Christopher Corsico  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “This is particularly meaningful as maintaining protective protein levels is the cornerstone of pulmonary management of AATD and currently available treatments require weekly therapeutic infusions. The ElevAATe results represent the potential for efdoralprin alfa to be a restorative recombinant therapeutic option for the AATD community  reinforcing our commitment to develop treatments for both rare and respiratory conditions with great unmet medical need.”“AATD is a debilitating condition that can be challenging to treat ” said Igor Barjaktarevic  MD  PhD  Associate Professor  David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and primary investigator on the ElevAATe phase 2 study. “Achieving and maintaining normal AAT levels with less frequent dosing and with complete independence from blood donation programs would be a welcome change to the current treatment experience for people living with AATD. With the current standard of care  patients reach but do not maintain normal protein levels between the infusions  leaving a remaining unmet need. I’m encouraged by the ElevAATe trial results and what efdoralprin alfa could mean for the AATD community.”Efdoralprin alfa was previously granted fast track and orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AATD emphysema. Efdoralprin alfa is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Sanofi plans to present the data at a forthcoming medical meeting and engage with global regulatory authorities on the appropriate next steps.About AATDAATD is a rare  inherited disorder characterized by low levels or absence of AAT  a protein produced by the liver that protects the lungs from inflammation and damage.1 3 The disease causes progressive deterioration of the tissue of the lungs and liver.1 4 Without adequate AAT levels  affected individuals often experience lung damage and develop COPD  including emphysema  and in severe forms of the disease  patients can sometimes require lung transplantation. Plasma-derived therapies were introduced in 1987 to treat the condition but since then  no new therapies have been introduced. About 235 000 people worldwide live with AATD  with nearly 100 000 people in the US  but about 90% of individuals with AATD are likely undiagnosed.About efdoralprin alfaEfdoralprin alfa (SAR447537  formerly known as INBRX-101) is a recombinant human AAT-Fc fusion protein being investigated as a restorative therapy in adults with AATD emphysema  with Q3W or Q4W dosing. The investigational treatment is being studied to restore functional AAT levels to the normal range and inhibit neutrophil elastase  an enzyme that can cause lung tissue damage in patients with AATD. Efdoralprin alfa was granted fast track designation and orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of AATD emphysema.About ElevAATeThe ElevAATe phase 2 study was a double-blind  randomized study evaluating efdoralprin alfa versus a standard of care plasma-derived augmentation therapy in patients with AATD emphysema. ​Ninety-seven patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive efdoralprin alfa every three weeks or every four weeks  or plasma-derived augmentation therapy once weekly. The primary endpoint was the mean change in average fAAT concentrations as measured from baseline to average serum trough fAAT concentrations at steady state in patients treated with efdoralprin alfa Q3W or Q4W compared with weekly plasma-derived augmentation therapy  following a treatment period of up to 32 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included mean change in serum fAAT concentration from baseline to fAAT average concentrations at steady state and percentage of days that steady-state functional AAT levels were above the lower limit of the normal range.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

That unfortunately  in my opinion  there is today in Greece only one — and not at least two or more — parties that “side with” common sense. Because it’s just common sense that the monument to the “Unknown Soldier” should be kept clear of any other events. Self-evident things  really. Unfortunately (I repeat)  PASOK also knows full well — as does everyone else  I think — that yesterday’s amendment had nothing to do with the issue of gatherings in Syntagma Square. Now  what’s the need for a party with a tradition in governance  even if only in the past  to humiliate itself and… pull out the measuring stick to claim the amendment is unconstitutional because the ban “covers the rest of the square too ” etc.  is frankly beyond understanding. However  it’s not the first time one fails to understand why PASOK  instead of trying to “carve out space” from ND and mainly from the Center  keeps mimicking SYRIZA and Zoe (Konstantopoulou). The polling data showing it coming in third  after Tsipras — or even fourth if Karystianou runs — is  I think  precisely due to this tactic. Because people prefer the original to the replica. The conclusion  before we get into the details of yesterday’s day in Parliament  is that regardless of what happens in the end at the elections (still far away  barring surprises)  Mitsotakis and his government stand where the “YES” side stood in the 2015 Euro referendum — and everyone else is on the “NO” side. It’s up to him  from that 30% that keeps circling around in the polls  to draw a bit more from that remaining 10% reservoir that’s currently empty.Dendias’ AbsenceYesterday  there was a lot of chatter in Parliament about the absence of Nikos Dendias from the government benches during the discussion of the government’s amendment concerning the Unknown Soldier — even though the regulation basically falls under his ministry. In his place went his deputy  Thanasis Davakis  who usually shows up at parades and such. Instead  the Minister of Defense chose  at 7 p.m.  to attend the event next door at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel — the presentation of the Hellenic Army General Staff’s anniversary edition titled “General Headquarters Operations Diary 1940–1941.” On this matter — meaning Dendias’ absence — Androulakis “called out” Mitsotakis  and he was  of course  right.M.MNaturally  at M.M they didn’t exactly jump for joy over Dendias’ stance — even if they didn’t crank up the volume  sticking instead to the line “at least he signed the amendment.” Possibly  both M.M and K.M himself have accepted that this is how Dendias will be from now on. Still  I repeat  this kind of “half-season” stance on such an issue clearly doesn’t suit Dendias’ profile — but  well  to each his own taste…The Monument  President Nikos  and the MPs’ ReactionsYesterday in Parliament we indeed saw Androulakis brandishing his sword against the amendment for the protection of the Unknown Soldier’s monument — spitting fire (as the saying goes  let’s throw in a silly line or two)  accusing the government of anti-democratic reflexes and constitutional violations. And I really wondered what PASOK’s MPs were thinking. I say this because just a few hours earlier  during an informal meeting of the Green parliamentary group at 9 a.m.  the MPs were informed of the president’s directive to file an objection of unconstitutionality — without any consultation whatsoever. A pre-decided move taken by President Nikos and his close associates and imposed top-down  as the old comrades would have said. I also hear that not everyone liked that pre-decided move — quite the opposite  in fact — since Nadia Giannakopoulou  Evangelia Liakouli  and Apostolos Panas expressed objections  arguing that the leadership’s decision to oppose the amendment puts them at odds with their voters’ wishes.Euro-meetingsIntensive talks are underway daily to finalize the plan that the government will submit to the European Commission regarding OPEKEPE. The European dimension of the negotiation is handled largely by Vice President Hatzidakis  who will be in Brussels tonight  as the EPP Summit — of which he is vice president — meets Thursday morning. While he’s there  he’s scheduled to meet on Thursday with the European Commission’s Director-General for Agriculture  Elizabeth Werner  as November 4 is the deadline for submitting the Greek plan on cross-checks and payments. I also hear he’ll be seeing our old friend at the Commission  Declan Costello  for a review of the Recovery Fund’s progress.Kimberly Guilfoyle Will Wish Us a Happy New MonthThe countdown has begun for Kimberly’s arrival in Greece  judging by the frantic pace of preparations at the U.S. Embassy. I assume the Ambassador will wish us a “happy new month.” Then she’ll host the two ministers who will participate in the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Partnership Conference  scheduled for November 6–7. These are Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the Secretary of the Interior — who’s coming  however  in his capacity as chair of the National Energy Dominance Council — Doug Burgum  just as during his previous visit to Greece. Afterwards  Kimberly will present her credentials to the President of the Republic  as protocol dictates.All Gathered for G. Stournaras — in the Hall Where He Got His DegreeBefore moving on to market topics  I must mention yesterday’s EKPA event presenting the honorary volume “Studies in Honor of Professor Giannis Stournaras” to the Governor of the Bank of Greece. In the university’s grand hall  at the main building  present were: the Speaker of Parliament Konstantinos Tasoulas  Deputy Prime Minister K. Hatzidakis  Ministers Pierrakakis  Floridis  Papastavrou  Georgiadis  Petralias  Theodorikakos  Kerameos  Alpha Bank CEO Vassilis Psaltis  business figures Marianna Latsis  Giannis Vardinogiannis (Motor Oil)  Alexandros Exarchou (AKTOR Group)  Spyros Theodoropoulos  Dimitris Kallitsantsis  Piraeus Bank CEO Christos Megalou  Credia Bank CEO Eleni Vrettou  Evangelos Venizelos  Andreas Loverdos  Makis Voridis  Euclid Tsakalotos  Grigoris Dimitriadis  NBG Chairman Gikas Hardouvelis  Eurobank Chairman Giorgos Zanias  and others. EKPA Rector Professor Gerasimos Siasos  in his address to G. Stournaras  remarked: “Whatever he’s done  however high he’s risen  he remains the same person — and I’m glad that here  in this very hall where he earned his degree with honors  today we pay tribute to him.”How Deutsche Bank Stirred Up PPC and Winked at OTEAnalysts from Deutsche Bank had a meeting with PPC’s telecommunications executives — but when they later read the published report  they probably weren’t too thrilled. DB issued a report on OTE  but titled it “We Met with PPC  the Price Disruptor in Greece.” The analysts devote a large section to explaining why PPC’s decision to enter telecommunications poses a high investment risk. Specifically  DB analysts led by Giannis Karydis note that the reason PPC decided to spend capital on developing a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network ceased to apply recently  as the market has already achieved wide coverage through other providers. Thus  the company is now forced to spend more in hopes of recouping part of its roughly €250 million investment in telecom infrastructure to date. They argue that OTE / Nova / Vodafone are not “easy targets ” and therefore PPC risks suffering heavy operating losses in addition to its already significant capital expenditures. In short  DB doesn’t seem to believe that PPC’s entry into retail fiber will push OTE / Nova / Vodafone to strike wholesale deals with PPC — since that would devalue their own infrastructure. The report concludes with OTE  maintaining a “buy” recommendation for its stock with a target price of €20  stressing that the company remains attractively valued and financially solid. Overall  the report made waves — and seems likely to spark yet another round of confrontation among telecom market players at a time when tempers are already running high. Of course. Below is the full English translation of your Greek text — rendered with maximum accuracy  equivalent idioms  and natural phrasing that conveys the exact tone and nuance of the original  including humor and business jargon  without adding anything extra. The paragraphing exactly mirrors the original structure.Why the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition didn’t move the Athens Stock ExchangeThe major acquisition deal of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) — despite its size ($2.6 billion) — is not expected to significantly affect the bottom line of the Greek-listed Coca-Cola HBC  because the African company is burdened with exceptionally high debt. That’s also why the Coca-Cola HBC stock didn’t seem moved on the market. It came under pressure  recorded losses of up to 3%  and finally closed with a small gain (+0.20%). CCBA indeed operates in 14 African markets; it is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Africa and handles 40% of its soft drink volume. The real benefit  however  is that with this acquisition  3E (Coca-Cola HBC) establishes itself as a key player on a continent destined for growth. From now on  Coca-Cola HBC will be listed on three major stock exchanges — in London  Johannesburg (Africa’s largest)  and Euronext via Athens. The stock market goal of the acquisition is to upgrade the company’s growth profile  reduce its dependence on “mature” European markets  and place 3E on the radar of more institutional investors.PPC: Data centers included in Group forecastsWith €7.8 million in trading value  PPC’s share (+0.69% at €14.58) reached a market capitalization of €5.38 billion yesterday. There are many investment expectations ahead of PPC management’s planned Investor’s Day in November. Sources indicate that  for the first time  data centers will be included in the Group’s financial forecasts. The dividend of €0.70 per share appears secured.Mr. Euronext’s flirtationA lot of talk followed the reference by Euronext’s CEO to what he called a paradox regarding Greek shipping companies — that more of them are listed in Oslo than in Athens.“The lack of quality in the local market (meaning the ASE) is one of the reasons they are not listed in Athens. This is going to change with the entry of HELEX into Euronext ” Boujnah stressed at his press conference the day before yesterday. Indeed  at the Oslo Stock Exchange — which  it should be noted  has been acquired and is part of the Euronext Group — several Greek-owned shipping companies have found… safe harbor  but only to raise capital through bond issues. A few months ago  Performance Shipping Inc.  owned by Aliki Paliou  raised $100 million through a bond issue in the Scandinavian market  while other major players like Navios South American Logistics  Contships  Seanergy  and Diana Shipping also turned north to raise significant funds on more favorable terms than classic bank loans. The latest development concerns Navios Partners of Angeliki Frangou  which is considering issuing a Norwegian bond as it accelerates its fleet renewal program.Okeanis Eco Tankers Corp. (Alafouzos Group) is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange  while most Greek shipping companies have opted for the U.S. and Nasdaq; only two are currently listed on the Athens Exchange. So  Boujnah will either try to attract more Greek shipowners to Euronext Athens (if the ASE acquisition succeeds)  or the bonds now being issued via Oslo will move further south — to Athens.Of course  this comes at a time when the public offer is still “running ” and so are Mr. Euronext’s promises.The HELEX exchange ratioAnd since we’re on Euronext  let’s continue by noting that Stéphane Boujnah’s assurance that Euronext will not increase its offer price for HELEX “by even one cent” put pressure on the stock. The Parisian was being honest. On the other hand  he was telling only half the truth when he described the proposed exchange as very attractive — since it values HELEX at 22 times its 2024 earnings. Last year  HELEX’s total annual profit reached €17 million. This year  its first-half profits already exceeded €14 million  and trading volumes on the Exchange have been rising sharply over the past three months. Therefore  based on expected 2025 profitability  the exchange ratio looks less attractive.Sale (and leaseback) of the Costeas-Geitonas School facilitiesIn the coming period  the sale and leaseback of the main facilities of Costeas-Geitonas Schools in Pallini is expected to be completed  while the project for the new school in Elliniko — currently at the approval stage — is also underway. The new school  with a capacity of 1 500–1 700 students  is set to welcome its first pupils in September 2028. It’s worth recalling that in July 2024  the company — now led by the second generation of the Geitonas family — changed hands and joined the Inspired Education Group. Inspired operates in 18 countries  with over 120 schools and more than 95 000 students in primary and secondary education  and the sale & leaseback deal follows naturally from that acquisition. In Pallini  the facilities cover a total area of 67 000 sq.m.  with more than 14 000 sq.m. of indoor space  housing around 102 classrooms and labs  among other facilities. In terms of figures  2024 turnover amounted to €17.9 million  compared to €17 million in 2023 (+5.38%). However  last year’s results showed losses of €17 million versus profits of €3.6 million  with after-tax losses of €17.55 million versus €2.8 million in 2023. According to management  this “was not due to loss-making operations  but to additional provisions for doubtful debts (€2 million)  property impairment (€12 million)  and a €3 million charge for goodwill from prior years not amortized by 31/12/2023.” They add that “the company conducted an evaluation and identified the following factors: a positive net position of €17.75 million  high liquidity of €4.36 million  no debt  total liabilities of €2.8 million (short-term liabilities minus deferred income) against current assets of €10.4 million  total provisions for risks of €14 million in the closing year  and turnover of €17.9 million (from €16.99 million in 2023).” For the Elliniko investment  management notes that “it is a landmark project that will strengthen both the company’s reputation and its revenue and profits.” The schools have also recorded deferred income of €10.66 million (vs. €8.96 million on 31/12/23)  referring to tuition fees for the academic year 1/9/24–31/8/25  which belong to the 2025 fiscal year and are allocated — as always — according to the matching principle.Greek shipowners between China and Wall StreetThe recent upheaval in Chinese port duties  implemented within just a few days  has highlighted the ability of Greek-listed shipping firms to move swiftly and strategically. At Dorian LPG  owned by John and Alex Hadjipateras  analysis of the new regulations became a daily puzzle: a ship en route to a Chinese port forced the finance team to decipher the meaning of the new customs form. CFO Ted Young emphasized that the company is operating with limited information  trying to manage uncertainty around dual-passport owners and U.S. ownership thresholds (the 25% American-shareholder limit) to avoid sudden penalties. Tsakos Energy Navigation is keeping a lower profile but closely monitoring the implementation of the 25% U.S. ownership rule. Management notes that interpretation of the regulations remains under discussion  leaving chartering and scheduling under a high-alert regime. Costamare  owned by Kostis Konstantakopoulos  issued a special share class to ensure that no U.S. shareholder controls more than 25% of the company. Petros Pappas’s Star Bulk responded with immediate operational moves: some ships altered speed and routes to meet deadlines  while the compliance team is reviewing the fleet’s Chinese vs. non-Chinese-built vessels to minimize fee exposure. Okeanis Eco Tankers made immediate changes to its board  with two U.S. members stepping down to bring the percentage of American directors below 25%. At Danaos  American board member William Repko resigned — a move described as preventive but necessary for compliance with the new Chinese framework. On the market side  shares of Greek shipping companies on the NYSE showed volatility  but traders view the uncertainty as an opportunity for arbitrage — a chance to exploit market imbalances. Fleet diversification  board restructuring  and proactive risk management are strengthening Greek interests in a market where regulatory risk turns into an advantage for those who know how to handle it. As insiders put it: “In shipping  just like on Wall Street  crises are raw materials for profit — and the Greeks know how to process them.”The Greek “early movers” and new shipbuilding orders in ChinaAt a time when  as we mentioned earlier  the global shipbuilding market is redefining its balance  two of the most powerful Greek names in shipping — Thanasis Martinos’s Eastern Mediterranean Maritime and Stamatis Tsantanis’s Nasdaq-listed Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. — are making their bets clear: on Chinese shipyards. EastMed is said to have signed with Hengli Heavy Industry for four new dry bulk carriers — all Kamsarmax-type vessels. Beyond its strategic meaning  the move sends a clear signal of confidence in the quality and know-how of Chinese shipbuilding. Seanergy  according to reports  is in talks to order a Capesize vessel. Kamsarmax and Capesize ships form the backbone of the global dry bulk fleet. For shipowners like Martinos and Tsantanis  this choice means investing in fleets with lower operating costs and higher resale value. Greek shipowners — traditionally early movers in global markets — are once again showing they know how to read world trends before they solidify.And this time  their gaze turns eastward.Greek shipowners’ landing in ShanghaiMeanwhile  the Chinese market these days is filled with the physical presence of Greek shipowners. Many have come to take delivery of ships they ordered; others to place new orders; many to meet and talk with their bankers and leasing financiers; and quite a few to discuss the new measures imposed by the Chinese government concerning vessel ownership nationality. Two days ago  a conference was held in Shanghai with significant Greek participation. Among the opening speakers was Minister Vassilis Kikilias (via video)  while today the baton passed to the Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS)  Thomas Kazakos  and the President of the Hellenic Shipping Banking Association  Giorgos Xiradakis. In Shanghai were also present Giorgos Prokopiou  Panos Laskaridis  Panos Zafet of Balthellas Group  Captain Stefanos Angelakos  and senior executives from Greek-owned shipping companies listed on Wall Street. There wasn’t a single flight without a strong Greek contingent on board. It seems brokers — and there are many of them — have already picked up signals of falling prices for new orders.,negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,mixed,0.17,0.19,0.64,True,English,"['Common sense', 'Nikos A.', 'Monument', 'Syntagma', 'Dendias', 'MPs', 'Kimberly', 'arrival', 'shipowners', 'Shanghai', 'Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Partnership Conference', 'Energy Secretary Chris Wright', 'Hellenic Army General Staff', 'General Headquarters Operations Diary', 'Grande Bretagne” hotel', 'Happy New Month', 'U.S. Embassy', 'Green parliamentary group', 'last national elections', 'Vice President Hatzidakis', 'parliamentary debate', 'common sense', 'Unknown Soldier', 'other events', 'Self-evident things', 'measuring stick', 'first time', 'polling data', 'YES” side', '2015 Euro referendum', 'NO” side', 'remaining 10% reservoir', 'Thanasis Davakis', 'anniversary edition', 'M.M', 'K.M', 'half-season” stance', 'President Nikos', 'anti-democratic reflexes', 'constitutional violations', 'informal meeting', 'close associates', 'old comrades', 'Nadia Giannakopoulou', 'Evangelia Liakouli', 'Apostolos Panas', 'voters’ wishes', 'Intensive talks', 'European dimension', 'EPP Summit', 'Elizabeth Werner', 'old friend', 'Declan Costello', 'Recovery Fund', 'frantic pace', 'Nikos Dendias', 'Dendias’ stance', 'Dendias’ profile', 'two years', 'European Commission', 'two ministers', 'Syntagma Square', 'Dendias’ Absence', 'silly line', 'Greek plan', 'Kimberly Guilfoyle', 'The Monument', 'government benches', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'citizens', 'opinion', 'Greece', 'one', 'parties', 'PASOK', 'amendment', 'issue', 'gatherings', 'need', 'party', 'tradition', 'governance', 'past', 'ban', 'rest', 'understanding', 'space', 'Center', 'SYRIZA', 'Zoe', 'Konstantopoulou', 'Tsipras', 'Karystianou', 'tactic', 'people', 'original', 'replica', 'conclusion', 'details', 'yesterday', 'surprises', 'Mitsotakis', 'polls', 'lot', 'chatter', 'discussion', 'regulation', 'ministry', 'place', 'deputy', 'parades', 'Defense', 'presentation', 'matter', 'Androulakis', 'joy', 'volume', 'kind', 'taste', 'MPs', 'Reactions', 'sword', 'protection', 'fire', 'saying', '9 a', 'directive', 'objection', 'unconstitutionality', 'consultation', 'move', 'decided', 'fact', 'leadership', 'decision', 'odds', 'Euro-meetings', 'OPEKEPE', 'negotiation', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'Director-General', 'Agriculture', 'November', 'deadline', 'cross-checks', 'payments', 'review', 'progress', 'countdown', 'arrival', 'preparations', 'Ambassador', '7']",2025-10-22,2025-10-23,en.protothema.gr
