53331,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/626868-eu-steal-russian-money-scheme/,The EU wants to steal Russian money and give it to Ukraine. How is that supposed to work?,The bloc’s leaders have been pressuring Belgium for months to allow it seize Russian sovereign funds Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc’s leaders have been pressuring Belgium for months to allow it to seize Russian sovereign fundsEU leaders are considering a long-developed and highly controversial plan to use Russian sovereign funds frozen in Belgium to finance Ukraine’s conflict with Russia.Up to now the EU has given Kiev about €180 billion ($208 billion). Reconstruction costs at present are estimated at approximately €480 billion ($556 billion). Ukraine’s economy is crumbling and it has just announced a record war budget.What’s the scheme?The EU is proposing to “borrow” Russia’s money (reportedly some €160 billion) from Euroclear  a privately owned company in Belgium  with all member states promising to pay it back when  as they put it  Ukraine wins the war and Russia agrees to pay reparations.Isn’t that wishful thinking?The “reparations loan” idea assumes Ukraine will win the war and Russia will agree to pay reparations. Neither of those is likely.How would it work out then? READ MORE: Kremlin warns of ‘boomerang’ over West’s latest asset-tapping plan The EU could then forgive Kiev’s debt – but it would still have to repay the money it borrowed from Euroclear.Who would ultimately pay?Probably European taxpayers – not a politically popular or sustainable idea in a bloc where the far-right is surging electorally and Brussels forces through an agenda on militarization.And what about the bankers?European central bankers fear a legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability – as well as destroying the euro’s reputation as a safe space.OK  so the EU wants to take and use Russian money held privately in Belgium. Who has said what?Read more Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever  whose country hosts Euroclear  where most EU-held Russian assets sit  has warned that “there’s no free money. There are always consequences.” “I want their signature saying  if we take [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s money… we’re all going to be responsible if it goes wrong.” Luxembourg’s prime minister  Luc Frieden  voiced similar apprehensions.De Wever has refused to move unless he gets 100% backing from EU members – Belgium will not support the EU’s plan to use frozen Russian sovereign assets as collateral for a massive loan to Ukraine unless the financial risks are shared across all member states.The ECB’s Christine Lagarde has warned that breaking the law to steal Russia’s money could crash the euro’s reputation as a stable currency: A legally contentious move could undermine the euro’s credibility  deter investment in euro-denominated assets  and pose a risk to financial stability. “From my vantage point  and with in mind financial stability and the strength of the euro  we will be looking very attentively to make sure that what is proposed is in accordance with international law (and) is mindful of financial stability ” Lagarde said.Days before the EU summit  Italy’s Georgia Meloni warned the bloc’s leaders to respect international law.How divided is the EU?France wants the money to be spent on European weapons and generally financing the Ukrainian state. Germany wants the money to be spent on weapons only. Other EU members think Kiev should decide how to spend the money.Has Kiev got a say?Kiev itself insists there be no restrictions on how the money would be spent – a stance widely regarded with skepticism in the EU given the risk of cash being siphoned off into Ukraine’s notorious graft channels.What does Russia think and what has it warned of?Russia is thought to hold some €200 billion in EU funds – most of which is privately owned.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that “smarter” governments oppose the seizure of Russian assets as“they understand that it would fundamentally undermine all principles of international economic activity and  without a doubt  cause enormous harm to the... international financial system.”Read more Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned of a “boomerang” if Russian assets are tapped to finance Kiev  telling reporters earlier this month that “these plans are all about the illegal seizure of Russian property. We are talking about theft ” Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “If someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution in one way or another.”“These are all steps towards the complete destruction of trust in the principle of property inviolability. The boomerang will hit countries which host the main depositories and are interested in investment attractiveness very hard ” he warned.Peskov has likened the EU to a group of mobsters planning their next heist. “This all looks like a gang: someone keeps lookout  someone robs  and someone  like Belgium  shouts  ‘Guys  let’s share responsibility.”,neutral,0.01,0.83,0.17,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Russian money', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'most EU-held Russian assets', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'notorious graft channels', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'international economic activity', 'latest asset-tapping plan', 'international financial system', 'record war budget', 'global financial stability', 'European central bankers', 'Other EU members', 'Russian property', 'euro-denominated assets', 'European taxpayers', 'financial risks', 'international law', 'EU funds', 'Russian money', 'controversial plan', 'Reconstruction costs', 'member states', 'legal precedent', 'safe space', 'Luc Frieden', 'similar apprehensions', 'massive loan', 'The ECB', 'stable currency', 'contentious move', 'vantage point', 'Georgia Meloni', 'Ukrainian state', 'smarter” governments', 'enormous harm', 'legal prosecution', 'one way', 'complete destruction', 'main depositories', 'next heist', 'European weapons', 'property inviolability', 'sustainable idea', 'Christine Lagarde', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'illegal seizure', 'investment attractiveness', 'EU summit', 'reparations loan', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'free money', 'EU leaders', 'bloc', 'Belgium', 'months', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'Kiev', 'economy', 'scheme', 'Euroclear', 'company', 'boomerang', 'West', 'debt', 'popular', 'Brussels', 'agenda', 'militarization', 'reputation', 'country', 'consequences', 'signature', 'Luxembourg', 'collateral', 'credibility', 'mind', 'strength', 'accordance', 'Italy', 'France', 'Germany', 'say', 'restrictions', 'stance', 'skepticism', 'cash', 'principles', 'doubt', 'reporters', 'plans', 'theft', 'Wednesday', 'someone', 'steps', 'trust', 'countries', 'group', 'mobsters', 'gang', 'responsibility']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,rt.com

Russia has denounced any use of its immobilized assets as outright theft.Touching sovereign assets is “something that’s never been done before – not even during World War II ” the prime minister told reporters. If the pro-Kiev “coalition of the willing” is not ready to bear the risks  there’s “no point in continuing ” he added.“We know there are vast amounts of Russian money in other countries that remain silent on this ” De Wever stated. “If we move  we must move all together. That’s European solidarity.”Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has likewise cautioned that the EU must avoid undermining “the financial and monetary stability of our economies and the euro area” when considering any steps involving the assets.Russian President Vladimir Putin previously asserted that “smarter” European governments understand the danger the proposed loan to Ukraine poses to the stability of the global financial system.,neutral,0.01,0.66,0.33,negative,0.01,0.46,0.54,True,English,"['EU pressure', 'Russian assets', 'Belgium', 'Kiev', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Brussels-based Euroclear clearinghouse', 'World War II', 'The European Commission', 'smarter” European governments', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'EU leaders’ summit', 'Touching sovereign assets', 'global financial system', 'European Union', 'Russian money', 'European solidarity', 'member states', 'collective risk-sharing', 'largest portion', 'outright theft', 'pro-Kiev “coalition', 'vast amounts', 'other countries', 'euro area', 'financial risks', 'reparation loan', 'massive loan', 'monetary stability', 'members', 'bloc', 'Belgium', 'plan', 'collateral', 'Ukraine', 'Thursday', 'opposition', 'everything', 'power', 'guarantees', 'scheme', 'Moscow', 'reparations', 'funds', 'something', 'reporters', 'willing', 'point', 'economies', 'steps', 'danger']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,rt.com

His Finnish counterpart  Petteri Orpo  said he hoped the European Commission would come up with a concrete proposal soon  so assets would be available next year.But Belgium  home to the Euroclear securities depository that holds the biggest tranche of frozen assets – worth some $225bn – expressed doubts over its legality.“I have not even seen the legal basis for the decision yet ” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters upon his arrival at the summit. He said his country would “stop the decision” if Belgium’s demands were not met.“I share the Belgian prime minister’s concerns but am confident we will take a step forward ” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters.EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said the bloc was ready to work on a mechanism to ensure Belgium received the legal guarantees it was seeking. The risks on Russian assets needed to be shared  she said.AdvertisementReporting from Brussels  Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said countries were “on the verge” of making an announcement  but alluded to wrangling over whether Kyiv should use the loan to buy European or US arms.“The Germans  the French  and the Italians were saying: ‘If we release that money  it has to go to European manufacturers of weapons to be used to benefit Europe as well ’” he said.A senior official in Zelenskyy’s administration told news agency Reuters that Ukraine needed the funds by the end of the year and autonomy over how to spend them.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova vowed a “painful response” from Moscow. She warned that any seizure of Russia’s assets would be illegal  describing their confiscation as “theft”.EU and US align on sanctionsSpeaking at the summit  Zelenskyy thanked the United States and the EU for agreeing on new energy sanctions against Russia  saying they were “very important”.He received a boost on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia for the first time since returning to the White House  targeting Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft.On Thursday  Zelenskyy was bolstered further by the EU’s greenlighting of a 19th package of EU sanctions against Russia that will hit Russia’s revenue streams through “new energy  financial  and trade measures”  according to the Danish rotating presidency.“It targets Russian banks  crypto exchanges  entities in India and China  among others ” EU’s Kallas said in a post on X.The sanctions will see the EU blacklist more tankers in Russia’s “shadow fleet”  used to get around oil export restrictions  and impose new rules on Moscow’s diplomats to curb their travel around Europe.Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the package’s ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports was an important step towards a complete phasing out of Russian energy in the EU.Slovakia  which continues to import energy from Russia  had been the final obstacle to the deal. Populist Prime Minister Robert Fico  who has close ties to Moscow  had sought assurances on high energy prices and protections for Slovakia’s car industry.Speaking at a Russian Foreign Ministry briefing  Zakharova slammed the US measures on Thursday  describing them as counterproductive. Addressing the EU sanctions  she said EU “elites” had to accept their measures were not working.“Russian goals in Ukraine remain unchanged  and the root causes of the conflict need to be resolved ” she told reporters.AdvertisementFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Trump had aligned himself with “loony” Europe  describing the sanctions as an act of war.Reporting from Moscow  Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said the EU and US measures would be “very painful” for Russia and would “definitely hurt the economy”.“The Kremlin has said that Russia has developed a certain immunity to them  and continues to function  but those who are familiar with the whole situation say that the new sanctions will make the continuation of Russian oil supplies to countries like India  for instance  impossible ” she said.The US Treasury has given companies until November 21 to wind down their transactions with the Russian oil producers. Indian oil industry sources told Reuters that refiners were poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil following the US sanctions.“There will be a massive cut. We don’t anticipate it will go to zero immediately as there will be some barrels coming into the market” before the deadline  a refinery source said.Trump said on Wednesday that he would raise concerns about China’s purchases of Russian oil during his sit-down with President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea next week.No territorial concessionsThe Brussels summit takes place after Trump said his plan for a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin  which had caused consternation among Kyiv’s European allies  was on hold because he did not want it to be a “waste of time”.Following tense talks between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House last week  in which the former told the latter he would have to make territorial concessions to Russia  European leaders had been eager to show that Ukraine could still count on their support.But they are also on high alert after a series of Russian air incursions and mysterious drone flights in European airspace and are likely to sign off on a new “road map” to prepare Europe to defend itself against a Russian attack by the end of the decade.Earlier this week  Ukraine’s strongest European backers  who form part of the “coalition of the willing”  said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace.The United Kingdom will host a meeting of the members of that coalition of more than 30 countries on Friday  with Zelenskyy also expected to be in attendance.Zelenskyy told reporters in Brussels that a ceasefire was possible in Russia’s war on Ukraine but that yet more pressure would be needed on Moscow to make it happen.He ruled out making any territorial concessions to Russia.,neutral,0.05,0.57,0.38,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'war', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson', 'Populist Prime Minister Robert Fico', 'Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian Foreign Ministry briefing', 'Russian central bank securities', 'Indian oil industry sources', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Danish rotating presidency', 'Euroclear securities depository', 'Russian oil giants', 'Russian oil supplies', 'Russian oil producers', 'oil export restrictions', 'liquefied natural gas', 'European Union leaders', 'high energy prices', 'The US Treasury', 'EU High Representative', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Foreign Affairs', 'new energy sanctions', 'Russian energy', 'Russian banks', 'Russian goals', 'car industry', 'Russian assets', 'European Commission', 'European manufacturers', 'new US', 'The Kremlin', 'US arms', 'new rules', 'future member', 'cash balances', 'funding needs', 'broad support', 'Finnish counterpart', 'Petteri Orpo', 'concrete proposal', 'biggest tranche', 'legal basis', 'Security Policy', 'legal guarantees', 'Al Jazeera', 'Hashem Ahelbarra', 'senior official', 'news agency', 'painful response', 'United States', 'first time', 'White House', 'revenue streams', 'crypto exchanges', 'shadow fleet', 'complete phasing', 'final obstacle', 'close ties', 'US measures', 'root causes', 'Yulia Shapovalova', 'new sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'trade measures', 'EU blacklist', 'EU “elites', 'war goals', '27bn) loan', 'war-torn country', 'Kaja Kallas', '19th package', 'LNG) imports', 'important step', 'political decision', 'loony” Europe', 'EU sanctions', 'Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Moscow', 'Brussels', 'backing', 'Ukraine', '140-billion-euro', 'fury', 'Thursday', 'summit', 'bloc', 'plan', 'Kyiv', 'Belgium', 'doubts', 'legality', 'reporters', 'arrival', 'demands', 'concerns', 'mechanism', 'risks', 'Advertisement', 'countries', 'verge', 'announcement', 'Germans', 'French', 'Italians', 'money', 'weapons', 'administration', 'Reuters', 'funds', 'end', 'year', 'autonomy', 'seizure', 'confiscation', 'boost', 'Wednesday', 'Lukoil', 'Rosneft', 'greenlighting', 'financial', 'entities', 'China', 'others', 'post', 'X.', 'tankers', 'diplomats', 'travel', 'Slovakia', 'deal', 'assurances', 'protections', 'conflict', 'Reporting', 'economy', 'immunity', 'situation', 'continuation', 'instance', 'companies', 'November', 'transactions', 'refiners', 'mas']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,aljazeera.com
53334,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykd4l3dy1o,EU set to endorse deal to turn frozen Russian assets into support for Ukraine,The contentious proposal would see Kyiv receive €140bn (£121bn) worth of frozen Russian state assets currently held in Belgium.,"EU aims to endorse contentious deal to hand Russian assets to Ukraine1 day ago Share Save Laura Gozzi Share SaveReuters The price tag of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery has been put at well above $486bnEuropean leaders aim to endorse controversial plans to use Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday. The unprecedented proposal for what the EU has dubbed a ""reparations loan"" would see Kyiv receive €140bn (£121bn) worth of frozen Russian state assets currently held by Euroclear  a Belgium-based financial institution. The plan has been months in the making  partly due to the legal complexities surrounding it  as well as concerns from member states about upsetting global financial stability. Belgium in particular has been reluctant to back using the frozen assets  as it is nervous about having to shoulder any potential consequences should Russia legally challenge Euroclear. Russia has reacted angrily to any suggestions that the EU could use its money. ""Any confiscatory initiatives from Brussels will inevitably result in a painful response "" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.How would a reparations loan work?For the EU  the problem of how to continue to support Kyiv's struggle against Russian aggression has become more urgent since US support for Ukraine has dwindled. As of July  EU member states have provided about €177.5bn (£154bn) in financial support for Ukraine. But in the absence of any progress towards a ceasefire deal  Ukraine will need more money as Russia's full-scale war approaches its fifth year. The price tag of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery is also estimated by the UN and World Bank to be well above $486bn (£365bn; €420bn). About €210bn (£182bn) in Russian investments was frozen by the EU when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The biggest share – some €185bn – is sitting in Euroclear  a clearing house for financial transactions in Brussels which operates under EU jurisdiction. When they were first frozen  the majority of these Russian investments were in the form of sovereign bonds – a type of loan made to a government which is paid back over a period of time. These bonds have now matured; in other words  Russia is due to get both its initial loan back as well as interest. But because of the sanctions imposed against it in 2022  Moscow cannot access this money. The EU has been using the interest from Russian frozen assets for Ukraine's defence since spring 2024  and that amounts to up to €3bn per year. The EU is now considering redirecting the frozen funds themselves to Ukraine as a zero-interest ""reparations loan"". The much-needed liquidity would be available immediately – on the understanding that Kyiv would repay it through reparations from Moscow once the war ends.Can EU get around legal issues over Russia's cash?International law stipulates that sovereign assets cannot be confiscated outright. Although frozen  these assets remain Moscow's property and seizing them is legally challenging. To get around this issue the EU could ""borrow"" Russia's frozen money held by Euroclear and replace it with an IOU backed by all member states underwriting the debt. This could also offset Euroclear's concerns on how to pay Russia back  should the war end suddenly and Moscow demand its assets back. On Thursday morning Belgium was still expressing criticism of the proposal but leaving the door open to it  if it received guarantees that the risk would be shared by all member states. Prime Minister Bart De Wever said he would do ""everything in his power"" to block the plan if his conditions were not met. EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas told the BBC's Today programme that Belgium's concerns were ""understandable"" and that the Belgians ""should not bear the risk alone"". Russia is furious with the idea of its investments being used. The move would be the ""theft of the century"" and trigger retaliation and damage Western financial stability  Russia's ambassador to Italy Alexey Paramonov said. If EU leaders green-light the reparations at Thursday's summit  the European Commission will begin drawing up the formal legal proposal for the loan.What are the issues?The most glaring issue with the ""reparations loan"" scenario is that it hinges on Ukraine winning the war and Russia accepting to pay damages. There is no guarantee Russia will agree to this. If it doesn't  the EU could forgive Kyiv's debt – but it would still have to repay the money it borrowed to fund the IOU to Euroclear. That burden would effectively fall to European taxpayers – an uncomfortable option for most European governments. There is also concern among Europe's central bankers about potentially setting a difficult legal precedent that could undermine global financial stability - as well as putting off other countries from placing their safe haven assets in the West. Neither Euroclear nor EU countries want to be seen as unreliable depositories of foreign wealth. Even in the context of Russia's war  they need to respect the international monetary order.Who backs the plan  and who doesn't?",neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'deal', 'support', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Belgium-based financial institution', 'global financial stability', 'Western financial stability', 'difficult legal precedent', 'international monetary order', 'most European governments', 'safe haven assets', 'Russian state assets', 'formal legal proposal', 'zero-interest ""reparations loan', 'reparations loan"" scenario', 'Russian frozen assets', 'foreign wealth', 'EU member states', 'financial support', 'financial transactions', 'Russian assets', 'Russian aggression', 'legal complexities', 'International law', 'Russian investments', 'European leaders', 'frozen funds', 'European Commission', 'European taxpayers', 'contentious deal', 'Laura Gozzi', 'price tag', 'controversial plans', 'unprecedented proposal', 'potential consequences', 'confiscatory initiatives', 'painful response', 'US support', 'ceasefire deal', 'World Bank', 'full-scale invasion', 'biggest share', 'clearing house', 'other words', 'initial loan', 'legal issues', 'sovereign assets', 'Alexey Paramonov', 'uncomfortable option', 'central bankers', 'other countries', 'unreliable depositories', 'EU jurisdiction', 'The EU', 'EU leaders', 'EU countries', 'fifth year', 'sovereign bonds', 'glaring issue', 'frozen money', 'Thursday morning', 'full-scale war', 'Ukraine', 'Reuters', 'reconstruction', 'recovery', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'Kyiv', 'Euroclear', 'months', 'making', 'concerns', 'suggestions', 'problem', 'struggle', 'July', 'absence', 'progress', 'Moscow', 'February', 'majority', 'type', 'period', 'time', 'sanctions', 'defence', 'spring', 'liquidity', 'understanding', 'cash', 'property', 'debt', 'criticism', 'door', 'guarantees', 'risk', 'everything', 'power', 'conditions', 'BBC', 'Today', 'programme', 'Belgians', 'idea', 'move', 'theft', 'century', 'retaliation', 'ambassador', 'Italy', 'summit', 'damages', 'burden', 'context']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,bbc.com
53335,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/626881-ukraine-russian-assets-eu/,Ukraine and EU at odds over use of frozen Russian assets – Reuters,Ukraine has urged the European Union to allow flexibility in spending a potential loan backed by frozen Russian assets Read Full Article at RT.com,Kiev is reportedly seeking a flexible use of the funds  while some EU states want spending limited to European-made weaponsUkraine has pushed back against EU plans to impose conditions on a proposed multi-billion-euro loan backed by frozen Russian central-bank assets. Reuters sources indicate that the dispute has exposed divisions within the EU over how the money should be spent.EU officials  who are meeting in Brussels on Thursday  are debating the proposed “reparations loan” worth about €140 billion ($162 billion) for Kiev. The loan would be secured by the Russian assets immobilized by the West after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Under the plan  Kiev would only repay the money if Moscow covers the damages incurred in the conflict. Russia has denounced the proposal as a “theft.”Kiev insists it must be free to decide how it can use the funds. A senior official told Reuters that the money was needed before year-end  and while Kiev supports cooperation with European defense industries  it “would insist on autonomy in deciding how to allocate resources.”Some EU nations are pushing to direct most of the money toward the purchase of European-made weapons  while others urge greater flexibility. The European Commission has reportedly proposed a compromise where most of the funds would go to Ukrainian and EU arms purchases  with a smaller share available for Ukraine’s general budget support  including weapons bought outside the bloc.Bloomberg has reported the US will not join the EU-led initiative  warning that the move could unsettle global markets. Western officials have also cautioned that seizing Russian assets outright – estimated at around $300 billion – would be illegal and undermine the West’s credibility.Belgium  which holds most of the immobilized assets  has voiced concern over risks to Euroclear  the Brussels-based clearinghouse where the funds are kept. Prime Minister Bart De Wever has set three conditions for backing the loan  one of which is that the potential risks be shared  warning that otherwise he would “do everything” to stop the decision.Moscow has condemned the freeze and any attempt to repurpose the funds.

At the same time  countries such as the Netherlands and the Nordic and Baltic states argue that Ukraine should be free to decide how to spend the loan  even on US-made weapons. Despite this  pressure from France and Germany has led summit drafts to emphasize strengthening Europe's defense industry  while critics argue that this stance is hypocritical  the newspaper reported. ""If the aim is to keep Ukraine in the fight  you need to keep the criteria open "" an unnamed senior EU diplomat was quoted as saying. On Thursday  EU leaders are expected to instruct the European Commission at their meeting in Brussels to present a legal proposal outlining the loan. On September 25  the Financial Times newspaper reported that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had proposed that the EU provide Ukraine with an interest-free loan of around 140 billion euros drawn from frozen Russian assets. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever criticized Merz's proposal on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly  saying that an attempt to seize state assets would set a dangerous precedent not only for Belgium but for the EU as a whole. After the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 froze almost half of Russian foreign currency reserves  totaling some 300 billion euros.

53337,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rte.ie/news/europe/2025/1023/1540123-eu-summit/,Dialogue on Russia's frozen assets not simple - Zelensky,Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has outlined three demands for the use of Russian immobilised assets to provide a €140 billion loan to Ukraine  adding that he would oppose the measure until he secures guarantees.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine needs funds from frozen Russian assets at the start of next year and that dialogue on the matter in Brussels today had not been simple.Speaking during a visit to Brussels for talks with European Union leaders  Mr Zelensky also said that land swaps with Russia were ""not acceptable"" and reiterated his position that a ceasefire should precede any talks on a potential solution to end the war.It comes as EU countries formally adopted the 19th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.They include a ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports  said Denmark  which holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.All but one of the member states agreed on the final text last week. Slovakia held out until its demands were met.Its Prime Minister Robert Fico wanted assurances from the European Commission on high energy prices and aligning climate targets with the needs of carmakers and heavy industry.A Slovak diplomat said the demands were met in new clauses added to the final communique for this week's summit in Brussels.We need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

The sanctioned plants account for 3% of China's 19 million bpd refining capacity.The Chinese listings are not the EU's first  but they are the most economically significant. In tandem with Group of Seven nations  the EU is trying to further drain Russia's means to fund its war in Ukraine by squeezing vital oil and gas revenues.The EU also listed China's Tianjin Xishanfusheng International Trading Co  which it said played a significant role in Russia's efforts to circumvent sanctions.""It has exported goods of Union origin to entities in Russia whose direct export from the Union to Russia is prohibited "" it said.Mr Zelensky said the latest sanctions were ""very important"".He added that a ceasefire was possible. However  he said that more pressure would have to be put on Russia to make it happen and ruled out making any territorial concessions to Moscow.EU leaders expected to agree transfer of €140bn in Russian assetsEU leaders were expected to agree in principle to transfer €140 billion in immobilised Russian assets to Ukraine as part of a loan.Under the deal  Ukraine would only repay the loan once Russia makes war reparations.However  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever outlined three demands for the transfer  adding that he would oppose the measure until he secured guarantees.Bart De Wever spoke to reporters as he arrived in Brussels for the summitMr De Wever  whose country is home to chief asset holder Euroclear  said he did not see the legal basis for such a decision  adding that immobilised assets had not even been touched in such a deflagration as World War II.He told reporters  ahead of the European Union summit  that there needs to be full mutualisation of the risk of claims and guarantees that  if the money has to be paid back  then all member states will contribute.Mr De Wever also said that every country that has mobilised assets should move at the same pace.European Council President António Costa said: ""Today we will take the political decision to ensure Ukraine's financial needs for 2026 and 2027.""The technicality of the solutions  we continue to work on with the European Commission  but the most important is the political decision.""Mr Zelensky was welcomed to Brussels by Mr Costa who addressed him as a ""future member of the European Union"".Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Ireland supports the EU's plan to fund Ukraine.He said there would be no implications for neutrality if Ireland acts as a co-guarantor for the loan.

""I'll let you know about it in six months from now. Let's see how it all works out.""The US measures represent a major stepping up of its actions against Russia and reflect Trump's frustration at being unable to persuade Putin to end the conflict despite what he calls his personal chemistry with the Kremlin chief.Zelensky said he hoped Trump's shift on sanctions would also herald a change of mind on giving Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles -- after Kyiv came away from a meeting in Washington empty-handed last week.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementThe EU sanctions package meanwhile saw the bloc bring forward a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas from Russia by a year to the start of 2027  and blacklist more than 100 extra tankers from Moscow's so-called ""shadow fleet"" of ageing oil vessels.bur-ec/ub/rlp",neutral,0.01,0.91,0.07,mixed,0.1,0.25,0.65,True,English,"['small step', 'Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Russian central bank assets', '140-billion-euro ($162-billion) ""reparations loan', 'Russian central bank funds', 'US President Donald Trump', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'international deposit organisation', 'costly legal challenges', 'The US measures', 'long-range Tomahawk missiles', 'liquefied natural gas', 'ageing oil vessels', 'two oil majors', 'frozen Russian assets', 'US oil sanctions', 'leader Vladimir Putin', 'poor little Belgium', 'next two years', 'The Brussels talks', 'Advertisement Advertisement Zelensky', 'EU sanctions package', 'European Commission', 'Russian funds', 'US sanctions', 'European support', '19th package', 'mammoth loan', 'huge loan', 'European diplomat', 'EU leaders', 'marathon talks', 'greenlighting plans', 'crunch decision', 'potential agreement', 'financial needs', 'good note', 'financial resources', 'news conference', '200 billion euros', 'tough work', 'complex proposal', 'summit outcome', 'political support', 'vast majority', 'vocal sceptic', 'EU countries', 'other countries', 'essential problem', 'best option', 'member states', 'closest ally', 'financial support', 'great success', 'compromise wording', 'sensitive matter', 'EU talks', 'White House', 'six months', 'major stepping', '100 extra tankers', 'shadow fleet', 'Judicial questions', 'strong objections', 'risk sharing', 'summit conclusions', '27-nation bloc', 'options', 'funding', 'Ukraine', 'door', 'worded', 'December', 'diplomats', 'text', 'face', 'bulk', '2022 invasion', 'Moscow', 'tanks', 'Kyiv', 'signal', 'notion', 'fight', 'Euroclear', 'concerns', 'demands', 'guarantees', 'territory', 'thing', 'problems', 'solutions', 'reporters', 'exception', 'Hungary', 'place', 'Rosneft', 'Lukoil', 'message', 'country', 'economy', 'response', 'actions', 'frustration', 'conflict', 'Kremlin', 'shift', 'change', 'mind', 'meeting', 'Washington', 'import', 'start', 'rlp']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,yahoo.com
53339,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rte.ie/news/europe/2025/1023/1540089-eu-russia-neutrality/,Neutrality must be acknowledged in Ukraine loan - EU,Senior EU figures have acknowledged that Ireland's neutrality constraints must be taken into account as the European Union edges closer to converting €140 billion in frozen Russian assets into a loan for Ukraine.,"Senior EU figures have acknowledged that Ireland's neutrality constraints must be taken into account as the European Union edges closer to converting €140 billion in frozen Russian assets into a loan for Ukraine.As EU leaders debate the issue at a summit in Brussels  negotiations on how to support Ukraine both financially and militarily in the face of the Russian onslaught are at a delicate stage  particularly over the legal and solidarity implications of utilising Moscow’s frozen assets.Because the bulk of the Russian central bank assets are held in the Belgian securities depository Euroclear  the Belgian government has been adamant that it should not be on the hook alone for the €140bn  should any potential future legal case find in favour of Moscow.Belgium  for legal and financial reasons  had held out against any move to seize assets ever since they were frozen by the EU  G7 and other countries within days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.However  the Belgian government has softened its position in recent months. It is prepared to allow the frozen assets to be converted into a loan for Ukraine  but only on the basis that other EU member states act as co-guarantors.Belgian sources say the country is still seeking clarity on how the solidarity mechanism will work.The problem for the Irish Government is that Ireland - should it agree to join the vast majority of other EU member states and act as a co-guarantor - would be underwriting money that will ultimately be used to support Ukraine militarily.Ukraine argues it should have discretion to use the €140bn for military and civilian supportUntil now  any of Ireland’s contributions to Ukraine have been of a non-lethal nature.Whereas technical methods of getting EU funds to Ukraine through  for example  the so-called European Peace Facility (EPF) - as a way to sidestep Hungary’s continued blocking of support - have been a straightforward issue for Ireland as it has been able to specify that any Irish contributions were non-lethal in nature.However  the use of frozen Russian assets potentially complicates that.The EU’s plan is that €140bn out of a total of up to €200bn in Russian central bank assets held in Euroclear would be given as a loan to Ukraine.Ukraine would repay the loan  but only when Russia begins to pay reparations to Ukraine for its invasion at some theoretical point in the future.Read More:Belgium sets out key demands for use of Russian assets to fund UkraineLatest Ukraine storiesThis manoeuvre gives the EU cover to claim that it is not ""seizing"" the assets  rather using them as a loan.Member states - including Belgium - acknowledge that with the Trump administration phasing out financial support for Ukraine  the country’s financial and military needs are greater than ever.It has been estimated that the cost of reconstruction now stands at $524bn.Ukraine has argued that it should have discretion to use the €140bn both for military support  and to meet some glaring civilian and budgetary needs.Germany and others insist that the money should only be used on weapons to allow Ukraine to defend itself  and to give it a stronger position should peace negotiations materialise.The Irish Government supports a mechanism that would allow the frozen assets to be used both for both military and civilian purposes  precisely because that would allow the state to sidestep any suggestion that it is underwriting the use of frozen Russian assets only for military uses.Senior EU figures have acknowledged the difficulty facing the EU’s four neutral member states - Ireland  Austria  Malta and Cyprus - in joining a guarantee that ultimately will provide Ukraine with badly needed military support.Hungary and Slovakia  which have constantly frustrated the EU’s support for Ukraine  have ruled out acting as co-guarantors.The fewer the member states acting as guarantors  the bigger the risk facing those countries that have agreed to underwrite the €140bn  officials say.For that reason  the European Commission is understood to be anxious to keep neutral countries like Ireland on board and that the process of agreeing will mean catering for countries which have constitutional and political concerns.The Russian Embassy to Ireland warned any utilisation of frozen assets would be regarded as 'grand theft'The Commission is expected to produce a legal text in early November with a view to the Russian assets being converted into a loan for Ukraine by the end of the year.Irish sources have acknowledged there will not be any clarity on the nature of the transaction until the European Commission produces its legal text in early November.In a statement last Thursday  the Russian Embassy to Ireland warned that any utilisation of frozen Russian assets would be regarded as ""grand theft"" and could ultimately lead to the collapse of the European economy.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['Ukraine loan', 'Neutrality', 'four neutral member states', 'Belgian securities depository Euroclear', 'Russian central bank assets', 'potential future legal case', 'other EU member states', 'Senior EU figures', 'The Russian Embassy', 'European Peace Facility', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The Irish Government', 'Latest Ukraine stories', 'other countries', 'Belgian government', 'The Commission', 'Russian onslaught', 'frozen assets', 'Belgian sources', 'neutral countries', 'Irish sources', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'European economy', 'EU leaders', 'EU funds', 'EU cover', 'neutrality constraints', 'delicate stage', 'solidarity implications', 'recent months', 'vast majority', 'technical methods', 'continued blocking', 'theoretical point', 'key demands', 'Trump administration', 'glaring civilian', 'budgetary needs', 'peace negotiations', 'civilian purposes', 'political concerns', 'grand theft', 'legal text', 'early November', 'Irish contributions', 'financial reasons', 'civilian support', 'military needs', 'military uses', 'full-scale invasion', 'solidarity mechanism', 'straightforward issue', 'stronger position', 'financial support', 'military support', 'lethal nature', 'Ireland', 'account', 'loan', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'face', 'Moscow', 'bulk', 'hook', 'favour', 'Belgium', 'move', 'G7', 'days', 'February', 'basis', 'guarantors', 'country', 'clarity', 'problem', 'money', 'discretion', 'example', 'EPF', 'way', 'Hungary', 'plan', 'total', 'reparations', 'manoeuvre', 'cost', 'reconstruction', 'Germany', 'others', 'weapons', 'suggestion', 'difficulty', 'Austria', 'Malta', 'Cyprus', 'guarantee', 'Slovakia', 'risk', 'officials', 'board', 'process', 'constitutional', 'utilisation', 'view', 'end', 'year', 'transaction', 'statement', 'collapse', '€']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,rte.ie

Meanwhile  Poland and Baltic states aggressively support confiscation.Putin has framed the seizure as economic warfare  hinting at asymmetric retaliation – including potential nuclear strikes on Western financial hubs – while BRICS nations accelerate de-dollarization (yuan  ruble trade deals).The West's move exposes its double standards: NATO's eastward expansion violated past assurances to Russia  and Israel's actions in Gaza face no asset freezes  eroding faith in the ""rules-based order.""Similar post-World War I reparations triggered hyperinflation and fascism in Germany. Now  weaponizing finance risks accelerating the dollar's demise  as nations flee to alternative currencies and Russia escalates militarily.In a brazen move that could destabilize global markets and provoke retaliatory nuclear threats  Western nations led by the European Union are advancing plans to permanently confiscate $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's war effort.The controversial scheme  debated this week among the Group of Seven (G7) leaders  has already drawn sharp condemnation from Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that such a proposal would ""fundamentally undermine all principles of international economic activity."" Meanwhile  the U.S. has reportedly distanced itself from the EU-led plan  fearing catastrophic repercussions for the dollar-dominated financial system.Since Russia's special military operation in Ukraine began in February 2022  Western powers have immobilized an estimated $300 billion in Russian sovereign funds – with €200 billion ($231.72 billion) held in Belgium's Euroclear clearinghouse. While these assets have already been leveraged to generate billions in interest payments for Kyiv  EU leaders including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron now seek to escalate the financial war by outright seizing the principal.A proposed €140 billion ""reparations loan"" put forward by Merz would effectively transfer ownership of the funds to Ukraine  with repayment contingent on Russia's future surrender – a condition Moscow has dismissed as ""theft."" The plan  however  faces internal resistance.Belgium  home to the bulk of the frozen assets  fears being left holding the bag if legal challenges arise. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has demanded risk-sharing among all EU members  while European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warns the seizure could ""undermine global trust"" in the eurozone.Even within the G7  divisions are stark. Poland and the Baltic states champion confiscation  while Washington has quietly backed away. Bloomberg reported that American officials privately cautioned allies about ""risks to market stability.""Stealing Russia's money could accelerate the West's collapseThe geopolitical stakes could not be higher. Putin has repeatedly framed asset seizures as an act of economic warfare  hinting at asymmetric retaliation – potentially including nuclear strikes on Western financial hubs.Meanwhile  BrightU.AI's Enoch engine warns that ""seizing Russia's $300 billion in assets risks provoking severe retaliation – including economic warfare  cyberattacks or even military escalation – as Moscow views this theft as an existential betrayal by immoral Western powers. The West's blatant looting could destabilize global security and trigger unpredictable consequences  reinforcing Russia's resolve to resist and retaliate against perceived theft and aggression.""While some dismiss such threats as posturing  the precedent of Western nations rewriting financial rules mid-conflict has already accelerated the global flight from dollar reserves. BRICS nations  led by China  are fast-tracking alternative trade currencies – with the yuan and ruble gaining ground in bilateral deals.Historically  such unilateral asset seizures are rare outside wartime reparations – and even then  they've often backfired. After World War I  the crushing reparations imposed on Germany fueled hyperinflation and the rise of fascism.Today  the West risks triggering a similar spiral. By weaponizing finance  it invites retaliatory de-dollarization  leaving the Federal Reserve unable to export inflation or sustain its debt bubble.Worse still  the move exposes the hypocrisy of Western ""rules-based order"" rhetoric. While Russia's invasion is condemned as a breach of international law  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion – violating assurances made to Moscow in the 1990s – goes unpunished. Similarly  Israel's bombardment of Gaza has not resulted in frozen Israeli assets  revealing a double standard that erodes global trust.As EU leaders meet this week to finalize their plan  the world watches nervously.

They may use frozen Russian assets to secure a massive loan for Kyiv. This move aims to ensure continued financial and military aid as United States support wavers. The proposal faces significa…,"Live Eventsas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channelThe European Union is racing to come up with a plan to keep money and weapons flowing to Ukraine at a moment when support from the United States is uncertain and Ukraine's needs are gaping.Meeting in Brussels on Thursday  leaders from the bloc's 27 member nations could move forward with a novel  risky idea that centers on Russia 's assets that have been frozen since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The European Commission   the EU executive arm  has circulated a rough plan to use that immobilized money to back a 140 billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine. On Thursday  the political leaders will decide whether the commission should make a formal proposal to do so  though hammering out the final details and reaching agreement could take months.""We will take the political decision to ensure the financial needs of Ukraine for 2026 and 2027  including for acquisition of military equipment "" António Costa  the president of the European Council  predicted Thursday morning  speaking on the sidelines of the meeting. The Council sets the political direction for the EU.If they decide to pursue the frozen assets plan  it would mark a first step toward making what European leaders call a ""reparations loan"" -- a political green light for an idea that has big potential to help Ukraine as U.S. aid dwindles.But there are big risks: Russian retaliation and damage to Europe 's reputation as a safe haven for foreign assets.Here's what to know.A big chunk of the Russian government's frozen assets sits in Euroclear  a financial institution in Belgium. Europe already funnels to Ukraine the interest earned on those deposits  about $8 billion last year.Under the new plan  Euroclear would essentially hand control of Russia's frozen funds to the EU  which would use the money to back the giant loan to Ukraine. Ukraine would need to repay the money only if it received reparations from Russia.The move is a political and financial gamble. One major question is how the Kremlin would react.The EU contends that the setup is legal because the money would be borrowed  not confiscated  so Russia could  at some point in the future  get it back. But a Kremlin spokesperson said recently  ""we are talking about theft "" and Russia warned that it could prosecute individuals and countries involved.As the home of Euroclear  Belgium fears it would bear the brunt of any legal or financial fallout  and has been adamant that the risks need to be shared across Europe.Critics of the plan have also warned that using Russia's assets could make other nations  like China and India  nervous about stashing their savings in European banks  worried that their own assets could be frozen and lent out if they end up on Europe's bad side.European Commission officials say those fears are unfounded.""If you don't start a war against another country  then your assets are not at risk "" Kaja Kallas  the top EU diplomat  told reporters on a recent trip to Kyiv  the Ukrainian capital  where she and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine discussed his country's pressing budget needs.As they downplay any risks  officials have also emphasized why they consider the plan necessary. As the war drags on  Ukraine faces not only huge ongoing costs but also a substantial budget deficit.A major problem is that U.S. support has dried up. From 2022 to late 2024  under the Biden administration  Congress appropriated about $174 billion in funding for Ukraine. But under President Donald Trump  U.S. military aid to Ukraine has fallen sharply this year  according to the Kiel Institute think tank  and in recent months has been all but nonexistent.European nations have given heavily to Ukraine  but in light of their own budget constraints  it is difficult for them to fill the gap as the U.S. steps back.A loan backed by frozen Russian assets could theoretically make up the difference. But because key details have yet to be decided  it is not clear whether it will exactly match Ukraine's needs or plug the holes left by the United States.It has yet to be decided exactly how Ukraine would be able to use the loan.Some nations  most notably Germany  have suggested that the money should be dedicated to procuring weapons. But Zelenskyy himself has suggested that it should also be available for other budgetary needs.And other practical details remain unresolved.European nations could provide loan guarantees to put Belgium at ease  but it is not clear how those guarantees would be structured. Would all 27 EU nations have skin in the game? Would the guarantees involve any actual collateral?Belgium wants the broader Group of 7 major industrialized nations to also support the plan  but it is not clear whether Washington will agree.Finally  the EU executive must have a legal plan to ensure that the assets remain frozen for a long time. If the freeze needs to be renewed regularly  as is currently the case  a more Russia-friendly nation like Hungary could throw the loan into chaos by refusing to keep the funds immobilized.With such substantial questions lingering  a decision Thursday would only kick off the process.

He also warned against the seizure of assets of European companies in Russia.According to initial plans  Russia would only get the money back if it pays reparations after the end of the war against Ukraine.In case the frozen Russian funds have to be unexpectedly released  EU countries would provide guarantees according to Merz's plans.So far only the interest on the frozen money is being used to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia.EU under pressure to provide more support to UkraineEuropean Council President António Costa  who chairs Thursday's talks  said he expects a decision by EU leaders.""We will take the political decision to ensure the financial needs of Ukraine for 2026 and 2027  including for acquisition of military equipment."" he said.""This is a very strong message to Russia. We said repeatedly that we will support Ukraine as long as necessary and whatever it takes.""The EU has been one of Ukraine's biggest supporters since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine with financial and military assistance totalling close to €180 billion.The bloc has been under increasing pressure to provide additional aid to Kiev after US support has dwindled under President Donald Trump.Many EU countries however are faced with bleak domestic economic outlooks  rising deficits and heavy debt burdens  prompting the move to potentially tap into Russia's immobilized state assets.""When we talk about frozen Russian assets  we must use them in a way that makes Russia understand: It is paying for its own war "" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  who attended the EU summit a a guest.""I ask you to make a decision as soon as possible: Russian assets should be fully used to defend against Russian aggression "" he added.Merz hopes for ""jointsolution"" despite Belgian concernsMerz voiced optimism that plans to turn the assets into loans for Kiev will be backed by his EU counterparts despite resistance from Belgium.""I am grateful that my proposal has been met with broad approval "" Merz said as he arrived at the Brussels meeting.""There are however a few serious objections that we need to discuss. This concerns in particular the Belgian state and its liability "" he added.Merz said he has spoken to Belgium's De Wever ""several times in recent days and weeks.""""I share his concerns  but he is interested in finding a joint solution  and I therefore expect us to make progress today.""On Wednesday  EU countries already backed new sanctions on Russia  including a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia.Other topics on the summit agenda include defence  after the commission proposed four rearmament projects last week - in the areas of border protection  drone defence  air defence and space - to strengthen Europe's military capabilities and deter Russia.Leaders are also expected to address the bloc's yet-to-be decided emissions reduction target for 2040 and the economic implications of fighting climate change  with EU countries struggling to agree on new reduction commitments.Additional topics on the table are recent developments in the Middle East and the ceasefire between the Palestinian militant organization Hamas and Israel  migration to the EU and affordable housing.",negative,0.0,0.44,0.56,mixed,0.24,0.29,0.47,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Belgium', 'plans', 'Kiev', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'President António Costa', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'bleak domestic economic outlooks', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'available Russian state assets', 'President Donald Trump', 'heavy debt burdens', 'liquefied natural gas', 'four rearmament projects', 'emissions reduction target', 'Palestinian militant organization', 'new reduction commitments', 'Belgian financial institution', 'Many EU countries', 'Belgian concerns Merz', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The European Commission', 'other EU leaders', 'Belgian state', 'Belgian politician', 'economic implications', 'other countries', 'member state', 'Russian funds', 'Russian aggression', 'new sanctions', 'Other topics', 'European Union', 'European companies', 'European Council', 'key player', 'large portion', 'full mutualization', 'joint action', 'financial needs', 'military equipment', 'strong message', 'biggest supporters', 'full-scale invasion', 'military assistance', 'additional aid', 'rising deficits', 'broad approval', 'serious objections', 'recent days', 'joint solution', 'summit agenda', 'border protection', 'military capabilities', 'climate change', 'Additional topics', 'recent developments', 'Middle East', 'affordable housing', 'EU summit', 'EU counterparts', 'frozen money', 'crunch talks', 'big risk', 'increasing pressure', 'US support', 'Brussels meeting', 'drone defence', 'air defence', 'initial plans', 'political decision', 'Belgium', 'Thursday', 'Ukraine', 'demands', 'everything', 'power', 'issue', 'Euroclear', 'loans', 'proposal', 'bill', 'guarantees', 'transparency', 'seizure', 'reparations', 'war', 'case', 'interest', 'acquisition', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'move', 'way', 'guest', 'jointsolution', 'optimism', 'resistance', 'liability', 'weeks', 'progress', 'Wednesday', 'ban', 'import', 'LNG', 'areas', 'space', 'table', 'ceasefire', 'Hamas', 'Israel', 'migration', '2040']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,dpa-international.com

Ad DisclosureQuick Facts: 1️⃣ Over $8.3B in real-world assets are already tokenized on-chain and growing fast.2️⃣ Banks like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are integrating blockchain custody for Treasuries and money-market funds.3️⃣ $HYPER  $BEST  and $LINK are well-positioned to benefit from the next phase of tokenization.4️⃣ The shift from DeFi vs. TradFi to DeFi + TradFi marks a new era in digital finance.Crypto’s been around for nearly two decades  and in that time  we’ve seen narratives change.Way back in the beginning  DeFi (decentralized finance) and TradFi (traditional finance) were supposed to be competitors.DeFi would grow and develop into a rival financial system  providing all the advantages that TradFi lacked: transparency  accountability on the blockchain  natively-digital assets  and more.That’s not what we see today. Instead  TradFi looked around  saw DeFi – and liked what it saw.Now  big banks and financial institutions are adopting crypto left  right  and center – and tokenized assets lead the way  particularly tokenized US treasuries  long since a favorite tool of the financial system.According to recent figures  approximately $8.3B in Treasuries have already been tokenized on-chain  with broader estimates putting the total closer to $24-30B.For years  institutions such as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon shunned crypto custody  citing regulatory and accounting burdens. Today  they are tokenizing money-market funds  short-term government debt and other liquid assets that naturally fit the blockchain model.The logic is operational rather than speculative: tokenized funds enable corporate treasurers to move cash faster  pledge assets more flexibly and settle trades outside the usual cut-off times.If you’re a large  multi-national corporation moving large volumes of cash and securities  those benefits are highly appealing.But tokenization requires custody – holding both the underlying assets (the treasuries themselves  for instance) and the resulting tokens. That’s where the story gets interesting  as the race for custody heats up.Crypto-native firms like Coinbase  with $246B in assets under custody   and Fidelity Investments currently dominate crypto asset custody  charging fees in the order of 0.05 %-0.15% of asset value.As tokenized assets scale  those fee revenues add up; if tokenized cash and Treasuries continue to grow from $8B now to reach $25-40B  annual revenues of $300-600M would flow into crypto custodians.Coinbase has the crypto knowledge and infrastructure  but banks already have the client base  trust relationships and regulatory permissions to hold large balance sheets. If they can integrate tokenization into existing custody services  they could capture a major part of that value chain.Tokenization is growing at a phenomenal rate. In 2024 alone:Total market cap of tokenized assets increased by 32%Tokenized treasuries surged by 179%Private credit grew 40%Commodities increased 5%Each of those categories is expected to report even greater growth in 2025.As tokenization booms and banks turn their eyes towards crypto  what are the best crypto to buy now? Look for $HYPER  $BEST  and $LINK to potentially grow by 10x or more as tokenization takes root.1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Canonical Bridge to Bitcoin’s Layer-2 Next ChapterBitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) serves as a next-generation Layer-2 scaling solution that merges the security of Bitcoin with the high-speed architecture of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).Designed with a Canonical Bridge  it enables $BTC to be wrapped  staked  and transacted on a high-throughput Layer 2  allowing near-instant payments  DeFi integration  and complex smart contracts.What is $HYPER?

Chainlink ($LINK) – Oracles that Power DeFi and TradFi AdoptionChainlink ($LINK) is rapidly transitioning from being a leading blockchain oracle network to a pivotal bridge between legacy finance and decentralized systems:Chainlink collaborated with SWIFT to allow banks to continue using ISO 20022 message formats  while triggering on-chain events via Chainlink’s architecture  meaning institutions can keep familiar processes and rails while adopting tokenized finance.Chainlink also introduced the ‘Digital Transfer Agent’ (DTA) technical standard  which enables fund administrators and custodians to manage tokenized fund subscriptions and redemptions in the same way they do today — but now on-chain.A major initiative with 24 global financial institutions  including DTCC and Euroclear  aims to standardize corporate-actions data on-chain and streamline asset-servicing operations.Chainlink explicitly links their own development to asset tokenization. At a recent conference  founder Sergey Nazarov demonstrated just how big the potential market is:Markets worth hundreds of trillions are all in play – and Chainlink intends to open them all to crypto.What’s happening with TradFi and DeFi may appear incremental. Tokenizing money-market funds isn’t flashy. But the underlying implication is profound: banks are positioning to become the custodians and operational backbone of the next generation of digital finance.The flows of tokenized assets – not just the headline amounts – will determine who controls balance sheets of the future  and $BEST  $LINK  and $HYPER are all poised to play active roles.As always  do your own research.

We are militarily neutral ” he said.About €180 billion of Russian central bank assets  frozen in Europe by economic sanctions  would be used to finance the loan to Ukraine  with the money only repaid to Russia if Moscow agreed to compensate Kyiv for the destruction its war has caused.The plan was discussed at a summit of the EU’s 27 leaders in Brussels on Thursday  where there was a push to get high-level political backing for work on the loan scheme to continue.The sanctioned Russian assets  originally central bank bonds that have matured into cash  were immobilised in Euroclear  a Belgian securities depository  when Russia invaded Ukraine more than three and a half years ago.Under the plan  EU states would have to provide guarantees to jointly cover the loan  in the event repayment was triggered without Russia paying reparations to Ukraine  for example if support to maintain Europe’s regime of sanctions on Russia collapsed.[ EU leaders to seek guarantees on €140bn plan to use Russian frozen assets for UkraineOpens in new window ]One source estimated Ireland’s share of the worst-case scenario financial guarantees could amount to several billion euros.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPASpeaking in Brussels  Mr Martin said it was too early to put a figure on any amount the State would have to backstop. “There’s a journey to go here yet ” the Fianna Fáil leader said. “There is a lot of detail involved in this and a lot of clarity required ” he said.The European Commission  the EU’s executive arm that has proposed the convoluted loan  plans to set out the technical details in a legal text in early November.The loan will have to be designed in such a way that the EU can argue it has not confiscated the Russian state assets. This means the Russian cash will essentially be replaced by an IOU from the EU  with repayment conditional on Russia financing the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.The commission is confident it can address concerns raised by the European Central Bank and sceptical member states  such as Belgium who fear they could be on the hook if things go wrong given the assets are frozen in their jurisdiction.EU officials believe the loan would go a long way to helping Ukraine meet the costs of its defensive war for the next two years.It is understood the commission wants to ensure not all of the loan would be used to buy weapons  so that neutral countries  such as Ireland  could support the proposal.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said Ireland would need some assurances that the proposed Ukraine loan would allow for “recognition of our neutrality”.“That has been recognised in all of the different funding arrangements that have been in place so far and I’m very confident that this issue is fully understood ” he said.Mr Donohoe said it was not clear yet whether Dáil approval would be needed for any guarantee.“If this issue of support does require a national guarantee  the challenge that we will face in Ireland will be the same that many other countries will face in bringing forward legislation  if it is needed ” he said.The Taoiseach said Ireland was not a “safe haven” that was immune to the growing threat Russia posed to Europe. That included the possible targeting of the State’s “economic infrastructure”  namely subsea data cables running from Ireland and Europe to the US.Mr Martin said the Government was interested in aspects of European plans to build up defences that could detect  jam or shoot down malicious drones. The so-called “drone wall” plan has picked up pace after recent instances of interference linked to Russia.“Drones will have multiple applications in use  protecting vital infrastructure  protecting our coastline…So this drone initiative is something that we would want to participate in and learn from ” Mr Martin said.[ EU members ‘need to step up’ financial aid to UkraineOpens in new window ],neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.12,0.25,0.64,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Ukraine loan', 'Ireland', 'plan', 'Fianna Fáil leader', 'Taoiseach Micheál Martin', 'worst-case scenario financial guarantees', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank bonds', 'Dáil approval', 'European Central Bank', 'high-level political backing', 'Belgian securities depository', 'next two years', 'different funding arrangements', 'several billion euros', 'sceptical member states', 'many other countries', 'Taoiseach Michael Martin', 'European Union initiative', 'growing threat Russia', 'European Union plan', 'The European Commission', 'Russian state assets', 'Russian state cash', 'The Taoiseach', 'financial aid', 'European plans', 'Russian assets', 'neutral countries', 'drone initiative', 'Mr Martin', 'Russian cash', 'Ukrainian president', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'economic cost', 'EU states', 'new window', 'One source', 'Olivier Matthys/EPA', 'executive arm', 'technical details', 'legal text', 'early November', 'Paschal Donohoe', 'Mr Donohoe', 'safe haven', 'possible targeting', 'economic infrastructure', 'data cables', 'drone wall', 'recent instances', 'multiple applications', 'vital infrastructure', '€140 billion loan', 'previous event', 'economic sanctions', '€140bn plan', 'EU officials', 'national guarantee', 'malicious drones', 'EU members', 'loan scheme', 'convoluted loan', 'long way', 'defensive war', 'EU leaders', 'Ukraine loan', '27 leaders', 'hands', 'implications', 'neutrality', 'Photograph', 'Getty', 'Ireland', 'efforts', 'battlefield', 'decision', 'money', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'destruction', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'push', 'work', 'Euroclear', 'repayment', 'reparations', 'example', 'support', 'regime', 'UkraineOpens', 'share', 'figure', 'amount', 'journey', 'lot', 'clarity', 'reconstruction', 'concerns', 'Belgium', 'hook', 'things', 'jurisdiction', 'costs', 'weapons', 'proposal', 'Minister', 'Finance', 'assurances', 'recognition', 'place', 'issue', 'challenge', 'legislation', 'Government', 'aspects', 'defences', 'pace', 'interference', 'use', 'coastline', 'something']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,irishtimes.com

We will not relent until the people of Ukraine have a just and lasting peace.”The EU has agreed to a phased ban of Russian liquefied natural gas imports  with the goal of stopping all trade in Russian shipped gas by January 1st 2027. Europe bought a record amount of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2024  after pipeline gas supplies plummeted  a trade that benefited Russia and undermined the EU’s support for Ukraine.The EU added 117 shadow fleet vessels to its sanctions list  meaning 558 boats suspected of illegal shipments of Russian oil are unable to access EU ports or insurance services.Russia is estimated to have 600 to 1 400 unregulated tankers in its “shadow fleet”  ageing vessels under opaque ownership structures  which are used to ship oil at prices exceeding the western price cap to countries such as China and India. The G7 imposed a price cap on Russian oil in December 2022 to squeeze Russian revenues being used to fund the invasion. Ukraine’s European allies reduced the price cap further in September.In another move  Russian diplomats based in the EU will no longer be able to freely travel throughout the bloc and must notify national authorities of their intention to travel to another EU member state.Denmark’s foreign minister  Lars Lokke Rasmussen  said the ban on LNG imports was an important step towards completely phasing out Russian energy in the EU. “The sanctions have real impact and are hurting the Russian economy. Russia is finding it increasingly difficult to finance its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.”Approval came after Slovakia lifted its veto and Washington imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies  Rosneft and Lukoil  the first US measures against Vladimir Putin’s war machine since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.In a possible sign of warmer relations between Brussels and the Trump administration  Ms von der Leyen said she appreciated a call with the US treasury secretary  Scott Bessent  about the US sanctions. “This is a clear signal from both sides ” she wrote once it was clear the EU measures would also be approved.EU leaders will offer a show of support to Ukraine’s president  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  who will join the summit on Thursday  after a rocky week that included a tense meeting with Trump who reportedly sought to browbeat Ukraine’s leader into giving up territory.A plan to approve a multi-billion-euro loan for Ukraine secured on Russia’s frozen assets in the EU remains has been held up over Belgium’s concerns. Belgium hosts €183 billion of frozen Russian assets at Euroclear  a central securities depository in Brussels  but is worried about a plan to lend Ukraine €140 billion based on these funds.Arriving at the summit on Thursday  Belgium’s prime minister  Bart De Wever  said he would oppose the plan without relevant guarantees. “I have not even seen the legal basis for the decision yet ” Mr De Wever told reporters. “Even during the second World War immobilised assets were never touched.

Europe’s biggest conflict since 1945 feels a lot closer and Zelenskiy’s message packs more of a punch.He joined leaders again on Thursday  sitting in on the portion of the EU summit that discussed the Ukraine war. Upon arrival Zelenskiy did a lap of the table  embracing each of the leaders before taking a seat.The Ukrainian president has looked a tired figure on some of his recent visits to Brussels  but this time he had cause to smile  and crack the odd joke. The day started with news that the EU and the US had approved new sanctions  limiting Russia’s ability to sell its oil and gas.US president Donald Trump  who has alternated between blaming Russia and Ukraine for holding up a peace deal he desperately wants to broker  sanctioned two of Russia’s largest oil companies  the first US sanctions on Moscow since Trump’s return to the White House.Coming on the back of Trump’s decision to abandon a plan to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest  the sanctions are a boost to Kyiv.In Brussels diplomats struck a deal on a fresh round of EU sanctions  which include a ban on future imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG). Late-night talks on the eve of the EU summit saw Slovakia lift its opposition  allowing the sanctions to be approved.Speaking after he left EU leaders  Zelenskiy said European friends were “real friends”  who had stood by Kyiv since the beginning of the war.Trump’s hot and cold approach has left Europe shouldering the financial burden of supporting Ukraine on the battlefield.Military aid from Washington has dried up. The Trump administration is happy to keep supplying weapons to Kyiv  on the condition Ukraine  EU states or other Nato members pay for them.The Ukrainians are likely to run low on funds in the second half of next year and Zelenskiy will first look to his allies in Europe for help.Big contributors  such as Denmark  the Netherlands and other Nordic states  feel others are not pulling their weight.Earlier this year Kaja Kallas  the EU’s top representative on foreign affairs  proposed tying contributions to countries’ economic heft  meaning France  Italy  Spain and Ireland would have had to cough up a lot more money for Ukraine. Capitals were not fans of the idea and the plan fell flat.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and European Council President Antonio Costa arrive for an EU Summit at the European Council building in Brussels (Harry Nakos/AP)António Costa  the European Council president who chairs the summits  said Europe would do “whatever it takes” to support Kyiv as the war heads towards its fifth year.National budgets are under the cosh and the EU knows it won’t find tens of billions of euro down the back of the couch.Hence  a legally creative plan to make use of Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe.The idea is to tap that cash to extend a €140 billion loan to Ukraine  filling up its financial war chest for at least two years. The money would only be repaid to Russia if Moscow compensates Kyiv for the destruction its invasion has caused.“We need it in 2026 and better to have it at the very beginning of the year  but I don’t know if it is possible ” Zelenskiy said of the proposed loan.The sanctioned Russian assets were frozen in Euroclear  a Belgian securities depository  after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.Belgium needs solid assurances any legal risk will be shared by all EU states. “If we want to do this  we will have to do this all together ” Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever said.“We want guarantees if the money has to be paid back  that every member state will chip in  the consequences cannot only be for Belgium ” he said.The Ukraine war was far from the only item on the summit agenda. For the first time the European Council meeting discussed housing  a topic where the EU has traditionally played no role.Leaders were also discussing pressure the bloc was under to meet 2040 climate targets  a push to cut back Brussels’ rules and regulations  migration policy and plans to boost the union’s defence industry.,positive,0.94,0.06,0.0,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['European friends', 'real friends', 'good day', 'Zelenskiy', 'Brussels', 'Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Russian liquefied natural gas', 'European Union (EU) leaders’ summits', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Belgian securities depository', 'European Council building', 'António Costa', 'European Council meeting', 'other Nato members', 'countries’ economic heft', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'other Nordic states', 'The Ukrainian president', 'wartime Ukrainian leader', 'largest oil companies', 'financial war chest', 'The Trump administration', 'first US sanctions', 'Russian assets', 'Russian leader', 'European friends', 'financial burden', 'first time', 'EU states', 'The Ukrainians', 'regular feature', 'different feeling', 'closed-door discussions', 'biggest conflict', 'message packs', 'tired figure', 'recent visits', 'odd joke', 'White House', 'Vladimir Putin', 'fresh round', 'future imports', 'Late-night talks', 'real friends', 'cold approach', 'Military aid', 'second half', 'Big contributors', 'Kaja Kallas', 'top representative', 'foreign affairs', 'Harry Nakos/AP', 'National budgets', 'two years', 'solid assurances', 'legal risk', 'member state', 'summit agenda', '2040 climate targets', 'migration policy', 'defence industry', 'EU summit', 'EU leaders', 'new sanctions', 'EU sanctions', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'next year', 'fifth year', 'peace deal', '€140 billion loan', 'creative plan', 'Brussels’ rules', 'Ukraine war', 'person', 'invitation', 'Kyiv', 'room', 'punch', 'Thursday', 'portion', 'arrival', 'lap', 'table', 'seat', 'cause', 'news', 'ability', 'Moscow', 'return', 'back', 'decision', 'Budapest', 'boost', 'diplomats', 'LNG', 'Slovakia', 'opposition', 'beginning', 'hot', 'battlefield', 'Washington', 'weapons', 'condition', 'funds', 'allies', 'help', 'Denmark', 'Netherlands', 'others', 'weight', 'contributions', 'France', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Ireland', 'money', 'Capitals', 'fans', 'idea', 'cosh', 'tens', 'billions', 'couch', 'cash', 'destruction', 'invasion', 'Euroclear', 'February', 'Belgium', 'guarantees', 'consequences', 'item', 'housing', 'topic', 'role', 'pressure', 'bloc', 'push', 'regulations', 'plans']",2025-10-23,2025-10-24,irishtimes.com

This operation is the largest acquisition undertaken since 2018.The appointment of Jean Laurent Poitou as Chief Executive Officer.Significant progress in developing Ipsos’ strategy for the coming years.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTERIn €m 2025revenue Totalgrowth Of which:organicscopecurrency 1st quarter 568.5 2.0% -1.8% 2.9% 0.9% 2nd quarter 586.6 1.0% 0.7% 3.3% -3.0% 3rd quarter 635.9 7.6% 2.9% 8.5% -3.8% Revenue 1 791.0 3.6% 0.7% 4.9% -2.0%PERFORMANCE BY REGIONIn €m 9 monthsrevenue Totalgrowth Organic growth Of which:Q1Q2Q3 EMEA 872.8 10.0% 1.6% -0.3% 1.8% 3.2% Americas 630.3 -1.3% 1.2% -1.7% 0.6% 4.3% Asia-Pacific 287.9 -3.3% -3.0% -6.0% -2.3% -1.0% Total 1 791.0 3.6% 0.7% -1.8% 0.7% 2.9%The Group’s performance improved across all geographies in the third quarter.In EMEA  total growth in our activities reaches 10% at the end of September  mainly driven by our recent acquisitions. Organic growth stands at 1.6% at the end of September  including 3.2% in the third quarter alone. While satisfactory in continental Europe and the Middle East  it is partly impacted by a roughly 4% decline in France  where the political climate has weighed heavily on our Public Affairs activity. Organic growth in France is slightly positive among private-sector clients.The Americas region posted organic growth of 1.2% since the beginning of the year and 4.3% in the third quarter alone. In the United States  activity excluding Public Affairs is recovering  with organic growth of around 3% over the first nine months of the year  supported by an improvement in the healthcare sector and by the good performance related to consumer goods clients. That said  the political environment continues to weigh heavily on our Public Affairs activity  which is down about 15% since the start of the year.In Asia-Pacific  China records a slight growth. The region’s performance is impacted by the decline in our Public Affairs activity in several countries  including Australia  New Zealand and India.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn €m 9 monthsrevenue Totalgrowth Organic growth Of which:Q1Q2Q3 Consumers1 881.5 2.8% 2.0% -0.6% 1.6% 4.9% Clients & Employees2 360.0 3.5% 2.0% 0.5% 2.7% 2.9% Citizens3 285.3 5.1% -9.2% -14.2% -8.7% -4.7% Doctors & Patients4 264.1 4.4% 5.0% 5.4% 5.2% 4.4% Total 1 791.0 3.6% 0.7% -1.8% 0.7% 2.9%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Ipsos Synthesio  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media Development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our service lines dedicated to consumers  clients and employees posted organic growth of 2% over the first nine months of the year. This increase is notably driven by the good performance of our activities related to advertising campaign measurement  marketing spends optimization and mystery shopping studies.Activity related to citizens shows an organic decline of 9.2% since the start of the year. It continues to be weighed down by political uncertainty and the prolonged wait-and-see attitude of public-sector clients  particularly in the United States  France  and several Asian countries.The doctors & patients audience confirms its recovery and records organic growth of 5% over the first nine months of the year. This positive momentum is notably driven by innovation across several therapeutic areas  despite uncertainties over drug pricing in the United States and longer FDA approval timelines.Our Ipsos.Digital platform continues its rapid development and has recorded 28% growth since the start of the year  particularly in product testing and advertising campaign measurement  with an operating margin roughly twice that of the Group.PERSPECTIVESAt the close of the first nine months of the year  the Group posted a good performance among private-sector clients.Budgetary constraints on governments and political instability in many countries are weighing on public spending and leading to delays in order intake. Therefore  Ipsos revises its 2025 annual organic growth target to around 0.7%.The operating margin target of around 13% at constant scope is confirmed and reflects the Group’s ability to demonstrate good operational discipline. It excludes the transitory dilutive effect linked to the acquisitions of The BVA Family and infas  estimated at 60 basis points for 2025.Ipsos has many strengths:The position of an independent and diversified global leader across both geographies and expertisesDifferentiated offerings built on an unrivalled wealth of historical data  enabling the calibration and validation of AI‑based models and ensuring  thanks to proprietary panels and access to real people  that these models do not driftLong‑term relationships with its clientsTalented teamsA sound financial profile that provides the Group the means to act.However  organic growth remains below ambitions  and the Group’s priority is to accelerate organic growth. In a rapidly evolving market  Ipsos is confident in its ability to transform by judiciously leveraging technology and AI  while preserving what has made it successful.By agreement between the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer  the presentation of the new strategy Horizons 2030 is postponed from 19 November 2025 to 22 January 2026.ABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research companies in the world  present in 90 markets and employing nearly 20 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  clients and employees.

At constant exchange rates (CER)1  sales fell by 3.1%  incorporating a negative foreign exchange effect of €14.6 million  mainly due to the depreciation of the currencies of Latin America and Asia. At CER and on a like-for-like basis2  sales decreased by 2.8%.This reflects a steady sequential improvement throughout the year: after falling by 7.1% in the first quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter  Guerbet saw a resumption of growth in the third quarter to +2.6% at CER and on a like-for-like basis. This acceleration  which is in line with the Group’s forecast  is expected to continue in the fourth quarter of 2025.Q3 9 months In millions of euros 20242025% chg. % chg.at CER 20242025% chg. % chg.at CER EMEA sales 78.2 86.2 +10.2% +10.2% 261.4 255.8 -2.2% -2.3% Americas sales 65.8 58.8 -10.7% -5.7% 190.4 176.5 -7.3% -2.2% Asia sales 56.2 53.7 -4.4% +1.5% 164.6 152.4 -7.5% -4.3% Total like-for-like 200.2 198.7 -0.7% +2.6% 616.5 584.7 -5.2% -2.8% Divested businesses* 1.2 0.0 - - 4.0 1.8 - - Total 201.3 198.7 -1.3% +2.0% 620.5 586.5 -5.5% -3.1%*Divested businesses: Accurate and urologyIn the EMEA region  revenue came to €255.8 million at September 30  2025  down 2.3% at CER and on a like-for-like basis. These first nine months were negatively affected by sales in France and difficulty in winning back the market share lost during the switch from single dose to larger vials  following the supply chain reform. In the third quarter alone  revenue rose by 10.2% at CER and on a like-for-like basis (+25.7% excluding France)  benefiting from the performance of indirect sales (distributors).In the Americas  revenue came to €176.5 million at September 30  2025  down 2.2% at CER and on a like-for-like basis; the solid increase in volumes only partially offset the pressure on prices linked to the increased weight of distributors in the customer mix. In the third quarter of 2025  the fall in revenue (-5.7% at CER and on a like-for-like basis) can be explained in particular by a weaker performance in Latin America following the technical incident at our Raleigh plant.In Asia  revenue totaled €152.4 million at September 30  2025  down 4.3% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  linked to the loss of a customer by our distributor in Vietnam and the discontinuation of deliveries to one of our distributors in South Korea. In the third quarter alone  the trend was positive (+1.5%)  driven by strong sales in Japan.Q3 9 months In millions of euros 20242025% chg. % chg.at CER 20242025% chg. % chg.at CER Diagnostic Imaging 176.5 174.0 -1.4% +1.7% 542.6 508.0 -6.4% -4.0% MRI 60.7 65.0 +7.1% +9.6% 191.9 192.5 +0.3% +2.0% X-ray 115.7 108.9 -5.9% -2.4% 350.8 315.4 -10.1% -7.3% Interventional Imaging 23.7 24.8 +4.4% +8.8% 73.9 76.7 +3.8% +6.0% Total like-for-like 200.2 198.7 -0.7% +2.6% 616.5 584.7 -5.2% -2.8% Divested businesses* 1.2 0.0 - - 4.0 1.8 - - Total 201.3 198.7 -1.3% +2.0% 620.5 586.5 -5.5% -3.1%*Divested businesses: Accurate and urologyIn Diagnostic Imaging  revenue totaled €508.0 million at September 30  2025  down 4.0% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  with a return to growth in the third quarter alone (+1.7%).9-month sales of the IRM division were up 2.0% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  incorporating an increase of 9.6% in the third quarter  driven by an acceleration in the ramp-up of Elucirem TM in both the United States and Europe.were up 2.0% at CER and on a like-for-like basis  incorporating an increase of 9.6% in the third quarter  driven by an acceleration in the ramp-up of Elucirem in both the United States and Europe. 9-month sales of the X-ray division were down 7.3% at CER and on a like-for-like basis (-2.4% in the third quarter)  linked to the fall in volumes for Xenetix® and Optiray®  mainly due to activity in France.In Interventional Imaging  sales reached €76.7 million in the first nine months of the year  representing an increase at CER and on a like-for-like basis of 6.0%  of which +8.8% in the third quarter alone. This performance was fueled by the solid trajectory of Lipiodol® (volumes and prices)  particularly in vascular embolization.Confirmation of financial targets for 2025At the end of this third quarter marked by a return to growth  Guerbet is confident it will see an acceleration in the fourth quarter of 2025. This will be supported by the continued ramp-up of EluciremTM  expectations of a further acceleration for Lipiodol® (vascular embolization  Go Direct in China)  and positive momentum in indirect sales in several countries in Latin America  Europe and Asia.In this context  Guerbet confirms all of the financial targets announced on September 15th. For 2025  the Group anticipates a slight decline in revenue at CER and on a like-for-like basis of around -1%  together with a restated EBITDA margin3 of between 12-13%.

(the “Company” or “Besi”) (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30  2025.Key Highlights Q3-25Revenue of € 132.7 million decreased by 10.4% vs. Q2-25 and was at the midpoint of guidance. Revenue decreased 15.3% vs. Q3-24 principally due to the ongoing industry downturnIn contrast  orders of € 174.7 million increased by 36.5% vs. Q2-25 and 15.1% vs. Q3-24 principally due to a significant increase in bookings by Asian subcontractors for 2.5D datacenter and photonics applicationsBesi’s gross margin of 62.2% exceeded guidance. It decreased by 1.1 points vs. Q2-25 and 2.5 points vs. Q3-24 due primarily to adverse forex effects from the decline of the USD vs. the euroNet income of € 25.3 million decreased by 21.2% vs. Q2-25 and 45.9% vs. Q3-24 due principally to lower revenue and gross margins realized. Besi’s Q3-25 net margin decreased to 19.0% vs. 21.6% in Q2-25 and 29.9% in Q3-24Cash and deposits at September 30  2025 increased by € 28.4 million vs. June 30  2025  principally due to increased cash flow generated from operationsKey Highlights YTD-25Revenue of € 425.0 million decreased by 6.4% vs. YTD-24 principally due to ongoing weakness in mainstream assembly markets  particularly for mobile and automotive applications  partially offset by increased shipments to Asian subcontractors for data center applications and increased shipments of hybrid bonding systemsOrders of € 434.6 million were down 6.5% vs. YTD-24 primarily due to lower bookings for hybrid bonding and mobile applications  partially offset by increased die attach orders by Asian subcontractors for AI related computing applicationsGross margin of 63.1% decreased by 2.5 points vs. YTD-24 primarily due to adverse forex effectsNet income of € 88.8 million decreased by € 33.9 million  or 27.6%  vs. YTD-24 primarily due to lower revenue and gross margin and higher interest expense. Similarly  Besi’s net margin decreased to 20.9% versus 27.0% in YTD-24Q4-25 OutlookRevenue is expected to increase by 15-25% vs. the € 132.7 million reported in Q3-25 due to increased bookings levelsGross margin is expected to range between 61-63% vs. the 62.2% realized in Q3-25Operating expenses are expected to increase by 5-10% vs. the € 48.5 million reported in Q3-25 due to increased R&D expenses(€ millions  except EPS) Q3-2025 Q2-2025 Δ Q3-2024 Δ YTD-2025 YTD-2024 Δ Revenue 132.7 148.1 -10.4% 156.6 -15.3% 425.0 454.1 -6.4% Orders 174.7 128.0 +36.5% 151.8 +15.1% 434.6 464.8 -6.5% Gross Margin 62.2% 63.3% -1.1pts 64.7% -2.5pts 63.1% 65.6% -2.5pts Operating Income 34.1 43.5 -21.6% 55.1 -38.1% 116.8 145.0 -19.4% Net Income 25.3 32.1 -21.2% 46.8 -45.9% 88.8 122.7 -27.6% Net Margin 19.0% 21.6% -2.6%pts 29.9% -10.9pts 20.9% 27.0% -6.1pts EPS (basic) 0.32 0.40 -20.0% 0.59 -45.8% 1.12 1.56 -28.2% EPS (diluted) 0.32 0.40 -20.0% 0.59 -45.8% 1.12 1.55 -27.7% Net Cash and Deposits -7.8 -36.0 -78.3% 110.7 -107.0% -7.8 110.7 -107.0%Richard W. Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported Q3-25 revenue and operating results within prior guidance in an assembly equipment market showing early signs of recovery. Order levels improved significantly in Q3-25 with bookings of € 174.7 million increasing by 36.5% and 15.1% versus Q2-25 and Q3-24  respectively. For the quarter  revenue decreased by 10.4% and 15.3% versus Q2-25 and Q3-24  respectively  reflecting continued weakness in mainstream assembly markets  particularly for mobile and automotive applications  and lower hybrid bonding revenue. Operating income was higher than anticipated due to gross margin and operating expense development slightly better than forecast.The improved order outlook this quarter was principally due to a broad-based increase in die attach bookings by Asian subcontractors for 2.5D data center applications and renewed capacity purchases by leading photonics customers. We also noticed improvement in more mainstream electronics and automotive applications. A push out to Q4-25 of certain anticipated hybrid bonding bookings limited even stronger order development during the quarter. Progress on our wafer level assembly activities continued with new customers/orders received for both Besi’s hybrid bonding and TC Next systems in Q3-25.Besi’s results for the first nine months of 2025 reflected similar trends experienced in Q3-25 with revenue of € 425.0 million and orders of € 434.6 million decreasing by 6.4% and 6.5%  respectively  versus the comparable period of the prior year. In general  weakness in mobile and automotive applications this year has been partially offset by significantly increased die attach orders by Asian subcontractors for AI related computing applications. Year to date 2025 net income of € 88.8 million decreased by 27.6% versus the comparable 2024 period primarily due to lower revenue  lower gross margins realized primarily as a result of adverse forex effects and higher interest expense  net  related to our Senior Note issuance in July 2024.Liquidity remained strong with cash and deposits of € 518.6 million at September 30  2025 increasing by € 28.4 million  or 5.8%  versus June 30  2025 due to cash flow from operations more than doubling versus Q2-25. In addition  we completed our € 100 million share buyback program in October 2025 and authorized a new € 60 million share repurchase program with an anticipated completion date of October 2026.The outlook for Besi’s business has significantly improved based on Q3-25 order trends and continued order momentum to date in Q4-25. The improved outlook reflects increased demand for advanced packaging capacity necessary to support the rapid expansion of datacenters  software and next generation semiconductor devices required by the industry’s leading AI players. Advanced packaging is one of the key ways to achieve AI system differentiation  develop innovative consumer edge AI devices and provide the most energy-efficient datacenter performance.For Q4-25  we anticipate that revenue will increase by approximately 15-25% versus Q3-25 due to increased bookings levels. Besi’s gross margin is anticipated to range between 61-63%.

The use of words such as “anticipate”  “estimate”  “expect”  “can”  “intend”  “believes”  “may”  “plan”  “predict”  “project”  “forecast”  “will”  “would”  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. The financial guidance set forth under the heading “Outlook” contains such forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking statements represent our judgments and expectations concerning the development of our business  a number of risks  uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements  including any inability to maintain continued demand for our products; failure of anticipated orders to materialize or postponement or cancellation of orders  generally without charges; the volatility in the demand for semiconductors and our products and services; the extent and duration of the COVID-19 and other global pandemics and the associated adverse impacts on the global economy  financial markets  global supply chains and our operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers; failure to develop new and enhanced products and introduce them at competitive price levels; failure to adequately decrease costs and expenses as revenues decline; loss of significant customers  including through industry consolidation or the emergence of industry alliances; lengthening of the sales cycle; acts of terrorism and violence; disruption or failure of our information technology systems; consolidation activity and industry alliances in the semiconductor industry that may result in further increased customer concentration  inability to forecast demand and inventory levels for our products; the integrity of product pricing and protection of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; risks  such as changes in trade regulations  conflict minerals regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war  associated with substantial foreign customers  suppliers and foreign manufacturing operations  particularly to the extent occurring in the Asia Pacific region where we have a substantial portion of our production facilities; potential instability in foreign capital markets; the risk of failure to successfully manage our diverse operations; any inability to attract and retain skilled personnel  including as a result of restrictions on immigration  travel or the availability of visas for skilled technology workers.In addition  the United States and other countries have recently levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods and could significantly increase or impose new tariffs on a broad array of goods.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:Organic growth Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect) Impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:Constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period Constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:For acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year For acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated For disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group For disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 3 of this press release.2 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.3 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated over a 12-month period from Q3 2024 to Q2 2025.4 TAR: Total Accident Rate
