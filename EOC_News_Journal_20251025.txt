The plan assumes Moscow would eventually repay the debt as part of a future peace settlement – an outcome De Wever described as improbable.“I’m only poor little Belgium ” the prime minister said. “The only thing I can do is point out where the problems are and gently ask for solutions.”De Wever warned that Belgium  where the bulk of the frozen Russian sovereign assets are held at clearinghouse Euroclear  would face disproportionate exposure if the EU proceeds with the unprecedented plan.“Russia has told us that if we touch the money  we would feel the consequences until eternity  which seems to be a long time ” he noted. “Immobilized money is immune. It’s like an embassy. You don’t touch it.”Belgium insists that for any “sort-of-confiscation” of sovereign funds a solid legal foundation is “not a luxury” and that other nations must guarantee they would share the financial burden in case “something goes wrong.” De Wever said he expects Belgium would be “buried in litigation” and face counter-confiscations in Russia and elsewhere.“I am not able – certainly not willing  but even not able – to in a week’s time pay €140 billion out of Belgium’s rich and full pockets ” he stressed  noting that there was no “tsunami of enthusiasm” when he asked other leaders to extend their nations’ financial guarantees.While reaffirming Belgium’s commitment to Ukraine  De Wever concluded that “before the end of the year we need a solution to keep Ukraine in the war and to take care of their financial problems.”,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['EU-Ukraine ‘reparation loan’ plan', 'Poor little Belgium', 'failure', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'future peace settlement', 'reparation loan” scheme', 'solid legal foundation', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'nations’ financial guarantees', 'poor little Belgium', 'sovereign funds', 'large loan', 'other nations', 'major legal', 'key legal', 'central-bank assets', 'financial issues', 'financial risks', 'financial burden', 'disproportionate exposure', 'full pockets', 'other leaders', 'financial problems', 'long time', 'Immobilized money', 'EU leaders', 'unprecedented plan', 'Kiev', 'Ukraine', 'meeting', 'Thursday', 'reservations', 'collateral', 'Moscow', 'debt', 'part', 'outcome', 'thing', 'solutions', 'bulk', 'clearinghouse', 'Euroclear', 'consequences', 'eternity', 'embassy', 'confiscation', 'luxury', 'case', 'litigation', 'week', 'rich', 'tsunami', 'enthusiasm', 'commitment', 'end', 'year', 'war', 'care']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,rt.com

In theory  they are allowed to reclaim them — but in practice  that's nearly impossible.,"Alongside the reserves of Russia's central bank  assets belonging to private Russian investors have also been frozen in the EU. In theory  investors are allowed to reclaim them. But in practice  that's nearly impossible.The EU is currently debating whether to use frozen Russian assets to pay war reparations to Ukraine. In addition to the funds of Russia's central bank  European depositories are also holding frozen securities belonging to millions of Russian private investors who are not on Western sanctions lists.Legally  these investors are entitled to reclaim their assets  but in practice  very few have succeeded.EU leaders consider lending Russia's money to Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoZhanna Nemtsova  daughter of murdered Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov and co-founder of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom  has been drawing attention to this issue for months. Speaking with DW  she argued that private investors' assets should be released and has proposed a number of steps to make that possible.How were Russian assets frozen?The custody of Russian securities in depository banks is handled through Russia's central securities depository — the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  a subsidiary of the Moscow Exchange.However  for foreign securities that Russians could buy with just a few clicks through domestic brokerage apps before the war in Ukraine  the NSD acted merely as an intermediary. The securities themselves were held mainly at two European depositories: Belgium's Euroclear and Luxembourg's Clearstream.Nemtsova thinks the current proceedings to reclaim foreign assets by private Russians helps them cling to their wealth Image: Odd Anderson/AFP/Getty ImagesMany Russian investors only realized how the custody system worked in the spring of 2022  when they suddenly found themselves unable to carry out transactions. Their securities were frozen just like the Russian state reserves and the assets of individuals and organizations subject to sanctions.Euroclear and Clearstream cut ties with the NSD shortly after the war began in March 2022  in response to the Russian central bank's decision to prohibit Russian brokers from selling securities on behalf of foreign clients.In June  the European Commission legally codified Euroclear's and Clearstream's decisions. The EU's sixth sanctions package included an explicit ban on European entities cooperating with the NSD.How many Russian investors are affected?Neither Russian nor European authorities have published data on the amount of frozen private assets  and the depositories themselves have provided no figures. Only the total value of frozen assets in Europe is known  including the Russian state reserves  which account for the bulk of the total.According to news agency Reuters  the total stands at around €210 billion ($243 billion)  of which €185 billion are held by Euroclear.Russian authorities estimate that the worldwide frozen assets of Russian legal entities and individuals amount to about 5.7 trillion rubles — equaling roughly €12 billion at current exchange rates — about 20% of which belonging to private individuals.What should the EU do with frozen Russian assets? To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoThe exact number of investors is also unknown. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has cited 3.5 million people  while central bank representatives say the number is closer to 5 million.The discrepancy may be due to the higher estimate including not only direct holders of foreign securities but also those who invested indirectly  for example through investment funds.In broken down figures  the average frozen amount per investor comes to around €2 400.A Russian broker told Zhanna Nemtsova that most of his clients have about that amount frozen — around 200 000 rubles  or a little more than two average monthly Russian salaries.How can investors reclaim their assets?Investors can try to recover their assets if they are not on sanctions lists. To do so  they must obtain a license from Belgium's Finance Ministry  which regulates Euroclear. If the assets are frozen at Clearstream  they must apply to the financial authorities in Luxembourg.All Russian transactions involving foreign securities were conducted through Euroclear (pictured) or Clearstream Image: Werner Lerooy/ImagoIn practice  however  doing this without legal assistance is almost impossible. Moreover  the legal costs usually far exceed the average value of the frozen assets.According to Nemtsova  one investor who managed to secure the release of his funds from both Euroclear and Clearstream said the process cost him €60 000.Aleksey Klimyuk  senior investment adviser at Moscow-based asset management company Alfa Capital  told DW that in a first step an attorney must find a ""guarantor or serve as one.""The guarantor must then confirm that the applicant owns the assets  is not under sanctions and that no sanctioned person benefits from the transaction for which the license is being requested.In addition  the applicant must have an investment account in the EU  Switzerland  the UK or the US  since transfers to accounts in Russia are not permitted. Without a residence permit  opening such an account is impossible.According to the news platform Brussels Signal  Belgium received 1 214 license applications last year  of which 232 were approved. Most applicants were investors with dual citizenship — Russian and another European nationality.""You might think I'm defending the interests of the rich  but I'm not "" said Nemtsova. ""The current process actually protects their interests. What I want is to make them [funds] more accessible.""What are the prospects for those affected?According to Nemtsova  the first step is to draw public attention to the problem  as European officials often fail to ""grasp the full consequences of their sanctions policies"" and that the issue is scarcely covered in European media.As a next step  she proposes taking inventory of all frozen assets to determine which belong to private investors not on sanctions lists. After that  authorities in Belgium and Luxembourg should design a simplified procedure for investors who cannot afford expensive lawyers.Nemtsova admitted that only people with Western residence permits or citizenship would likely benefit from such changes. Everyone else will probably have to wait until the war ends and sanctions are eventually lifted.The fate of the Russian central bank's frozen assets is in the hands of the European Commission. When asked by DW whether the EU executive is also considering the future of private investors' assets  a Commission representative declined to comment  saying in a statement only that this was a ""hypothetical scenario.""Relaxing the rules on frozen assets is difficult  as it would require cooperation between the EU and the US Image: Daniel Torok/White House/ZUMA/picture allianceEven though the details of the frozen assets have not been disclosed  it's clear they mainly consist of American securities popular among Russian investors.According to broker data reviewed by DW at the end of 2021  the most sought-after shares were those of US companies Alphabet  Apple  Boeing  Intel  MetaTrader  Microsoft and Tesla  as well as the Chinese firms Alibaba and Baidu.To release US-based assets  a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department is required. OFAC has sanctioned both the Moscow Exchange and the NSD. According to lawyers representing Russian investors  as reported by the Russian news outlet RBC  OFAC has not yet issued a single such license.This article was originally written in Russian.Correction  October 25  2025: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Zhanna Nemtsova.

The matter is expected to return to the agenda in December.According to Bloomberg and Politico  EU officials made little headway at a Brussels summit on Thursday on the plan to use immobilized Russian central bank assets as collateral for a proposed €140 billion ($163 billion) “reparation loan” to Kiev. The proposal assumes that the sum will be repaid if Ukraine wins the conflict with Russia and Moscow agrees to pay reparations – which is widely considered unlikely.Russia has condemned Western efforts to use its frozen funds to aid Ukraine  calling the move “theft.”Politico reported that the talks “were thrown into disarray” after Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took what one official described as a “surprisingly uncompromising position” on the loan. Belgium  which has legal control over the bulk of the frozen funds through Brussels-based Euroclear  has demanded that all EU members share the responsibility “if it goes wrong.”As a result  Belgium backed a compromise text that effectively delayed a firm commitment. The current draft seen by Politico “invites the [EU] Commission to present  as soon as possible  options for financial support ” replacing earlier language that called for a legal proposal.Belgium’s opposition left some EU officials unhappy  with one source telling Politico: “Nobody wants to be seen to be responsible for Ukraine running out of money – but there’s nothing [agreed] yet to actually send them any money.”According to Bloomberg  EU leaders plan to review the possibilities at the next summit  with the goal being “to get a final agreement by the end of the year.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that using Russian assets to finance Kiev would “boomerang ” adding that “if someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.”,negative,0.01,0.4,0.59,negative,0.0,0.43,0.57,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'media', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Russian central bank assets', 'stronger legal safeguards', 'controversial loan scheme', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'legal control', 'legal prosecution', 'frozen funds', 'bloc leaders', 'EU leaders', 'EU officials', 'little headway', 'Brussels summit', 'reparation loan', 'Western efforts', 'one official', 'uncompromising position', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'EU members', 'compromise text', 'firm commitment', 'current draft', 'financial support', 'earlier language', 'one source', 'next summit', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal proposal', 'final agreement', 'Belgium', 'demand', 'risk', 'guarantees', 'billions', 'sovereign', 'Ukraine', 'matter', 'agenda', 'December', 'Bloomberg', 'Politico', 'Thursday', 'plan', 'collateral', 'Kiev', 'conflict', 'Moscow', 'reparations', 'move', 'talks', 'disarray', 'bulk', 'responsibility', 'result', 'options', 'opposition', 'Nobody', 'money', 'possibilities', 'goal', 'year', 'someone', 'property']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,rt.com

Germany would face the biggest risk among EU member states in the event of retaliation from Moscow  the chief of the German-Russian Chamber of Commerce told the news agency.The European Commission has been pushing a plan to raise around €140 billion ($160 billion) for a ‘reparations loan’ for Kiev  claiming the funds could later be recovered from Moscow. Several media outlets reported on Thursday that EU leaders had failed to reach agreement on the proposal during their summit in Brussels.Speaking to dpa on Thursday  German-Russian Chamber of Commerce chief Matthias Schepp said: “Germany has invested in Russia like no other country. Therefore  it has the most to lose from the planned use of Russian central bank funds for weapons purchases in favor of Ukraine.”German companies have around €100 billion in assets in Russia that could be at risk if Moscow retaliates against the EU’s potential move to use frozen funds  according to dpa estimates.Several member states have expressed reservations about the plan. Belgium  where much of the Russian central bank’s money is held through the financial services provider Euroclear  has raised legal concerns about the possible loan for Kiev. Hungary has also resisted the measure. Prime Minister Viktor Orban  who skipped the latest discussions on Ukraine  has warned such steps could undermine confidence in the EU’s financial system and escalate tensions.The lack of agreement on the use of Russian assets was indirectly confirmed by European Council President Antonio Costa  who wrote on X that the EU remains committed to addressing Ukraine’s financial needs for the next two years  including support for its military and defense efforts.Moscow has repeatedly said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that channeling Russian funds to Ukraine would “boomerang ” adding that “if someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.”,neutral,0.01,0.89,0.1,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Germany', 'media', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Commerce chief Matthias Schepp', 'Russian central bank funds', 'The European Commission', 'Several media outlets', 'Several member states', 'next two years', '€140 billion ‘reparation loan', 'financial services provider', 'EU member states', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'reparations loan', 'frozen funds', 'possible loan', 'financial system', 'financial needs', 'frozen assets', 'German companies', 'German-Russian Chamber', 'news agency', 'other country', 'weapons purchases', 'potential move', 'legal concerns', 'latest discussions', 'defense efforts', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal prosecution', 'EU leaders', 'biggest risk', 'planned use', 'dpa estimates', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'losses', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'Germany', 'event', 'retaliation', 'Kiev', 'agreement', 'proposal', 'summit', 'favor', 'reservations', 'Belgium', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Hungary', 'measure', 'steps', 'confidence', 'tensions', 'lack', 'support', 'military', 'theft', 'someone', 'property']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,rt.com

Ukraine using Russian frozen assets  in a bid to bolster Kyiv as US President Donald Trump vacillates on peace efforts with Moscow.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will join a summit of the EU's 27 leaders in Brussels -- before heading to London on Friday -- as Europe presses to shore up support after Trump put on ice a proposed meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Budapest.Zelensky and his key backers are seeking to seize on Trump's demand for Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting along the current front line and shift the onus from Kyiv to Moscow to make concessions.Hopes that Trump could take against Putin got a boost Wednesday when US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Washington would unveil ""a substantial pickup"" in sanctions against Russia  and accused the Russian leader of not being ""honest and forthright"" in talks.While the talks in the British capital look set to focus more on keeping the mercurial US leader on board  the summit in Brussels will centre on how to keep funding Ukraine and piling more pressure on Moscow.A key part of the EU's support for Kyiv rests on a plan for a new 140-billion-euro ($163-billion) ""reparations loan"" funded by Russian central bank assets frozen in the bloc.Belgium  where the bulk of the money is held at international deposit organisation Euroclear  has demanded guarantees the rest of the EU will share any liabilities if Russia goes to court.While key questions remain  diplomats hope EU leaders will give the bloc's executive the go-ahead to draw up a formal legal proposal for the loan that would only be paid back by Kyiv once Moscow coughs up for the damage it has wrought during its invasion of Ukraine.""It's essential to do it to be able to keep Ukraine in the fight "" an EU diplomat said  speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Officials say the funds -- the bulk of which the European Commission says should be earmarked to buy weapons in Europe -- could keep Ukraine going for at least another two years.Even if an initial nod is given at the summit  there still looks set to be months of wrangling over the small print before the loan can be finalised.""There are many issues still on the table "" the diplomat said.- Sanctions unblocked -At the same time as it looks to ensure Kyiv remains afloat  the EU has also sought to turn the screws on Moscow with new sanctions.Just ahead of the summit  EU countries agreed Wednesday to impose a biting new round of measures -- including a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas from end 2026.Kremlin-friendly Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico held up approval for the sanctions until he got assurances from Brussels over protections for Bratislava's car industry.The sanctions also see the EU blacklist more tankers in Russia's ""shadow fleet""  used to get round oil export restrictions  and impose new rules on Moscow's diplomats to curb their travel around Europe.While attention will primarily home in on the current war wracking the continent  leaders will also cover plans to prepare for a potential broader conflict with Russia in the future.After a series of high-profile air incursions and mysterious drone flights  Brussels has proposed building a system of anti-drone defences as one of a number of urgently needed defence priorities.Leaders are set to endorse a roadmap that aims to prepare the EU for war by 2030.Related LinksLearn about the Superpowers of the 21st Century at SpaceWar.comLearn about nuclear weapons doctrine and defense at

53373,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2025/1024/1540455-ukraine-eu/,EU faces rethink on frozen Russian assets for Ukraine,Ukraine's survival depends hugely on Volodymyr Zelensky finding favour with US President Donald Trump  but such favour is an on-again  off-again mystery. However  EU leaders continue to rally behind the Ukrainian President.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did his best to project a wry optimism when he spoke to reporters at the EU summit yesterday.Ukraine's survival depends hugely on Mr Zelensky finding favour with US President Donald Trump  but such favour is an on-again  off-again mystery.It had been reported that in his White House meeting last week  Mr Trump had told the Ukrainian president to do a deal or be ""destroyed"" by Russia.Russian president Vladimir Putin  it seemed  had got to the US president first with a phone call ahead of Mr Zelensky’s Oval Office encounter.Long-range US Tomahawk missiles  which had been teasingly on offer  were out; a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest was in.Once again  EU leaders were rallying to Mr Zelensky’s side.Yet yesterday it looked like the pendulum was swinging back. Ahead of the Brussels summit  Mr Trump had suddenly cancelled the Budapest summit and slapped sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil  the two main Russian crude oil producers.""So  the result of this (White House) meeting (was) "" President Zelensky told the Brussels press corp  ""we have sanctions on Russian energy. We don't have a meeting in Hungary without Ukraine  and we have not yet got Tomahawks. This is the result. I think - not bad. Each day brings something (new). Maybe tomorrow we will have Tomahawks. I don't know.""But the Ukrainian president’s mind was no doubt on ongoing deliberations close by within the Europa Building  where EU leaders were continuing to grapple with how to convert €140 billion of immobilised Russian assets into a loan for Ukraine.Mr Zelensky  fresh from addressing EU leaders  admitted the issue was ""not simple"" but stressed that it was in Europe’s interest as well as Ukraine’s that the country has stable financial and military support for the next two years.Ukrainian and EU officials increasingly stress  as Europe embarks on a drive to boost its military defences ahead of a 2030 deadline  that EU and NATO militaries have a lot to learn from Ukraine’s battlefield experience  particularly at the cutting edge of drone warfare.""We have technologies "" the president said.""We are ready to share with the countries who helped us during this war.""Therefore  converting Russian assets was a win-win for both and would put more pressure on Mr Putin to end the war.Not so fast  said Belgian prime minister Bart de Wever. Belgium has reluctantly found itself the centre of attention in blocking the loan  saying it would be ""insane"" for the country to singlehandedly take on the legal and financial risks of seizing Russian assets.US President Donald Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives for a meeting at the White House in Washington  DCFollowing Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the EU  G7 and other countries jointly froze some €300bn in Russian central bank assets held overseas. Because 62% of those assets (an estimated €180bn) has been held in the Belgian-registered securities depository Euroclear  any move to seize the funds would have disproportionate implications for one EU member state.Arriving at the summit  Mr De Wever warned that not even during World War II were central bank assets seized: this was a massive risk  and it could not be borne by Belgium alone.He had three demands: that the risk had to be carried by all member states  that if the assets ever had to be paid back  then ""every member state will chip in""  and that any other country which had been quietly holding immobilised Russian assets would also have to move.If the three ""reasonable"" demands were met  then EU leaders could proceed to ask the European Commission to come up with a legal text to make it happen.""If not "" said Mr De Wever  a Flemish nationalist politician  ""I will do everything in my power at the European level  also at the national level  politically and legally  to stop this decision.""Diplomats have acknowledged that Belgium  which had obdurately opposed using the assets ever since they had been frozen  had been softening its position.Belgian officials had been working closely with the European Commission on what mutualisation of risk would look like  how would guarantees work  what would happen if Russia did not just sue Belgium in international courts but started seizing the assets of Belgian companies in Russia  or if Russia-friendly countries did likewise.But key questions remained.How broadly or narrowly would ""risk"" be defined? If Belgian companies were targeted in Russia  should other member states  whose corporations had quit Russia after the invasion  be on the hook?What would happen if not all member states signed up as co-guarantors? Would that mean the countries that do take on an even bigger risk? How open-ended would the guarantee be? Ireland  for example  may need to introduce legislation  as had been required for one of the EU’s post-COVID recovery programmes.What would the money be spent on? Only military support  or also for civilian needs (or both)  and if the former  would money underwritten by European taxpayers be bankrolling jobs in the US defence sector?Yet  all member states  Belgium included  keenly acknowledge the dire situation Ukraine faces.While a Russian summer offensive failed to make any significant gains  Kyiv desperately needs air defence systems to counter the devastating effect of Russian ballistic missiles (President Zelensky said Ukraine would have no option but to spend loan money on US Patriot PAC III air defence systems).The reality is also dawning on European capitals that with the Trump administration tapering off financial support  the EU is increasingly going to have to foot the military bill.The cost of reconstruction  meanwhile  has soared to an estimated $529bn.Arriving at the summit  Taoiseach Micheál Martin said allowing Russia off the hook would create a ""perverse incentive"" for Moscow to attack other European countries. The cost of the war  three and a half years in  was a growing burden on EU economies.""Europe is doing a hell of a lot in terms of underpinning Ukraine's economy "" he told reporters. ""We have to support Ukraine in defending its sovereignty and its territorial integrity from a budget perspective  from a humanitarian perspective.""He added: ""The costs of this war we are already paying for in different ways  (for example) in increased energy prices. This is the first major war on the continent of Europe  and that is having consequences.""Leaders got down to discussing the Russian assets issue after President Zelensky made his presentation  but it was soon clear that Belgium’s concerns were complex.The Russian central bank assets immobilised in February 2022 were mainly in government bonds held in Euroclear. However  90% have since matured to cash and have been placed in low-risk accounts managed by the Belgian Central Bank.Those accounts then yielded large profits which were used  after much back and forth  to underwrite a €45bn EU-G7 loan to Ukraine in October 2024 (the so-called extraordinary revenue acceleration  or ERA  loan).According to an internal note circulated by the European Commission to member states  this new and more ambitious idea would involve the EU issuing a ""tailor-made debt contract"" to Euroclear  essentially borrowing the accumulated cash balances.These proceeds would then be converted into a so-called reparations loan to Ukraine  one that Kyiv would only have to pay back once Russia started making war reparations.The Commission note insisted the freezing of Russian assets was ""firmly based in EU and international law"". The risk was not falling on Belgium  but on the EU as a whole  and under EU law  Russia would not be able to force any potential claim against assets within the EU  Belgian or otherwise.""If enforced against assets outside of the EU  the exposure towards the Russian Central Bank would be reduced correspondingly. This results in a remaining residual risk that is both low in probability of materialising and low in value "" said the note.Despite that  Mr de Wever was clearly not convinced during the meeting that these convictions gave Belgium the cast-iron guarantees he was looking for. One senior EU source acknowledged that the size of the Reparations Loan - €140 billion - was the equivalent of Belgium’s annual budget.During yesterday's summit  Belgium was still resisting a draft text that would explicitly ask the European Commission to come forward with a legal text to make the thing happen.Later  leaders sought the views of the ECB president Christine Lagarde  and eurogroup president  and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe  what they thought.The ECB initially resisted any seizure of Russian assets  as posing a risk to the eurozone as a place where countries around the world could hold euro-denominated assets.In March of this year  Ms Lagarde told a news conference that international rules would have to be adhered to: ""I would certainly submit that the international law basis on which any decision is made will matter as far as other investors are concerned  and I’m sure it’s another element that will be taken into account "" by EU leaders.In Copenhagen on 19 September  the ECB president did not hide her irritation at the apparent lack of a detailed plan from the Commission about how the Reparations Loan would mitigate any legal or reputational risks.While she told EU leaders last night that the risks were manageable  the message appeared to be that the ECB could not take a definitive position until there was a much more fleshed-out legal proposal.While some leaders - the Taoiseach Micheál Martin included - were keen that the final communiqué formally invite the Commission to go ahead and produce a legal text  Belgium - and a number of others - were not prepared to go that far.As a result  the statement was relatively anodyne.Leaders ""commit to address Ukraine’s pressing financial needs for 2026-2027  including for its military and defence efforts "" with the Commission being invited to present ""options"" for meeting those needs  with a view to advancing the issue at the December summit.The statement did not spell out what the ""options"" were  or whether there was a plan B  except that ""subject to EU law  Russia’s assets should remain immobilised until Russia ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates it for the damage caused by its war.European Commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  insisted that  no matter what  Ukraine's funding needs for the next two years would be metThat means we are back to the drawing board.Optimists suggest that the work between the Commission and Belgium will simply have to intensify bilaterally so that a text which is detailed and covers all the areas of concern - both for Belgium and member states - can be prepared in time for the December EU summit.Critics say a lot more of this work has to be circulated to eurozone finance ministers and the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC)  which advises the eurogroup.""The Commission doesn’t yet have the authorisation to produce a full legal text  but they need to be more precise in what they're thinking and to get that around some of the member states. Equally  Belgium needs to provide us with a more detailed analysis of what they're looking for "" says one eurozone source.Last night  the European Commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  attempted a positive gloss on the day’s events  insisting that  no matter what  Ukraine’s funding needs for the next two years would be met.""We agreed on the what  now we have to work on the how "" said Ms von der Leyen.Kyiv will be watching anxiously.",neutral,0.0,0.74,0.26,mixed,0.12,0.24,0.64,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'rethink', 'Ukraine', 'two main Russian crude oil producers', 'Belgian-registered securities depository Euroclear', 'Long-range US Tomahawk missiles', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Russian president Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank assets', 'one EU member state', 'next two years', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Oval Office encounter', 'Bart de Wever', 'Flemish nationalist politician', 'post-COVID recovery programmes', 'Brussels press corp', 'Belgian prime minister', 'Mr De Wever', 'three ""reasonable"" demands', 'World War II', 'White House meeting', 'White House) meeting', 'other member states', 'Mr Trump', 'Mr Putin', 'Russian energy', 'three demands', 'President Zelensky', 'Russian assets', 'Mr Zelensky', 'Brussels summit', 'Belgian officials', 'Belgian companies', 'wry optimism', 'phone call', 'ongoing deliberations', 'Europa Building', 'stable financial', 'military support', 'military defences', 'NATO militaries', 'battlefield experience', 'cutting edge', 'drone warfare', 'financial risks', 'disproportionate implications', 'European Commission', 'European level', 'national level', 'international courts', 'key questions', 'civilian needs', 'European taxpayers', 'EU leaders', 'EU officials', 'other countries', 'Trump-Putin summit', 'EU summit', 'other country', 'full-scale invasion', 'legal text', 'Russia-friendly countries', 'massive risk', 'bigger risk', 'Budapest summit', 'reporters', 'Ukraine', 'survival', 'favour', 'again', 'mystery', 'deal', 'offer', 'pendulum', 'sanctions', 'Rosneft', 'Lukoil', 'result', 'Hungary', 'Tomahawks', 'day', 'something', 'mind', 'doubt', 'loan', 'issue', 'interest', 'drive', '2030 deadline', 'lot', 'technologies', 'win', 'pressure', 'Belgium', 'centre', 'attention', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Moscow', 'February', 'G7', 'move', 'funds', 'everything', 'power', 'decision', 'Diplomats', 'position', 'mutualisation', 'guarantees', 'work', 'corporations', 'hook', 'guarantors', 'Ireland', 'example', 'legislation', 'money', 'bankrollin']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,rte.ie

Instead  leaders issued a much vaguer commitment to ""addressing Ukraine's pressing financial needs"" for the next two years  and vowed to revisit the issue of Russian assets in December.""We agreed on the 'what' — that is the reparation loan  and we have to work on the 'how' — how we make it possible "" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels after the talks.Standing by her side  Council chief Antonio Costa insisted no one had vetoed anything  while Germany's Friedrich Merz called the outcome ""a step forward.""EU leaders consider lending Russia's money to Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video'Risky business'But two floors below  Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever told journalists another side of the story. His country is home to Euroclear  the financial institution which hosts the bulk of some €200 billion in Russian central bank assets that were immobilized by the EU when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.De Wever warned that the legal ""uncharted territory"" of using the cash for Ukraine now would trigger costly Russian retaliation and scare off future investors.""It's risky business. Besides the counter-confiscations and counter-measures  we will be buried in litigation "" he said  adding that his concerns had not yet been answered.Last year  the EU began using profits generated from the frozen cash as collateral for loans to Ukraine — but the idea under discussion now would go further by targeting the assets themselves  without seizing them outright.Russian news agency TASS quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson in Moscow promising a ""very painful  very harsh"" response if Brussels pursues its plan.De Wever suggested other states outside the EU where Russian funds are also frozen should be willing to run the same risks  pointing to Canada  the UK  Switzerland  Japan and the US. ""The fattest chicken is in Belgium  but there are other chickens around "" he said.""It would be almost poetic that Ukraine is supported with the Russian money. It's a 'Robin Hood' story. For public opinion  it's a bestseller "" De Wever added  ""but on the other hand  the back side of the envelope is real.""European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde joined EU leaders for their talks in Brussels Image: Francois Walschaerts/REUTERSDecember: yes or no?Thursday's non-decision will now usher in months of legal research and wrangling as the EU's executive tries to draw up a solution that might meet Belgium's demand for ""concrete” guarantees.On paper  there are other ways the EU could offer Ukraine the funds it says are urgently needed to stay afloat — like by taking on new joint debt. But that's even less likely to garner sufficient backing from the bloc's members within the coming weeks.Poland's Donald Tusk  who has long pushed the EU to send Russia's cash to Ukraine  insisted that December must be the ""final deadline"" for a ""yes or no"" decision. ""We are trying to convince our Belgian friends that we are ready to build a mechanism of shared  pan-European responsibility "" he said.The EU is sanctioning imports of Russian liquified natural gas for the first time Image: Danil Shamkin/NurPhoto/IMAGOGreen light for gas sanctionsBut while leaders failed to seal the deal on future loans  they did manage to greenlight another round of sanctions on Russia.Early Thursday morning  EU states agreed to ban imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) from 2027  advancing a deadline agreed by energy ministers earlier this week.The new sanctions target Russian crypto currency transfers and see more tankers from the so-called ""shadow fleet"" Moscow uses to evade existing oil sanctions added to a blacklist.For the first time  the EU also sanctioned two Chinese refineries which process and sell Russian oil. Beijing swiftly promised to ""take the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises "" according to Xinhua news agency.Zelenskyy welcomed the US decision to sanction two Russian oil companies Image: Evan Vucci/AP Photo/picture allianceTrump's Russia sanctionsThose announcements of fresh EU restrictions came hot on the heels of the US hitting two Russian fossil fuel giants with its own sanctions.Russia said Washington's move would have little impact on its economy  but French President Emmanuel Macron called it ""a true turning point.""""Until now  the US had refused "" he told journalists in Brussels late Thursday night.Given that just a few days ago  leaders feared US President Trump could soon be cozying up to Russia's Vladimir Putin in Hungary — EU's most Russia-friendly state — Kyiv's European allies may well feel some relief as they head back to their capitals.""It's the Trump rollercoaster. Things go up  things go down  a lot of turbulence "" Steven Everts  a former EU official turned analyst with the European Institute for Security Studies  told DW ahead of the summit.""The most important thing that Europeans need to do now is to really step on the accelerator when it comes to the diplomacy.

Ukraine will have the financial resources it needs to defend itself against Russia's aggression "" he said.Costa added that it is possible to solve the technical issues that need to be sorted out to move forward with the use of frozen assets  meaning ""this solution is feasible.""The European Union froze some 200 billion euros ($232 billion) of Russian central bank assets after Moscow's tanks rolled into Ukraine in 2022. So far the EU has used only the interest to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia.Moscow warned on October 23 that any actions taken with Russian assets without Russia's consent are ""null and void from the standpoint of international and contract law"" and will ""result in a painful response.""The bloc developed the loan scheme after it came under pressure to provide additional aid to Kyiv when US support slowed under President Donald Trump.Under the scheme  which the commission insists would not touch the Russian sovereign assets  the EU would borrow funds from Euroclear that have matured into cash.That money would then be loaned to Ukraine  which would only have to repay the loan if Russia pays for the damage it has caused in Ukraine.Most of the assets in question are held in Belgium  whose prime minister  Bart De Wever  said he still has several concerns.De Wever has insisted that  to move ahead  Belgium needs firm guarantees from all other EU states that they will share the liability if Moscow comes calling. He also wants other EU countries to promise to start tapping Russian assets frozen in their territories.""I'm only poor little Belgium  the only thing I can do is point out where the problems are and to gently ask solutions for the essential problem "" De Wever told reporters after the summit.He warned that unless those conditions were met  he would do all in his power ""politically and legally  to stop this decision.""The summit conclusions  which were adopted by all member states except Hungary  had to be watered down in light of the objections from Belgium.The text did not mention the loan directly  instead inviting the commission to present ""options for financial support"" for Ukraine for 2026 and 2027 -- to be presented to leaders at their next summit in December.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  who attended the summit as a guest  still said the meeting brought ""good results.""""The European Union assured that financial assistance to Ukraine will be maintained not only next year  but also in 2027 "" Zelenskyy said on X. ""This is an important unanimous decision. We have secured political support with regard to frozen Russian assets and their maximum use to defend against Russian aggression.""German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  one of the proponents of the scheme  said he expects the commission to come forward with the different options ahead of the next EU summit.""We are increasing the pressure to get the Russian side to agree to negotiations so that the guns finally fall silent in Ukraine "" Merz said.""Ukraine needs reliable prospects  especially when it comes to military equipment. We Europeans must send this signal of strength now "" he added.The EU talks were taking place a day after the bloc agreed a 19th package of sanctions on Russia and after the United States hit Moscow with sanctions on two large oil companies.Zelenskyy hailed the US sanctions as sending a ""strong and much-needed message"" to Russia.With reporting by AFP and dpaSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-european-union- reparations-loan/33569110.htmlCopyright (c) 2025.

And we have to work on the ‘how’ – how we make it possible.' Photograph: Frederick Florin/AFP via Getty ImagesThe funny thing about red lines set out by the European Union’s top politicians is how they can seem so rigid until they need to be a bit elastic – then watch them stretch.A Brussels summit of the heads of the 27 capitals broke up without agreement on a legally creative plan to fund a loan for Ukraine by tapping €185 billion of Russian state cash  frozen in Europe thanks to economic sanctions put on Moscow after its all-out invasion in 2022.Belgium  which hosts the bond depository Euroclear where the Russian central bank assets are immobilised  withheld its backing for the plan. Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever is looking for stronger assurances any legal risk would be borne by all EU states.One or two years ago the suggestion that Europe should funnel the frozen Russian assets to Ukraine to help finance its forces was a total non-starter. Confiscating the assets would breach international law and could not be considered.The war has continued and the ability of European governments to send tens of billions of euro from their own budgets to Kyiv is being strained. At the same time military aid from the US has stopped under president Donald Trump.To fill the growing gap between what Ukraine needs to keep fighting and what Europe can provide  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German chancellor Friedrich Merz proposed looking at the Russian assets.Commission officials are designing a loan structure that they say will allow the EU to take the cash for Ukraine and replace it with an IOU that would be repaid if Moscow compensates Kyiv after the war. Therefore nothing is really – or legally – being confiscated  officials say.Christine Lagarde  European Central Bank president  told leaders she could give her blessing to the loan plan provided certain questions were answered.[ EU leaders defer decision on Russian assets as Belgium balksOpens in new window ]Intense negotiations took place between the commission and the Belgian government on the margins of the summit. The hope was to get EU leaders to agree a joint communique giving political backing to the loan idea  leaving the more technical and legal questions to be ironed out later.De Wever  a hard-right politician facing domestic coalition pressure  ultimately signed off on a joint statement saying “options for financial support” should be put on the table the next time leaders meet in December. He was not the only one in the room who raised concerns.“We agreed on the ‘what’ – that is the reparations loans. And we have to work on the ‘how’ – how we make it possible ” von der Leyen said in a late-night press conference after the summit on Thursday.Failing to convince leaders the loan is legally and politically sound when they meet again in December would be a major setback. Ukraine will begin to run low on funds by the middle of next year.It is expected Belgium can brought around  but that may not be the hard part.The mechanics of the loan would probably require national parliaments to pass financial guarantees to cover the cost in a worst-case scenario where repayment to Russia is triggered without Moscow compensating Ukraine. That could happen if EU sanctions freezing the Russian assets (or the €185 billion IOU) are lifted.The sanctions need to be unanimously renewed every six months. Hungary’s populist prime minister Viktor Orban  who opposes the EU supporting Ukraine  has toyed with blocking the rollover in the past.Reforming the sanctions system  something all 27 leaders – including Orban – would need to authorise  will be politically very difficult.Alternatively  EU states could jointly borrow money themselves to finance a large loan to Ukraine  but Merz and other fiscally conservative leaders would have to first drop their opposition to taking on shared European debt.A decision will have to be made soon.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.2,0.22,0.58,True,English,"['EU red lines', 'The Irish Times', 'Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever', 'populist prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'German chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'European Central Bank president', 'other fiscally conservative leaders', 'Russian central bank assets', 'president Donald Trump', 'bond depository Euroclear', 'domestic coalition pressure', 'late-night press conference', 'European Commission president', 'Russian state cash', 'Belgian government', 'European Union', 'Russian assets', 'European governments', 'European debt', 'reparations loans', 'Frederick Florin/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'funny thing', 'red lines', 'top politicians', 'stronger assurances', 'legal risk', 'total non-starter', 'international law', 'same time', 'military aid', 'growing gap', 'Christine Lagarde', 'new window', 'Intense negotiations', 'joint communique', 'hard-right politician', 'joint statement', 'financial support', 'major setback', 'next year', 'hard part', 'national parliaments', 'financial guarantees', 'worst-case scenario', 'economic sanctions', 'Commission officials', 'sanctions system', 'EU states', 'creative plan', 'loan structure', 'loan idea', 'large loan', 'political backing', 'legal questions', '€185 billion IOU', 'EU sanctions', 'EU leaders', 'Brussels summit', 'loan plan', '27 leaders', 'Photograph', 'heads', '27 capitals', 'agreement', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Belgium', 'suggestion', 'forces', 'war', 'ability', 'billions', 'budgets', 'Kyiv', 'blessing', 'decision', 'place', 'margins', 'hope', 'technical', 'options', 'table', 'December', 'room', 'concerns', 'Thursday', 'funds', 'middle', 'mechanics', 'cost', 'repayment', 'Hungary', 'rollover', 'past', 'something', 'money', 'opposition']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,irishtimes.com
53378,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/10/24/eu-leaders-defer-decision-on-russian-assets-as-belgium-balks/,EU leaders defer decision on Russian assets as Belgium balks,Ireland had supported move but decision among EU bloc pushed back to December,The European Union has put off until December a decision on whether to tap frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine  threatening an effort to get Ukraine fresh funding by early 2026.Talks stalled after Belgium demanded greater assurances it would not be held liable for risks linked to the proposed €140 billion in loans  given the money is mostly held in Belgium.Ultimately  EU leaders asked the European Commission  the EU’s executive arm  to come up with Ukraine financing options to consider at their next summit. European Council president Antonio Costa told reporters he expects a final decision then.Any further delay could cause setbacks for Ukraine  which needs a new injection of funds by early 2026.Ukraine’s European allies increasingly see tapping Russian assets as the only viable way to continue financing Kyiv in its fight against Moscow’s full-scale invasion  currently well into its fourth year.The plan to use Russian assets had received the backing of the Irish Government. “I support the European Union initiative  I don’t believe there are implications for neutrality. We are militarily neutral ” Taoiseach Michaél Martin said in advance of a meeting on Thursday.The bill for Ukraine is growing after US president Donald Trump’s administration halted funding  saying it would only sell weapons paid for by other western allies.“The European Council commits to address Ukraine’s pressing financial needs for 2026-2027  including for its military and defence efforts ” leaders said in their conclusions.“The European Council invites the commission to present  as soon as possible  options for financial support based on an assessment of Ukraine’s financing needs.”Belgium has repeatedly voiced reservations about using the Russian assets as the biggest share of the funds – about €180 billion – sits at Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear. The country is worried about being left on the hook if Russia successfully sues to get the money back. Moscow has said it will retaliate if the assets are seized. The EU plans do not include seizing the assets outright.Speaking in advance the summit on Thursday  Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever warned he would not sign up to the initiative unless other countries addressed his concerns.Mr De Wever said he wanted “full mutualisation of the risk” in case Moscow makes claims on the assets. He also wants legally binding guarantees that member states would contribute if the money has to be repaid and for all countries holding frozen assets to take joint action.During a debate among the bloc’s leaders  Belgium urged the bloc to tap Russian central bank assets immobilised in other member states  according to people familiar with the matter. About €25 billion in assets are frozen in several other capitals.Strong guarantees are “the absolute condition before you can move forward ” Mr De Wever told reporters after the meeting. “If you take the money and the market sees that there is no liquidity solution for when it goes wrong  you’re immediately in trouble.”Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy  who joined the European leaders in Brussels on Thursday  urged them to deliver the loans at the start of 2026  with the war-torn country running out of resources and funds.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after the summit that it “was very clear in the discussion” that EU countries broadly supported using the assets.“In other words  we agreed on the what – that is the reparations loan ” she said. “And we have to work on the how – how we make it possible  what is the best option to move forward.” – Bloomberg,neutral,0.02,0.82,0.16,negative,0.0,0.36,0.64,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'decision', 'Belgium', 'Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever', 'European Council president Antonio Costa', 'Taoiseach Michaél Martin', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Mr De Wever', 'The European Council', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'The European Union', 'several other capitals', 'European Commission president', 'other western allies', 'pressing financial needs', 'European Union initiative', 'other member states', 'Ukraine financing options', 'Ukrainian president', 'European allies', 'financing needs', 'Russian assets', 'other words', 'financial support', 'European leaders', 'other countries', 'greater assurances', 'executive arm', 'new injection', 'viable way', 'full-scale invasion', 'fourth year', 'Irish Government', 'defence efforts', 'biggest share', 'full mutualisation', 'binding guarantees', 'joint action', 'Strong guarantees', 'absolute condition', 'liquidity solution', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'reparations loan', 'best option', 'frozen assets', 'EU plans', 'fresh funding', 'final decision', 'war-torn country', 'EU countries', 'next summit', 'EU leaders', 'December', 'early', 'Talks', 'Belgium', 'risks', 'loans', 'money', 'reporters', 'delay', 'setbacks', 'funds', 'Kyiv', 'fight', 'Moscow', 'backing', 'implications', 'neutrality', 'advance', 'meeting', 'Thursday', 'bill', 'administration', 'weapons', 'military', 'conclusions', 'assessment', 'reservations', 'Euroclear', 'hook', 'concerns', 'case', 'claims', 'debate', 'bloc', 'people', 'matter', 'market', 'trouble', 'start', 'resources', 'discussion', 'Bloomberg']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,irishtimes.com

In theory  they are allowed to reclaim them — but in practice  that's nearly impossible.,"Alongside the reserves of Russia's central bank  assets belonging to private Russian investors have also been frozen in the EU. In theory  investors are allowed to reclaim them. But in practice  that's nearly impossible.The EU is currently debating whether to use frozen Russian assets to pay war reparations to Ukraine. In addition to the funds of Russia's central bank  European depositories are also holding frozen securities belonging to millions of Russian private investors who are not on Western sanctions lists.Legally  these investors are entitled to reclaim their assets  but in practice  very few have succeeded.EU leaders consider lending Russia's money to Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoZhanna Nemtsova  daughter of murdered Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov and co-founder of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom  has been drawing attention to this issue for months. Speaking with DW  she argued that private investors' assets should be released and has proposed a number of steps to make that possible.How were Russian assets frozen?The custody of Russian securities in depository banks is handled through Russia's central securities depository — the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  a subsidiary of the Moscow Exchange.However  for foreign securities that Russians could buy with just a few clicks through domestic brokerage apps before the war in Ukraine  the NSD acted merely as an intermediary. The securities themselves were held mainly at two European depositories: Belgium's Euroclear and Luxembourg's Clearstream.Nemtsova thinks the current proceedings to reclaim foreign assets by private Russians helps them cling to their wealth Image: Odd Anderson/AFP/Getty ImagesMany Russian investors only realized how the custody system worked in the spring of 2022  when they suddenly found themselves unable to carry out transactions. Their securities were frozen just like the Russian state reserves and the assets of individuals and organizations subject to sanctions.Euroclear and Clearstream cut ties with the NSD shortly after the war began in March 2022  in response to the Russian central bank's decision to prohibit Russian brokers from selling securities on behalf of foreign clients.In June  the European Commission legally codified Euroclear's and Clearstream's decisions. The EU's sixth sanctions package included an explicit ban on European entities cooperating with the NSD.How many Russian investors are affected?Neither Russian nor European authorities have published data on the amount of frozen private assets  and the depositories themselves have provided no figures. Only the total value of frozen assets in Europe is known  including the Russian state reserves  which account for the bulk of the total.According to news agency Reuters  the total stands at around €210 billion ($243 billion)  of which €185 billion are held by Euroclear.Russian authorities estimate that the worldwide frozen assets of Russian legal entities and individuals amount to about 5.7 trillion rubles — equaling roughly €12 billion at current exchange rates — about 20% of which belonging to private individuals.What should the EU do with frozen Russian assets? To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoThe exact number of investors is also unknown. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has cited 3.5 million people  while central bank representatives say the number is closer to 5 million.The discrepancy may be due to the higher estimate including not only direct holders of foreign securities but also those who invested indirectly  for example through investment funds.In broken down figures  the average frozen amount per investor comes to around €2 400.A Russian broker told Zhanna Nemtsova that most of his clients have about that amount frozen — around 200 000 rubles  or a little more than two average monthly Russian salaries.How can investors reclaim their assets?Investors can try to recover their assets if they are not on sanctions lists. To do so  they must obtain a license from Belgium's Finance Ministry  which regulates Euroclear. If the assets are frozen at Clearstream  they must apply to the financial authorities in Luxembourg.All Russian transactions involving foreign securities were conducted through Euroclear (pictured) or Clearstream Image: Werner Lerooy/ImagoIn practice  however  doing this without legal assistance is almost impossible. Moreover  the legal costs usually far exceed the average value of the frozen assets.According to Nemtsova  one investor who managed to secure the release of his funds from both Euroclear and Clearstream said the process cost him €60 000.Aleksey Klimyuk  senior investment adviser at Moscow-based asset management company Alfa Capital  told DW that in a first step an attorney must find a ""guarantor or serve as one.""The guarantor must then confirm that the applicant owns the assets  is not under sanctions and that no sanctioned person benefits from the transaction for which the license is being requested.In addition  the applicant must have an investment account in the EU  Switzerland  the UK or the US  since transfers to accounts in Russia are not permitted. Without a residence permit  opening such an account is impossible.According to the news platform Brussels Signal  Belgium received 1 214 license applications last year  of which 232 were approved. Most applicants were investors with dual citizenship — Russian and another European nationality.""You might think I'm defending the interests of the rich  but I'm not "" said Nemtsova. ""The current process actually protects their interests. What I want is to make them [funds] more accessible.""What are the prospects for those affected?According to Nemtsova  the first step is to draw public attention to the problem  as European officials often fail to ""grasp the full consequences of their sanctions policies"" and that the issue is scarcely covered in European media.As a next step  she proposes taking inventory of all frozen assets to determine which belong to private investors not on sanctions lists. After that  authorities in Belgium and Luxembourg should design a simplified procedure for investors who cannot afford expensive lawyers.Nemtsova admitted that only people with Western residence permits or citizenship would likely benefit from such changes. Everyone else will probably have to wait until the war ends and sanctions are eventually lifted.The fate of the Russian central bank's frozen assets is in the hands of the European Commission. When asked by DW whether the EU executive is also considering the future of private investors' assets  a Commission representative declined to comment  saying in a statement only that this was a ""hypothetical scenario.""Relaxing the rules on frozen assets is difficult  as it would require cooperation between the EU and the US Image: Daniel Torok/White House/ZUMA/picture allianceEven though the details of the frozen assets have not been disclosed  it's clear they mainly consist of American securities popular among Russian investors.According to broker data reviewed by DW at the end of 2021  the most sought-after shares were those of US companies Alphabet  Apple  Boeing  Intel  MetaTrader  Microsoft and Tesla  as well as the Chinese firms Alibaba and Baidu.To release US-based assets  a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department is required. OFAC has sanctioned both the Moscow Exchange and the NSD. According to lawyers representing Russian investors  as reported by the Russian news outlet RBC  OFAC has not yet issued a single such license.This article was originally written in Russian.Correction  October 25  2025: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Zhanna Nemtsova.

Oct. 24  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with ca…,PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Oct. 24  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced updates to the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development program.Nanobiotix has completed the transfer of NANORAY-312 sponsorship  initiated in 3Q2024  in the majority of regions along with the transfer of full operational control of the Phase 3 clinical trial to Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”). Following the transfer and Nanobiotix analysis of the latest information  Nanobiotix estimates that NANORAY-312 interim data will be analyzed and reported  after both the requisite number of events have been observed and the last patient has been recruited  in 1H2027.Future guidance related to NANORAY-312 and other JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)-related J&J-sponsored studies will be communicated by J&J. Nanobiotix will continue to provide JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development updates and guidance related to Nanobiotix-sponsored studies as well as studies sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Their complementary profiles combine strategic vision  technical expertise and hands-on leadership.Their appointment reflects the Board’s determination to strengthen managerial proximity and accelerate the Company’s transformation in an increasingly demanding market environment.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes.

Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people.

The Professional and Consumer businesses both delivered robust margins.Our OEM business has faced reduced demand and price pressure  as well as the anticipated impact of two major customers. The Conventional business declined as anticipated  with an additional impact from a manufacturing site rationalization.Based on a softer than expected US market and further demand compression in the OEM business  we expect a comparable sales growth of -2.5 to -3.0%  or -1.0 to -1.5% excluding Conventional  an adjusted EBITA margin of 9.1-9.6%  and free cash flow generation around 7% of sales.Looking ahead  we will focus on commercial and supply chain excellence  continuing to invest and leverage the full potential of our digital and AI capabilities  while maintaining our established cost and capital discipline.

Sales held up well in Europe  except in France  where they were down. In North America  the situation remains difficult: falling commodity prices and rising input costs are weighing on farmers' morale. The 2025 harvests are at very high levels in North America.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING -21.7%In the fourth quarter  all product categories – new machines  used machines and spare parts – posted decreases  with a more marked decline in sales of used machines. As anticipated  volumes were affected in Europe  where cultivated areas are decreasing  and in North America  where the general wait-and-see attitude persists.LEISURE +8.6%Sales remained robust over the fourth quarter  despite a gloomy September in the United Kingdom. Business grew in the fourth quarter  with an increase in sales in the United Kingdom and in Southern Europe. Revenue in France remained stable.INDUSTRY -7.4%Industrial Spraying revenue was down 7.4% over the fourth quarter  with contrasting trends depending on the region: a return to growth in Asia and France  while the European market held up well despite a slight decline. The Americas region  meanwhile  was down compared to the previous fourth quarter  following the delivery of major projects in 2024.Annual revenue 2024–2025In 2024–2025  EXEL Industries' revenue amounted to €983 million  down 10.6%  representing a 9.6% decline at constant scope and foreign exchange rates.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING -19.9%The 2024–2025 fiscal year was marked by a significant slowdown in Agricultural Spraying  with revenue down 19.9% compared to the previous year. This change reflects the increased caution of farmers  after two years of strong business. Distributors focused their efforts on lowering their inventory levels  limiting their orders for new machines throughout the year. All geographical areas are concerned  with particularly difficult market conditions in Australia and North America  where the wait-and-see attitude has been accentuated under the effect of lower commodity prices  higher input costs and persistent uncertainty surrounding the US administration's pricing policies. Sales of spare parts and used machines held up better than other categories  without offsetting the general decline.In Europe  the agricultural spraying market is gradually recovering  with new orders rebounding over the past six months. On the other hand  the North American market remains at low levels.SUGAR BEET HARVESTING -12.9%Sales in Sugar Beet Harvesting fell 12.9% over the 2024–2025 fiscal year. This decline is mainly due to the decrease in cultivated areas in Western Europe and lower volumes in Eastern Europe  combined with the wait-and-see attitude in North America. Sales of spare parts remained stable  but volumes of new and used machines fell  leading to an overall contraction in the activity's revenue.LEISURE +5.6%The Garden activity grew steadily throughout the 2024–2025 fiscal year. Sales increased in the main regions  notably in the United Kingdom  where the season was favorable and weather conditions supported demand. In France  sales remained stable. Watering products performed particularly well in Southern Europe.INDUSTRY -0.7%Industrial Spraying experienced stable overall growth during the fiscal year  with contrasting growth phases depending on the region and product range. Sales were strong in electrostatic and high viscosity applications and in projects  notably in France and the Americas. Western Europe showed signs of slowing down at the end of the fiscal year  while Asia  which was slightly down at the start of the year  regained a positive momentum over the fourth quarter. Technical Hoses maintain stable volumes.Daniel Tragus  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group""As anticipated last year  the 2024–2025 fiscal year was marked by a slowdown in volumes in our agricultural activities  against a backdrop of widespread caution and of a wait-and-see attitude.EXEL Industries was able to rely on the solidity of its Garden and Industry activities to buoy revenue. The complementary nature of our business lines allowed our Group  once again  to offset the less favorable cycles experienced by certain sectors.""Upcoming eventsDecember 18  2025  before market opening: 2024–2025 full-year results & presentationbefore market opening: 2024–2025 full-year results & presentation January 28  2026   before market opening: Q1 2025-2026 revenue  before market opening: Q1 2025-2026 revenue February 4  2026: Annual General MeetingAbout EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for over 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive  and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.In 2024–2025  EXEL Industries generated €983 million in revenue and employed 3 759 people in around thirty countries  on five continents.Euronext Paris  SRD Long only – compartment B (Mid Cap) EnterNext© PEA-PME 150 index (symbol: EXE/ISIN FR0004527638)Press release available on www.exel-industries.comDaniel TRAGUSChief Executive Officer Guillaume JACQGroup Chief Financial Officer / Investor relations direction.communication@exel-industries.comAttachment",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.15,0.5,True,English,"['EXEL Industries', 'Full-year', '2025 revenue', 'foreign exchange rates', 'falling commodity prices', 'rising input costs', 'higher input costs', 'past six months', 'previous four quarters', 'SUGAR BEET HARVESTING', 'lower commodity prices', 'high viscosity applications', 'difficult agricultural context', 'difficult market conditions', 'favorable base effect', 'North American market', 'stable overall growth', 'contrasting growth phases', 'EXEL Industries Group', 'agricultural spraying market', 'previous fourth quarter', 'The Garden activity', 'Industrial Spraying revenue', 'The Americas region', 'European market', 'contrasting trends', 'overall contraction', 'weather conditions', 'previous year', 'high basis', 'high levels', 'same period', 'constant scope', 'product categories', 'spare parts', 'United Kingdom', 'significant slowdown', 'two years', 'inventory levels', 'persistent uncertainty', 'US administration', 'pricing policies', 'other categories', 'other hand', 'low levels', 'main regions', 'Watering products', 'product range', 'positive momentum', '2024–2025 fiscal year', 'last year', 'lower volumes', 'sharp decline', 'marked decline', 'slight decline', 'geographical areas', 'general decline', 'cultivated areas', 'Southern Europe', 'Western Europe', 'Eastern Europe', 'Q4 revenue', 'Annual revenue', ""farmers' morale"", 'major projects', 'strong business', 'Group sales', 'general wait', 'gloomy September', 'new orders', 'Industry activities', 'new machines', 'see attitude', '9.6% decline', '2025 revenue', 'Full-year', 'July', 'LFL', 'LEISURE', 'October', 'comparison', 'France', 'situation', '2025 harvests', 'used', 'decreases', 'increase', 'return', 'Asia', 'delivery', 'caution', 'Distributors', 'efforts', 'Australia', 'season', 'demand', 'electrostatic', 'signs', 'start']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,globenewswire.com

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In September  Volta Finance achieved a net performance of +0.3% bringing year-to-date performance to +3.5%. This performance can be compared with US High Yield and Euro High Yield which respectively returned +7.1%*** and +4.6% over the same period and Morningstar Leveraged Loan indices which returned +4.6%*** in the US and +3.6% in Europe.Global markets showed resilience. US equities posted robust gains  driven by investments in artificial intelligence and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve  which did occur. In fixed income  yields increased early in the month with long-term rates in France and Germany reaching multi-year highs. However  volatility remained contained and broader market stability persisted. UK gilts advanced ahead of the Autumn Budget on fiscal considerations  then stabilized as softer US payroll data reinforced expectations for monetary easing. The Federal Reserve delivered its first rate cut in nine months - a pivotal moment - while the ECB and Bank of England maintained a cautious stance. Fitch’s downgrade of France’s credit rating  driven by political factors  was largely anticipated by markets. Inflation remained a key focus but positive economic data in the US and in Europe supported a constructive outlook.In the loan and CLO markets  refinancings activity was strong with Morningstar LSTA US & European LL Indices closing nearly unchanged at 97.10% / 97.00% price respectively. In fact  stable loan prices with low level of new money loan issuance supported elevated CLO supply in both regions in the form of resets. Still  at the end of the quarter  news around First Brands  a loan issuer representing c.20bps exposure in both US and European leveraged loan markets  triggered some concerns among CLO investors. Putting aside that we believe in the need to be highly selective in this environment  as far as Volta is concerned  First Brands represents less than 10bps of its aggregated underlying loan portfolio.During the month  Volta reinvested c.10m EUR into 5 different US and European BB and B CLO debts with an average margin above base rate north of 675bps and an average price close to par. This reduced the company’s cash position from 18% down to 16%. September is a usual quite month for CLO distributions  resulting in stable interest and coupons generation over the past six months (about €28m equivalent  or c.21% of September NAV on an annualized basis).Over the month  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned +0.3%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +1.2% performance**. The EUR/USD move to 1.1757 from 1.1702 had a -0.05% negative impact on Volta performance given our long dollar exposure (12%).As of end of September 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €272.6m  i.e. €7.45 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 3.60% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.06% as at 31 August 2025  3.46% as at 31 July 2025  0.07% as at 30 June 2025.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** These figures are presented in USD.

Yesterday was a fine day for journalism  because as you understand  we live for fun  tension  and gossip. Anyway  no worries—we’re not about to turn into Switzerland. We’re starting to resemble… Taiwan  not because of the climate  but because of what’s happening in Parliament—and a few meters down the road  at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.Now you see the priest  now you don’t…I think that with the issue of the guarding and maintenance of the “Unknown Soldier” we’re playing a little game of find the queen. Haris  after saying inside the Pentagon building during his meeting with Dendias something like  “My legal advisors told me that based on the amendment and what we heard in Parliament  the government is responsible for cleaning the monument—we’re not taking it on ” made a graceful exit. And of course  to show he’s with the Left bloc (and the “tinfoil-hat crowd”)  he publicly wished them “good luck” and called it a day. Dendias  who is indeed… on the Right  but also a bit of a camper in Routsi (and who  by the way  lost his way and ended up at the Hotel Grande Bretagne instead of Parliament on the crucial day of the amendment debate)  issued yesterday a statement drier than Tinos oregano (God help us). In it  he mentioned that Doukas also shares responsibility—only thing is  the mayor doesn’t know it. In the end  the management issue of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier will probably be solved… in the dictionaries. “Care (as the amendment says) and cleaning ” they note at the Defense Ministry  “are not exactly synonyms in Modern Greek.” So  who’s going to clean the “Unknown Soldier”? Apparently  some cleaning company—because it’s a bit unlikely that the conscripts will be doing spring cleaning. If you ask me  throw in a security company too and let’s call it a day!Kostis’ appointment and Tsiaras’ joint ministerial decisionThe final uphill stretch has begun for OPEKEPE  and yesterday in Brussels Vice President Hatzidakis had a crucial meeting with the head of the Commission’s DG Agri  Elisabeth Werner. The mood is described as positive and progress has been noted  but we’re not done yet. We’re entering a very critical 15-day period that will practically decide everything. By November 4  Greece must present to the Commission a reliable management and control system (OSDE) for agricultural subsidies  a credible registry of farmland  and a trustworthy record of the country’s livestock. Note that strict criteria will be set here for livestock  while in the coming days a Joint Ministerial Decision (JMD) by Tsiaras is pending  which will once again define what constitutes grazing land—and I understand there will be plenty of grumbling. If all that is done  by the end of November the necessary inspections must be completed and the advance payment of farmers’ basic aid for 2025 must be made. By December  the law abolishing OPEKEPE and transferring its powers to the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) must be passed.The water meetingFinal decisions by K.M. on the issue of water and drought are approaching. I hear that this afternoon a meeting will be held at M.M. on the matter  with the main concern being the need for immediate measures to deal with the problem in Attica  as well as in other “red zones” like Chalkidiki  the islands  etc. Practically speaking  the government is shelving the idea of merging the various water companies and is instead moving toward tackling the problem region by region  through immediate actions and projects. At this meeting  a decision may also be taken on whether to add a small temporary surcharge of 2–3 euros on water bills—but that’s a Mitsotakis-level decision. Participants include  of course  Vice President Hatzidakis  from the Environment Ministry Papastavrou and Secretary General Varelidis  senior EYDAP executives  etc. And soon enough  we’ll all be dancing the rain dance…Al-Sisi’s complimentsGiven the intense diplomatic activity surrounding the agreement on the Sinai Monastery  let me tell you that the night before last in Brussels  at the EU–Egypt dinner  K.M. had a brief tête-à-tête with Egyptian President Al-Sisi  who was the guest of honor. In fact  Al-Sisi—whose relationship with K.M. is quite solid—praised Greece during his remarks  thanking it for its mediating role in the signing of Egypt’s Strategic Partnership with the EU.The Parliament “mute button” and the Champions League–style directionNow  let’s move on to Parliament’s little delights. Zoe has drawn her weapon and is firing in all directions. I don’t know if her uncontrollable parliamentary spinning out is due to polls suggesting she’ll be flanked by a possible Tsipras party and a potential Karystianos movement—or to the Speaker’s decision to cut her mic in the Plenary. It’s true that everyone abuses their speaking time  but it’s equally true that Zoe takes it to another level. She speaks whenever she wants  about whatever she wants  and most importantly  for as long as she wants. In other words  she treats the Plenary as a proper TV studio—or an arena  with herself ready to devour anyone who dares oppose her. But that’s just how Zoe has always been. So  President Nikitas finally decided to do the obvious. Everyone will get the time they’re entitled to under the Rules  plus a 25% grace period  and then the mic will be cut. The director’s camera will switch from the speaker to a wide shot of the chamber—just like in football matches when fans storm the pitch and the camera cuts to the pigeons!Zoe  Dora  the chair  the phone  and the hysteriaOf course  that didn’t sit well with Konstantopoulou. It annoyed her. She believed that the “mute button” was aimed solely at silencing her. She was so irritated that yesterday I honestly felt sorry for anyone who had to face her. First up was Dora Bakoyannis  against whom Zoe unleashed hell and high water—she even brought up Christoforakos of Siemens fame. Dora  of course  handled the attack calmly—perhaps even a little playfully. She stood up from her chair  turned it around  and sat facing her accuser. At that very moment  Zoe decided it would be clever to pick up her phone and start filming her. Since the session wasn’t being recorded by cameras  she had to find a way to broadcast her struggle against the establishment to her audience. “That’s unacceptable. Put your phone down now ” Olga Gerovasili of SYRIZA is said to have protested—only to receive an attack from Konstantopoulou herself. And somewhere amid the chaos and general mess  Dora turned her chair back around  turned her back on Zoe  and shouted loudly: “She’s hysterical!”Uninvited to the wedding?Famellos made a 180-degree turn in yesterday’s session  contradicting all his previous statements about Tsipras’s resignation. Not that he suddenly had a change of heart after the former prime minister’s big exit  but the reason obviously lies in the latest polls  where SYRIZA is flirting with… statistical error levels  with the prospect of a Tsipras party on the horizon. As for this supposed “alignment” (or is it “clinginess”?)  I’m not sure how convenient it is for Tsipras  since people will just say  “Same old Manolis  different clothes.” They look more like uninvited guests at the wedding to me.The Hatzivasileiou presenceIt shouldn’t go unnoticed that K.M. had Tasos Hatzivasileiou by his side in Brussels  who is the Secretary for International Relations of New Democracy. The former Deputy Foreign Minister  who resigned after his name was implicated in the European Public Prosecutor’s investigation into OPEKEPE  remains close to the Prime Minister’s circle and in steady contact with K.M. And don’t throw that detail away—it may matter later.Euronext gets a “bonus”: 20% of the Energy ExchangeEuronext  with the public offer it submitted for the Hellenic Exchanges (EXAE) and assuming—as everything indicates—that it gains control of EXAE  will get as a “bonus” along with the Athens Stock Exchange  the 20% stake in the Energy Exchange. The ASE currently holds 20% of it  while the rest belongs to other shareholders  including the EBRD. Euronext doesn’t hide its intentions—it clearly states in its prospectus that both clearing and settlement (that is  its subsidiaries EL.KAT and ETEK) will be transferred in 2029 to Euronext’s Italian subsidiary that provides those services. As for the public offer  the balance remains unchanged  with attention focused on the group of funds around Praude  which have decided to keep their shares in EXAE. Of course  the question is what sense that makes  given that Euronext  as the main shareholder  will have the right to make decisions regarding the subsidiaries (as it explicitly notes in its prospectus)  and therefore to influence the valuation of EXAE group’s assets.The Germans decide on the purchase of 80% of ACSTime is ticking down toward the first of the two deadlines in the deal for the sale of 80% of ACS by the Quest Group to the German General Logistics Systems (GLS)  part of IDS – International Distribution Services. The market is awaiting news  since around this time last year the agreement for the sale of 20% of ACS to GLS for €74 million was announced. Under the terms of the deal  GLS holds a call option to buy the remaining 80% of ACS shares within one or two years—either on October 31  2025  or October 31  2026—for a pre-agreed minimum price of €296 million. Just a few days before the first deadline expires  Quest Group sources repeated the same line as before: “There’s nothing new yet.” Since the final date for possible developments is at the end of October  they continue to defer to decisions and announcements from the new shareholders’ side. However  there’s a general sense in the market that developments are coming—but obviously the ball is in the Germans’ court. Their choices are clear: either exercise the call option by the end of this month or next October for the minimum price of €296 million  or ultimately decide not to proceed with the purchase of the 80%. Note that in such a case  a buyback right of the 20% stake by Quest has been foreseen through another pre-agreed mechanism. The money involved is huge—a sum capable of taking Quest Group’s liquidity to another level. The original agreement  remember  valued the company at €370 million overall. While awaiting developments  ACS continues its investment plan  focusing on expanding its smartpoint locker network—with a goal of surpassing 60 000 lockers this year and reaching 120 000 by 2026.Bank of Cyprus vs. JUMBOHigh expectations have been placed on the new MSCI index reshuffling on November 5. Some are watching the “battle for the top ten” in our market’s capitalization rankings. Currently  in 10th place by market cap is JUMBO (€3.63 billion)  which  however  has lost over 14% of its value over the past month. In contrast  Bank of Cyprus (€3.46 billion) has gained ground  increasing its market value by one-fifth over the last quarter. Yesterday it rose by +2.31% to €7.96. Close behind is the Athens International Airport (€3.12 billion)  which by its nature isn’t expected to make major upward moves (yesterday +0.30% to €10.10). Today  the MSCI Standard Greece Index includes nine listed companies: National Bank  Piraeus Bank  Alpha Bank  Eurobank  OTE  Metlen  OPAP  Jumbo  and PPC.Tight marking from the Capital Market CommissionMany executives from auditing firms crossed the threshold of the Capital Market Commission yesterday. These were the professionals tasked with assessing the internal audit activities of listed companies for the period from January 1  2023  to December 31  2025. This assessment requirement is part of the corporate governance legislation  and the Commission invited the evaluators to brief them on its findings so far regarding listed companies and to prepare them for the contents of the reports they’ll have to produce. The Commission has begun close monitoring of listed firms  as on October 21 all their CFOs and certified auditors received a letter outlining the common European supervisory priorities set by ESMA for the 2025 financial statements. Among other things  priority is given to geopolitical risks and uncertainties  with information required by sector—including turnover data and major clients by geographic region  among others.Abusive practices by funds that bought NPLs-Complaints are multiplying about abusive practices by the funds that purchase packages of “non-performing loans.” The process these funds follow is to “mature” the loans (meaning they initiate certain enforcement actions) and then sell them on—with a small profit—to other funds that handle the recovery process  until another buyer comes along to take over the next stage  and so on. Lately  however  it seems some have really tightened the screws. Greek and foreign funds have bought loan portfolios at prices far lower than the outstanding amounts owed. Having acquired them under such favorable terms  they now contact the borrowers (who  for the banks  are considered “green ” since the funds took over the loans) and urge them—aggressively  even coercively in some cases—to go to a bank  take out a new loan  and use it to repay the old one. They demand full repayment of 100% of the outstanding debt—of course  not at the value they paid when they bought the package. Borrowers complain that these funds refuse to recognize previous restructuring agreements  refuse to negotiate loan terms  reject any proposal for an extension  and the only “offer” they make is a 10% discount if the borrower pays off the debt in a lump sum. Thus  the “red” borrower ends up back in the Greek banking system as a new debtor—with the new loan they took to repay the old one. The funds  meanwhile  are completely freed from risk and—above all—reap windfall profits from a claim they bought for a fraction of its value. The phenomenon is not isolated. If it continues at scale  it will reintroduce into the banking system a problem once thought to have been “transferred off the books”—with only the middlemen walking away as winners.Pappas invests in containerships—but not Petros-Word spread in shipping circles that Petros Pappas might be returning to the containership business  seven years after his last involvement. I looked into it and found that’s not exactly the case. The move and investment come from Milena Pappas  Petros’s daughter. Conditions are currently favorable for small-capacity feeder container vessels—those carrying between 1 000 and 8 000 boxes—and the Greek shipowner is acting in good time. Through Oceanbulk  she’s in talks with the Chinese shipyard Zhoushan Changhong for two feeder vessels of 3 100 TEU capacity. Sources say the deal isn’t finalized yet  as a few details remain to be ironed out. Petros Pappas’s last involvement with containerships dates back about a decade  through Oceanbulk Container Carriers  a joint venture with the American investment group Oaktree Capital Management. That company had a fleet of large 10 000–11 000 TEU vessels—eight ships and seven more on order by 2016. By 2018  the fleet had evaporated  as ships were sold or converted into bulk carriers and joined the Star Bulk fleet. The potential Zhoushan Changhong deal would place Oceanbulk among the companies that have been ordering feeder vessels in recent months. In the same category are established players like Lou Kollakis’s Chartworld Shipping  Aristides Pittas’s Euroseas  and Costis Konstantakopoulos’s Costamare—as well as companies returning to the sector after years away  such as Andreas Martinos Jr.’s Minerva Dry  Yannis Sarantitis’s W Marine  and Konstantinos Karoussis’s Chios Navigation.Maria Angelicoussis leads the anti-IMO bloc-The stance of tycoon Maria Angelicoussis drew particular attention behind the scenes of the recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) talks on the industry’s transition strategy toward zero carbon emissions. The head of the Angelicoussis Group is said to have played a key role—even influencing Greece’s decision to back the motion for the Organization not to proceed  for now  with new measures or commitments. As the Greek shipowner repeatedly argued  several of the proposed regulations would have led to unfair treatment of LNG. According to Angelicoussis—who led a group of prominent Greek and foreign shipowners  forming an anti-IMO bloc—LNG is a transitional but necessary fuel for the shipping industry’s gradual move to zero carbon emissions. She stressed that overburdening shipowners using LNG would send the wrong message to the market  as it would make more polluting fuels  like conventional heavy fuel oil  more cost-effective—discouraging investment in cleaner alternatives. The IMO’s decision to delay adopting the zero-emission framework and the carbon pricing mechanism was welcomed by many Greek shipowners. The Greek-owned fleet has invested heavily in dual-fuel vessels  primarily LNG as a secondary fuel  and any hasty regulation could undermine those investments. Data from classification societies Lloyd’s Register and DNV confirm that nearly two-thirds of all new ships ordered last year capable of using alternative fuels opted for LNG. The reasons are practical: the fuel already has technological maturity  widespread refueling infrastructure  and—even if limited—offers emission reductions compared to traditional fuels.Greek shipowners on a buying spree-Confirming the strong appetite of Greek shipowners for modern vessels  Alberta Shipmanagement S.A.  owned by Nikolaos Inglêsis  placed an order for two 1 900 TEU feeder containerships—with two additional options—at the Huangpu Wenchong shipyard in China  strengthening Greece’s steady presence in the newbuild container sector. Greek shipowners are moving fast in ship sales and purchases. The Kollakis family’s Chartworld Maritime Management bought the Bastions (119 000 dwt  2011  Sanoyas) for $16.5 million  while a Greek buyer is linked to the purchase of Xiang Hang 57 (63 500 dwt  built 2025  Sainty Shipbuilding)  reflecting ongoing interest in Tier III eco Ultramax vessels. In the tanker segment  Metrostar Management Corp. sold its sister Suezmax crude tankers Crude Levante and Crude Zephyrus (156 800 dwt each  built 2021 at New Times Shipbuilding) for $78 million apiece—one of the largest Greek deals of the week. In the Handysize category  Arion Shipping S.A. sold Mastro Mitros for $6.9 million  capping off a particularly active period of Greek transactions across all ship sizes. Over the past twelve months  Greek shipowners have placed 97 newbuild orders and purchased 174 secondhand vessels—maintaining their dominant position in the global shipping market.The banking duopoly  new highs for Viohalco  and Jumbo’s block trades-The stock market balanced yesterday between Alpha Bank and National Bank of Greece. On one side  Alpha Bank got a double boost—first from its green bond  which smashed expectations with demand hitting €3 billion while the bank aimed to raise €500 million; and second from UBS  which reaffirmed its confidence in the stock  maintaining a “buy” rating with a target price of €4. Alpha Bank has now logged four consecutive gains  climbing to €3.60 and closing in on its yearly high of €3.80. On the other hand  National Bank plunged nearly 3%—its worst session in two months—abruptly ending the three-day rally that preceded it. Viohalco scaled new heights  closing for the first time above €8.20 with gains of 1.85%. It had previously touched €8.30 intraday on October 8 and 13. Even better was the group’s other stock  Cenergy  which jumped more than 3% to close at €13.86—a new all-time high—setting course for €14. GEK TERNA returned above €23  flirting with yearly highs  with the next comparable levels dating back over 25 years (January 2000). PPC (Public Power Corporation) is quietly edging toward new records  with four straight positive sessions—three of them modestly under 1%—reaching €14.72. Its yearly high is €14.79  and it hasn’t seen €15 since November 2009. Jumbo also drew attention  closing yesterday at €27.06—a six-month low. The drop came alongside heavy block-trade activity  with shares changing hands above the closing price. Specifically  on Thursday  six blocks worth a total of €13.22 million traded between €27.26 and €27.35 per share.Are we in 1996  1998  or October 1999?-For Greek investors  the stock market bubble burst in September 1999—with the well-known aftermath. For the rest of the world  the global bubble popped in March–April 2000  triggering a seismic shock in the world economy six months later. During just that six-month period  the Nasdaq index doubled—posting +100% gains. Looking at today’s valuations in stocks  precious metals  bonds  cryptocurrencies  commodities  housing  and virtually every asset class  analysts reasonably wonder: what phase of the bubble are we in? The beginning (1996)  the middle (1998)  or the final months? So far  every major market correction has proven to be a “golden opportunity” to re-enter and profit again. One big difference between then and now  though  is that today central banks are lowering the cost of money—while back then they were raising interest rates to “protect” their currencies. The fact remains: the whole planet is gambling. Whether it’s stocks  sports betting  or prediction markets (like guessing who’ll win the Oscars)  everyone’s chasing short-term gains—simply because there’s liquidity. People aren’t buying because they believe in value  but because they know they’ll find someone to sell to. The question is—until when?Great personal sacrifices by Americans for a roof over their heads-Redfin  a major American real estate and tech company with online platforms for buying  selling  and renting homes—and one of the leading digital players in the U.S. housing market—released new data yesterday revealing a wave of housing insecurity that’s bringing to light hidden family sacrifices and upheavals in Americans’ everyday lives. According to Redfin’s latest numbers  5.3% of Americans  unable to make ends meet  decided to move in with a new partner just to share housing costs. The pressure isn’t limited to couples: 6.4% moved back in with their parents  while 6.2% chose to live with other family members. The extended family has become a survival strategy in modern America. Another 5.7% moved in with friends or roommates. But there’s also the other side of the coin: 2.8% of those struggling financially have postponed a divorce or separation simply because they can’t afford to live alone. Equally telling: 4.4% have reduced or sacrificed their children’s college savings  while 4% have decided not to have children at all. Austerity-hit America—with its high indirect taxes and cuts to public spending—has pushed personal choices into “bare survival mode.”Chinese games with gold-After the steep drop of recent days  the price of gold rebounded above $2 153 per ounce. The spark for the rebound came from the Shanghai Gold Warrants market. These “gold certificates” in Shanghai—rights to purchase physical gold—have now soared to a record 86 565 kilograms this week  marking a staggering +570% increase in 2025—or  if you prefer  28 times more than in 2024. Gold Warrants on the Shanghai Futures Exchange are digital certificates proving ownership of physical gold stored in an exchange-approved vault. Simply put  Chinese investors have bought and stored 28 times more gold than they did last year. It’s now clear that China is “building” the de-dollarization of its transactions  using gold as its foundation.,negative,0.02,0.16,0.83,mixed,0.26,0.28,0.46,True,English,"['Champions League–style system', 'little Zoe', 'Tsipras’ place', 'Haris', 'Nikos', 'priest', 'Parliament', 'Dora', 'sweet', 'SYRIZA', 'Champions League–style direction', 'Brussels Vice President Hatzidakis', 'Tsiaras’ joint ministerial decision', 'Hotel Grande Bretagne', 'critical 15-day period', 'farmers’ basic aid', 'small temporary surcharge', 'Secretary General Varelidis', 'senior EYDAP executives', 'intense diplomatic activity', 'uncontrollable parliamentary spinning', 'possible Tsipras party', 'potential Karystianos movement', 'proper TV studio', 'final uphill stretch', 'other “red zones', 'Environment Ministry Papastavrou', 'various water companies', 'Egyptian President Al-Sisi', 'EU–Egypt dinner', 'Defense Ministry', 'Final decisions', 'other words', 'Mitsotakis-level decision', 'fine day', 'Unknown Soldier', 'little game', 'Pentagon building', 'legal advisors', 'graceful exit', 'Left bloc', 'hat crowd', 'crucial day', 'Tinos oregano', 'Modern Greek', 'security company', 'Kostis’ appointment', 'DG Agri', 'Elisabeth Werner', 'reliable management', 'control system', 'agricultural subsidies', 'credible registry', 'trustworthy record', 'strict criteria', 'coming days', 'grazing land', 'necessary inspections', 'advance payment', 'Independent Authority', 'Public Revenue', 'K.M.', 'M.M.', 'main concern', 'immediate measures', 'immediate actions', 'water bills', 'rain dance', 'Sinai Monastery', 'tête', 'mediating role', 'Strategic Partnership', 'mute button', 'little delights', 'speaking time', 'cleaning company', 'spring cleaning', 'crucial meeting', 'water meeting', 'amendment debate', 'management issue', 'Newsroom', 'Yesterday', 'journalism', 'fun', 'tension', 'gossip', 'worries', 'Switzerland', 'Taiwan', 'climate', 'road', 'Tomb', 'priest', 'guarding', 'maintenance', 'queen', 'Haris', 'Dendias', 'something', 'government', 'monument', 'tinfoil', 'Right', 'bit', 'camper', 'Routsi', 'way', 'statement', 'God', 'Doukas', 'responsibility', 'mayor', 'dictionaries', 'Care', 'conscripts', 'OPEKEPE', 'head', 'Commission', 'mood', 'progress', 'everything', 'November', 'Greece', 'OSDE', 'farmland', 'country', 'livestock', 'JMD', 'plenty', 'December', 'law', 'powers', 'AADE', 'drought', 'matter', 'need', 'problem', 'Attica', 'Chalkidiki', 'islands', 'idea', 'region', 'projects', '2–3 euros', 'Participants', 'course', 'compliments', 'agreement', 'guest', 'honor', 'fact', 'relationship', 'remarks', 'signing', 'Zoe', 'weapon', 'directions', 'polls', 'Speaker', 'mic', 'Plenary', 'everyone', 'arena']",2025-10-24,2025-10-25,en.protothema.gr
