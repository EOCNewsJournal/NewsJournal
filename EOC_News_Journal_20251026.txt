EU leaders have thus far failed to agree on how to use the funds.The comment came shortly after Belgium Prime Minister Bart De Wever opposed the so-called “reparations loan” scheme under which the EU was planning to raise around €140 billion ($160 billion) to fund Ukraine using Russia’s assets as collateral. The plan entails Moscow eventually paying reparations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement.“Of course  this money will not rebuild Ukraine but will continue the war ” Francken said in a post on X on Friday  adding that war is extremely costly.The minister warned that many EU leaders  led by the bloc’s foreign policy chief  Kaja Kallas  “want to give these assets to Ukraine through a legally questionable structure.” He emphasized that “even during the Second World War  such a dubious confiscation was never carried out.”Belgium  where most of the immobilized assets – estimated at around $300 billion – are housed at the clearinghouse Euroclear  has voiced concern over the risks the plan entails. De Wever has set three conditions for backing the loan  one of which is that the potential risks be shared  warning that otherwise he would “do everything” to stop the confiscation.Francken reiterated that the EU proposal undermines trust in institutions such as Euroclear. He also warned that Russia could retaliate by seizing €200 billion ($172 billion) in Western assets  including both movable and immovable property  held in Russia by Belgium and countries such as the US  Germany  and France. The minister stressed that while the confiscation plan had been shelved for now  it could resurface in future discussions.Moscow has repeatedly said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that channeling Russian funds to Ukraine would “boomerang ” adding that “if someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them  they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.”,neutral,0.01,0.54,0.45,negative,0.0,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['frozen funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Russia', 'Belgium', 'Belgium Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'foreign policy chief', 'Belgian Defense Minister', 'Second World War', 'many EU leaders', 'reparations loan” scheme', 'weapon supplies', 'peace settlement', 'Kaja Kallas', 'questionable structure', 'three conditions', 'EU proposal', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'legal prosecution', 'dubious confiscation', 'central-bank assets', 'immobilized assets', 'clearinghouse Euroclear', 'potential risks', 'Western assets', 'immovable property', 'future discussions', 'frozen assets', 'Russian funds', 'Theo Francken', 'Ukraine conflict', 'confiscation plan', 'Moscow', 'country', 'comment', 'collateral', 'part', 'money', 'post', 'Friday', 'bloc', 'concern', 'everything', 'trust', 'institutions', 'countries', 'Germany', 'France', 'theft', 'someone']",2025-10-25,2025-10-26,rt.com

Belgian PM Bart De Wever threatened legal and political resistance unless conditions were met  forcing a watered-down compromise.President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that delays weaken Ukraine's defenses and slow EU progress. Kyiv pledged to spend funds on European weapons and air defenses  but EU leaders postponed final approval until December.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called any seizure ""theft"" and vowed legal retaliation. Russia has already seized Euroclear’s assets in response to sanctions and may escalate if the EU moves forward.Experts warn Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts  destabilizing Western finance. If Russia reclaims assets  the U.S. may default on Ukraine-related loans  accelerating dollar decline.The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance  with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens  with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution.European Union (EU) leaders have delayed plans to use frozen Russian assets to finance a massive €140 billion ($163 billion) loan for Ukraine after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards  throwing negotiations into disarray.The move comes as Russia warns of severe financial and legal repercussions if the West proceeds with what Moscow calls outright ""theft.""At a Brussels summit on Thursday  Oct. 23  EU officials failed to reach an agreement on whether to use immobilized Russian central bank funds as collateral for Ukraine's war effort. Belgium  which holds legal control over the bulk of the frozen assets through Brussels-based Euroclear  insisted that all EU members share responsibility if the plan backfires.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took a firm stance  stating: ""If demands are met  we can go forward. If not  I will do everything in my power at the European level  also at the national level  politically and legally to stop this decision."" His opposition forced a compromise text that merely ""invites the [EU] Commission to present  as soon as possible  options for financial support "" rather than committing to the loan outright.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  attending the summit as a guest  urged immediate approval of the loan  warning that delays would weaken Ukraine's defenses. ""Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense  but also slowing down the EU's own progress "" he said.Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses.However  EU leaders  wary of legal blowback  postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity  stating: ""This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex.""Russia warns of financial and legal repercussionsMoscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds  calling it illegal confiscation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure would ""boomerang"" on the EU  adding: ""If someone wants to steal our property  our assets  and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.""Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance  stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assets—unless the EU moves first.""We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation  so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating  then we will consider it "" he said.According to the Enoch AI engine at BrightU.AI  Russia's stance on the EU's plan to seize frozen Russian assets is one of strong opposition and condemnation  viewing it as a brazen act of theft and a violation of international law. Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy.Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts  potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis  exposing the West's ""theft scheme"" and leaving financial institutions scrambling.Broader implications: A financial and geopolitical quagmireThe stalled EU plan underscores deeper concerns about Ukraine's financial viability. Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default  with 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile  the U.S. faces its own dilemma—if Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets  Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan  accelerating the dollar's decline.As the EU scrambles for a legally defensible solution  the standoff highlights the growing risks of weaponizing finance in geopolitical conflicts. With no clear resolution in sight  the fate of Ukraine's funding—and the stability of Western financial systems—hangs in the balance.The EU's hesitation reveals a stark reality: The West's financial warfare against Russia may carry unforeseen consequences. As legal doubts mount and Moscow prepares its counterstrike  the global financial order teeters on the edge of upheaval—one that could redefine power dynamics far beyond Ukraine's battlefields.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says Russia will not regain frozen assets without paying reparations to Ukraine.
