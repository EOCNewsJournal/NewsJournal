53395,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/ukraine-another-week-of-diplomatic-wrangling-leaves-kyiv-short-of-defensive-options-268023,Ukraine: another week of diplomatic wrangling leaves Kyiv short of defensive options,Despite exhaustive discussions  neither the EU or the US has come up with any really substantial measures to boost Ukraine’s defence.,Following another week of diplomatic flip-flopping in the United States  Ukraine’s European allies did not disappoint when it came to the fulsomeness of their diplomatic rhetoric. Yet concrete action to strengthen the capabilities Ukraine needs to win the war remained at a snail’s pace.After a less than successful meeting in the White House on October 17 between the American and Ukrainian presidents  Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky  Ukraine and its European allies once again scrambled to respond to US equivocation with public affirmations of support for Kyiv.A meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday October 20  a summit of EU leaders on Thursday October 23  and a gathering of the coalition of the willing on Friday October 24  provided plenty of opportunities for such statements. For good measure  the Nato secretary general  Mark Rutte  paid a visit to Washington on October 21 and 22 before joining the leaders of the coalition of the willing on Friday.The core message from all these meetings was that where the Trump administration sends ambiguous signals  Ukraine’s more steadfast European supporters are still keen to demonstrate their mettle.When they met on Monday in Brussels  EU foreign ministers had a packed agenda. On Ukraine  the EU’s foreign affairs chief  Kaja Kallas  reiterated the bloc’s support for what she described as “Trump’s efforts to end the war” and condemned Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.The following day  Tuesday October 21  brought diplomatic whiplash  when it transpired that there had been another apparent shift in the White House. The Budapest summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart  Vladimir Putin  was postponed until further notice. The supposed host  Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly prime minister  Viktor Orban  and Putin’s spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  maintained that preparations for the meeting were continuing. But Trump was unequivocal. He would not waste time on a meeting if a peace deal was not a realistic prospect.In an unusual moment of clarity  the US president then appeared to realise that he needed to demonstrate actual consequences for Russia obstructing a peace agreement. On October 22 the US announced sanctions on two of Russia’s largest oil companies – Rosneft and Lukoil – the first sanctions package imposed on Russia in Trump’s second term.There is a grace period until November 21 to allow for the necessary winding down of transactions with  and divestment from  the two companies. Nonetheless  the mere announcement of the sanctions has already led to major Indian and Chinese clients beginning to pull out from their deals with Russia’s energy giants. Additional sanctions against the Russian banking sector and companies involved in oil infrastructure are apparently also being contemplated in the White House.After much deliberation to overcome internal divisions  the EU followed suit. On October 23  it announced its 19th package of sanctions against Russia. This also targeted an oil trader and two refineries in China and banks in Central Asia.In addition  the EU confirmed that a decision had been taken on the rules of the transition to a complete ban on any Russian gas imports. This will take full effect at the end of 2027.All these efforts are critical to increasing pressure on Russia and are long overdue. But their immediate effect is uncertain. Russia has responded with the usual performative defiance. It has tested a new nuclear-powered missile and carried out a readiness drill for the country’s nuclear forces  overseen directly by Putin.More help neededWith Russia’s air and ground wars against Ukraine continuing unabated  the other major challenge for Kyiv’s allies is providing assistance.Institute for the Study of WarHere  progress has stalled. The US continues to withhold permission for Ukraine to use long-range missiles against targets deep inside of Russia. The mooted supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine by the US has been scotched. Meeting with coalition leaders on Friday  Zelensky kept pressing for deep-strike weapons  stressing that when the US threatened to supply Tomahawks to Ukraine  Putin was willing to negotiate.Even more pressing is the issue of how to cover Ukraine’s financial needs. Kyiv’s most recent estimate of the country’s unmet external financing needs for 2026-27 stands at US$60 billion (£45 billion).At the European Council meeting on October 23  leaders reiterated their commitment to “continue to provide  in coordination with like-minded partners and allies  comprehensive political  financial  economic  humanitarian  military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people”. However  crucially  no agreement was reached on how the necessary funds would be mobilised.There is strong support for using frozen Russian assets to assist Ukraine  including from the coalition of the willing and the US. A proposal to provide Ukraine with a loan secured by these frozen Russian assets has been around for some time.It has not been finalised due to two major obstacles. The first was Ukraine’s refusal to accept EU conditions that while some of the money could be used to buy weapons  none of the funds should be spent on procuring them from the US. The second  more critical  issue was a demand from Belgium – where most of the frozen Russian assets are held at the Euroclear securities depository – for robust guarantees that the burden for any Russian litigation and retaliation be collectively shared by EU members.Despite all the signalling from the EU’s leadership in the run-up to last week’s gathering in Brussels that these two major obstacles to approving the loan were being overcome  the meeting ended with EU leaders postponing a decision to their next meeting in December.At the end of a week of concentrated attention on Russia’s war against Ukraine  the outcome was therefore a repetition of recent behaviour. The Trump administration flip-flopped and the coalition of the willing produced little more than a statement of intent to continue their support for Ukraine. The track record of Kyiv’s European partners to slow-walk the necessary goods for Ukraine’s defence continues. There’s mounting evidence suggesting that they will not stretch themselves to go beyond securing Ukraine’s immediate survival.Unsurprisingly  a credible pathway to ending the war with a just and stable peace is still lacking.,negative,0.0,0.38,0.62,mixed,0.09,0.22,0.69,True,English,"['diplomatic wrangling', 'defensive options', 'Ukraine', 'week', 'Kyiv', 'unmet external financing needs', 'Nato secretary general', 'foreign affairs chief', 'Kremlin-friendly prime minister', 'usual performative defiance', 'new nuclear-powered missile', 'other major challenge', 'steadfast European supporters', 'necessary winding down', 'Russian banking sector', 'Russian gas imports', 'frozen Russian assets', 'two major obstacles', 'EU foreign ministers', 'Ukrainian energy infrastructure', 'The Budapest summit', 'largest oil companies', 'first sanctions package', 'European Council meeting', 'financial needs', 'oil infrastructure', 'major Indian', 'Ukrainian presidents', 'Russian attacks', 'Russian counterpart', 'energy giants', '19th package', 'necessary funds', 'two companies', 'oil trader', 'two refineries', 'diplomatic flip-flopping', 'United States', 'European allies', 'diplomatic rhetoric', 'concrete action', 'White House', 'public affirmations', 'good measure', 'Mark Rutte', 'core message', 'ambiguous signals', 'packed agenda', 'Kaja Kallas', 'diplomatic whiplash', 'apparent shift', 'Viktor Orban', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'peace deal', 'realistic prospect', 'unusual moment', 'actual consequences', 'second term', 'grace period', 'mere announcement', 'Chinese clients', 'internal divisions', 'Central Asia', 'complete ban', 'full effect', 'immediate effect', 'readiness drill', 'nuclear forces', 'More help', 'ground wars', 'long-range missiles', 'mooted supply', 'Tomahawk missiles', 'deep-strike weapons', 'recent estimate', 'minded partners', 'The US', 'successful meeting', 'Additional sanctions', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'peace agreement', 'diplomatic support', 'strong support', 'US equivocation', 'US president', 'Thursday October', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump administration', 'Vladimir Putin', 'EU leaders', 'Monday October', 'coalition leaders', 'Friday October', 'week', 'Ukraine', 'fulsomeness', 'capabilities', 'snail', 'pace', 'less', 'American', 'Kyiv', 'gathering', 'willing', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'statements', 'visit', 'Washington', 'meetings', 'mettle', 'Brussels', 'bloc', 'efforts', 'notice', 'host', 'Hungary', 'spokesman', 'preparations', 'time', 'clarity', 'Rosneft', 'Lukoil', 'November', 'transactions', 'divestment', 'deals', 'deliberation', 'suit', 'China', 'banks', 'decision', 'rules', 'transition', 'pressure', 'country', 'assistance', 'Institute', 'Study', 'progress', 'permission', 'targets', 'Tomahawks', 'issue', 'commitment', 'coordination', 'military', 'people', 'proposal', 'loan', 'refusal']",2025-10-27,2025-10-28,theconversation.com

Bet…,"PARIS  Oct. 27  2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On October 23 in Paris  the 25th edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize was awarded to Xie Lei  chosen from among four short-listed artists representing the vitality  diversity and international reach of the French scene. Between vulnerability  and metamorphosis  science and poetry  this edition highlighted an art in dialogue with its era.After Frieze London  Art Basel Paris opens its doors at the Grand Palais  while the auction houses unveil their autumn masterpieces.Xie Lei – Copyright Margot Montigny Artprice's 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report cover  featuring the digital work “The Thinking Fiend” by Other WorldMeanwhile  the art world has been celebrating another major event: the award of the Marcel Duchamp Prize  initiated by the ADIAF (Association for the International Diffusion of French Art) and supported by Artprice by Artmarket.The Marcel Duchamp Prize was initiated 25 years ago by a group of French collectors and the ADIAF. It received significant impetus from French collector Gilles Fuchs  who noted a decline in the international reputation of French artists in the 1990s. His motivation was to contribute to a better representation and promotion of French art in a delicate context for the French contemporary art market.This year  the prestigious Prize was awarded to painter Xie Lei  whose paintings occupy a disconcerting space between dreams and reality  inviting us to slow the pace of our visual consumption and rediscover the emotional power of images.Thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  praised ""the creativity  symbolic power and diversity"" of this edition  congratulating the winner Xie Lei as well as finalists Bianca Bondi  Eva Nielsen and Lionel Sabatté  all examples of the wealth of the current French art scene:""Artprice by Artmarket is very proud to support the Association for the International Diffusion of French Art (ADIAF) and the Marcel Duchamp Prize. In a context where Paris is establishing itself as the most dynamic marketplace in the world in terms of the number of contemporary works sold at auction  the Marcel Duchamp Prize fully contributes to the promotion of the French art scene and its influence. This ambition is shared by the Minister of Culture  Madame Rachida Dati  in her new plan to strengthen the French contemporary art scene.""Claude Bonnin  President of ADIAF :""For 25 years  each edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize has been a tribute to the vitality and creativity of the contemporary French art scene. On behalf of the 300 collectors of the ADIAF  I would like to warmly congratulate the winner  Xie Lei. I am delighted with the quality of the Marcel Duchamp Prize exhibition  presented for the first time this year at the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris. This edition exemplifies the superb collective formed by the State  the City of Paris  and the ADIAF around a common objective: to promote the French scene by giving essential visibility to its artists  in France and internationally. I would also like to emphasize that  in addition to this exhibition  the four finalists will benefit from our association's support program  including residencies at the Manufacture de Sèvres and the Villa Albertine as well as exhibitions abroad.""A prize has become a global benchmarkIn a quarter of a century  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has established itself as a major marker of contemporary creation  comparable to the prestigious British Turner Prize and the American Hugo Boss Prize. Supported by the French Ministry of Culture and a number of major public institutions  each year it highlights French or French-domiciled artists whose works embody the vitality  diversity  and quality of the current scene.The winner receives an endowment of €35 000 and support from a museum with a view to enhancing their international visibility  in conjunction with a network of partners such as the French Institute  the Manufacture de Sèvres  national Museums  and the Villa Albertine in the United States.Beyond the financial reward  the ""Prix Marcel Duchamp"" is therefore a substantial recognition accelerator that has already benefited artists like Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Kader Attia  Tatiana Trouvé  Tarik Kiswanson and Melik Ohanian  whose recognitions all extended well beyond French borders after being nominated as winners of the prize.As Claude Bonnin  President of ADIAF: ""The Marcel Duchamp Prize is not intended to reward emerging artists  but to support those with international potential.""This greater visibility naturally translates into the art market  with the winners gaining easier access to museum collections and their galleries benefiting from a stronger sales dynamic. Above all  the Prize confers lasting critical legitimacy  placing their works in the long term  somewhat above the fluctuations of fashion and short-term trends.The 2025 finalistsThe 2025 edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize once again attests to the vitality and diversity of the French scene  bringing together four artists with unique paths and worlds  exploring themes of materiality  memory  and metamorphosis.For Bianca Bondi (born in 1986 in Johannesburg  represented by the gallery Mor Charpentier  Paris)  transformation is a process as poetic as it is spiritual. Her installation Silent House evokes a dwelling suspended between dream and memory: patinated furniture  plants and salt basins are covered in crystals  revealing the living memory of matter and the beauty of the passage of time.- Discover Bianca Bondi on ArtpriceEva Nielsen (born in 1983 in Les Lilas near Paris  represented by the galleries Peter Kilchmann and The Pill) explores the porosity of images and surfaces. A painter-photographer  she layers latex  leather  silk  and screen printing to create fragmented landscapes where the memory of places dissolves into the pictorial texture. Her works invite a stratified interpretation of reality  between figuration and abstraction.- Discover Eva Nielsen on ArtpriceFor Lionel Sabatté (born in 1975 in Toulouse  represented by the Ceysson & Bénétière gallery)  matter becomes memory. True to his practice of collecting – dust  ash  dead skin  tree fragments – this time  the artist has gleaned the residues of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris  to create a new series of dust drawings. Between fragility and mystery  he makes the invisible a tangible presence.- Discover Lionel Sabatté on ArtpriceFinally  Xie Lei (born in 1983 in China  represented in Paris by the Semiose gallery) deploys an introspective style of painting  nourished by literary and cinematographic references. His canvases  bathed in ambiguity  suspend the gaze between dream and reality. Against the current of contemporary celerity  he offers a deceleration of time  a meditation on the persistence of images and the depth of the visible.- Discover Xie Lei on ArtpriceFrom among these diverse approaches – between materiality  memory  and perception – the jury chose to distinguish Xie Lei for the singular strength of his work and the relevance of his reflection on contemporary societal issues.A changing French sceneThe 2025 selection of artists highlights how the French scene is becoming increasingly international while asserting its own identity: a focus on technique  materials  memory and the environment. These artists do not claim to be part of a ""French style"" but rather have adopted a posture of openness  where the boundaries between disciplines and origins are blurred.The ADIAF  true to its original spirit  continues to play a leading role in this dynamic. By organizing more than sixty workshop visits each year across France and abroad  it maintains a dynamic link with creations in progress. This fieldwork feeds into a highly demanding selection process  supported by more than 300 committed art collectors.A 2025 edition marked by a change of venueThis 25th edition has a special significance: for the first time  the exhibition of the nominated artists was held not at the Centre Pompidou  which is currently undergoing renovation for four years  but at the Musée d'Art Moderne of Paris (MAM). This change of setting  far from being anecdotal  was an opportunity to rethink the presentation of the Prize and the exhibition of artists' works. Its curators  Julia Garimorth and Jean-Pierre Criqui  have made every effort to offer a coherent journey through the diversity of the proposals.Fabrice Hergott  Director of the Musée d'Art Moderne of Paris:""Xie Lei's paintings are a particularly accomplished expression for the beginning of the 21st century. Since the September 11  2001 attacks  there has been a general feeling of doubt and vertigo. Lei's work offers a representation that is both concise and captivating  making him one of the most remarkable figures of the new French scene. We are happy to be able to show them at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the 25th prestigious Marcel Duchamp Prize.""For the ADIAF  this edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize celebrates a quarter of a century of collective commitment to promoting the French scene  not as a school or a style  but as a true laboratory of experimentation. As the Centre Pompidou begins its transformation and the Musée d'Art Moderne of Paris reaffirms its support for the artists of our time  this 2025 edition embodies a transition full of vitality  welcomed by a large and enthusiastic audience.A powerful symbol for French art – and a substantial boost for the future of its winner.You can visit:The exhibition of the four artists nominated for the 2025 Marcel Duchamp Prize  with no appointment and no charge.

These measures are gradually being ramped up and will deliver their full effect in the 2026 financial year.In this context  Clariane:confirms its organic revenue growth target of around +5% and a wholeco 1 financial leverage ratio of less than 5.5xgrowth target of around and a ratio of less than expects EBITDA  pre-IFRS 16 and pro forma for disposals  to grow around +10% in the second half of 2025 (vs. 2024)  compared to the decline of -4.1% recorded in the first half. Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA margin in the second half should settle at around 12% with the gradual ramp-up of adjustment and cost-saving measures in France and Germany. In view of these various factors  EBITDA  pre-IFRS 16 and pro forma for disposals  for the full year is expected to increase  although at a level below the initial range of +6% to +9%.Outlook for 2023-2026:In 2026  the favourable operational improvement trajectory expected in the second half of 2025 should continue. The Group targets an improvement of its pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA margin  pro forma of disposal and excluding real-estate development  by 100 to 150 basis points compared to 2023.The Group confirms its objective of reducing its Wholeco financial leverage to below 5x as of 31 December 2026.Meeting and conference call:In connection with the publication of its revenue figures for the period ended 30 September 2025  Clariane will hold an online information meeting in English on 28 October 2025 at 3:00 p.m. (CET).Connection:Via live webcast by following the link hereBy live telephone by clicking on the following link: hereA replay of this event will be available by following the link hereThe presentation supporting this event will be available on Clariane's website www.clariane.com from 12:00 p.m. (CET).Provisional calendar of financial publications in 202626 February 2026: 2025 annual results after the close of trading on Euronext Paris23 April 2026: First quarter 2026 revenue after the close of trading on Euronext Paris12 May 2026: 2026 Annual General Meeting29 July 2026: Revenue and results for the first half of 2026 after the close of trading on Euronext Paris28 October 2026: Revenue for the third quarter of 2026 after the close of trading on Euronext Paris1 As defined in the amendment and extension to the syndicated facility agreement announced on February 17  2025.Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.14,0.38,True,English,"['nine months', 'Revenue', 'Third-quarter organic revenue growth', 'organic revenue growth target', 'Organic growth Group revenue', '€1 billion disposal programme', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'solid underlying quality', 'Net financial debt', 'first nine months', 'entire first quarter', '1 August 2025 2025 financial targets', 'financial leverage ratio', 'Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA margin', 'Community Care activities', 'future market conditions', 'organic basis', 'future growth', 'financial position', 'third quarter', 'first half', 'operating margin', 'new market', 'favourable conditions', 'regulatory conditions', 'Long-term Care', 'outpatient care', 'Specialty Care', 'Press release', 'occupancy rate', 'nursing homes', 'same period', 'case mix', 'Significant strengthening', 'bond issue', '5.5x EBITDA', 'pro forma', 'second half', 'gradual ramp-up', 'cost-saving measures', 'initial range', 'United Kingdom', 'final signing', '1Wholeco leverage', 'following formula', 'Sophie Boissard', 'strong commitment', 'steady increases', 'continued improvement', 'operational organisation', 'post-divestiture scope', 'medical, post-acute', 'United States', 'specific regulations', 'applicable restrictions', 'forward-looking statements', 'Actual events', 'rehabilitation activities', 'The Group', 'various factors', ""Petits-fils' business"", ""Petits-fils' activity"", 'strong momentum', 'actual results', 'full year', 'Important information', 'Clariane Group', 'date', '30 September', 'regions', 'improvements', 'pricing', 'completion', 'refinancing', 'Confirmation', 'less', 'disposals', 'decline', 'adjustment', 'France', 'Germany', 'view', 'level', 'millions', 'euros', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'sale', '9 April', 'performance', '30 July', 'connection', 'amendment', 'extension', 'syndicated', 'loan', '17 February', 'IAS', 'networks', 'teams', 'volumes', 'plan', 'accordance', 'commitments', 'mission', 'actions', 'central', 'fruit', 'acceleration', 'roadmap', 'offer', 'invitation', 'bonds', 'country', 'part', 'distribution', 'countries', 'people', 'possession', 'document', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'reference', 'profitability', 'Company', 'expectations', 'number']",2025-10-27,2025-10-28,globenewswire.com

The agreement  concluded during the Duqm Economic Forum 2025  reflects OQ’s continued commitment to expanding its investments in Duqm and supports national efforts to attract foreign investment and strengthen global partnerships in one of the region’s fastest-growing industrial and logistics hubs.The agreement was signed by Ashraf Hamed Al Mamari  Group Chief Executive Officer of OQ and Chris Robblee  President of Asia and Middle East  Vopak.Under the new partnership  OTTCO will hold a 51% share and Vopak 49%  with the new company set to develop and operate world-class energy storage and terminal infrastructure at Duqm. These facilities will support both traditional energy flows and the evolving demands of the global energy transition towards more integrated and sustainable ecosystems.By combining OTTCO’s strategic role as a cornerstone in crude storage and transport and Vopak’s global expertise in terminal operations  the partnership will establish a new entity that drives sustainable industrial growth and leverages Duqm’s strategic location along key international shipping routes.OTTCO currently operates the Ras Markaz crude oil storage terminal  with a total capacity of 26.7 million barrels  including 5.2 million barrels dedicated to the Duqm Refinery. The company also manages the Duqm Port storage and export terminal.

Our companies’ combined strengths in infrastructure development and operational excellence will be instrumental in creating a leading energy hub serving diverse industrial customers while supporting their sustainable growth.”The initiative aligns with Oman’s national strategy to diversify its economy and position Duqm as a competitive global economic centre and a key driver of sustainable development  supported by a long-term vision focused on enabling the flow of both hydrocarbons and emerging energy fuels such as hydrogen and renewables-based products  unlocking new pathways for Oman’s sustainable industrial growth and reinforcing Duqm’s role as a strategic enabler of global energy transition.With over USD 10 billion total investments and partnerships in Duqm  including Duqm Refinery - a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum International (KPI) as well as Marafiq’s partnership with Thailand’s Gulf Energy Development Company  OQ continues to play a central role in driving industrial growth and positioning Duqm as a cornerstone of Oman’s energy and investment future.About Royal VopakRoyal Vopak helps the world flow forward.

Our goal of strategic diversification should materialize soon with the upcoming completion of the acquisition of HSBC Assurances Vie (France)2.Let us recall that the Group strengthened its financial position in May 2025 with the successful completion of its inaugural subordinated debt issue of €500 million  intended to finance part of the acquisition of HSBC Assurances Vie (France).The 16.7% growth in activity in the first half of 2025 demonstrates our momentum and reinforces our confidence in achieving the profitability targets set out in our strategic plan.Matmut Group is built on strong mutualist foundations to which we remain deeply committed  and the Group’s solidity is one of the key pledges we make to our 4.6 million members. Meeting our commercial and financial targets contributes directly to fulfilling that commitment. I would like to thank all employees and partners for their dedication and support  as well as members and policyholders for their continued trust.”First-Half 2025 ActivityRouen  27 October 2025 - Matmut Group reported a 16.7% increase in activity in the first half of 2025 compared with the first half of 2024  reaching €1 823 million in earned premiums. All business lines contributed positively to that growth.Earned Premiums €m June-24 June-25 Change Jun-25/Jun-24 P&C 1 095 1 148 4.8% o/w Motor 697 730 4.8% o/w Home 275 295 7.2% o/w Other 123 122 -0.5% Health 406 450 10.8% Savings & Protection 61 225 266.9% Total Earned Premiums & Savings inflows 1 562 1 823 16.7% Contracts Thousands June-24 June-25 Change Jun-25/Jun-24 P&C 7 033 7 058 0.4% o/w Motor 2 854 2 849 -0.2% o/w Home 2 318 2 322 0.1% o/w Other 1 860 1 887 1.5% Health 947 982 3.7% Savings & Protection 296 345 16.5% Total contracts 8 276 8 385 1.3%Property & Casualty InsuranceHistorical business of the Group  P & C insurance recorded a 4.8% increase in earned premiums to €1 148 million and a 0.4% rise in the policy portfolio.Within P&C  the 4.8% growth in Motor insurance premiums mainly reflects a pricing effect linked to inflation in repair and spare-part costs. The near-stability in the number of policies illustrates the ongoing enhancement of the portfolio quality.Home insurance achieved the strongest performance in the P&C segment  with 7.2% growth in earned premiums and stable policy volumes  benefiting both from pricing effects and improved risk assessment for building and climate exposure. As of end-June 2025  climate-related claims frequency was twice that of first-half 2024  which had been historically low. The climate-loss budget set for the year appears consistent with the claims recorded in the first part of the year.Other P&C lines  mainly comprising professional multi-risk insurance policies and personal accident policies  posted a very slight decline in earned premiums (-0.5%) despite a 1.5% increase in policy count.Health InsuranceHealth insurance rose 10.8% in earned premiums and 3.7% in contracts. This growth was primarily driven by the strong performance of Mutuelle Ociane Matmut  whose “Santé vous bien !” individual offer continues to meet with robust commercial success.It should be noted that the contracts with MNSPF (Mutuelle Nationale des Sapeurs-Pompiers de France) taken over by Mutuelle Ociane Matmut will be recorded starting July 2025  adding approximately 27 000 beneficiaries.Savings and ProtectionThis segment includes life insurance and protection products offered to both professionals and individuals (including borrower insurance and funeral policies).The sharp increase in activity during the semester was driven by higher life-insurance inflows  supported by several initiatives  including the commercial relaunch of the Matmut Vie Épargne contract within the branch network and via the wealth-management advisory team.In the second half of 2025  life insurance is expected to grow at a slower pace due to a high comparison base.In the first half of the year  Mutlog’s protection business  which includes borrower insurance  recorded double-digit growth in the number of policies in force  with an almost equivalent increase in earned premiums.OutlookThe Group does not provide annual net income or profitability guidance. The strong commercial performance recorded in the first half  combined with strict control of administrative expenses  enables the Group to confirm the objectives of its strategic plan “Objectif: Impact ! 2024-2026”:Solvency II ratio 2026: between 180% and 220% (201% in 2024)Net combined ratio Non-Life 2026: below 100% (98.3% in 2024)Return on equity 2026: between 3% and 4% (4.5% in 2024)As announced  the acquisition of 100% of HSBC Assurances Vie (France) is expected to be completed shortly  with consolidation planned for the final two months of fiscal 2025.

Looking ahead  we expect these positive trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2025  and we remain fully on track to deliver on our financial guidance for the year”  commented Jérôme Cerisier  CEO of Exosens.Following the divestment of the group's Microwave Amplification business  revenue and adjusted gross margin figures for the 9M 2024 and 9M 2025 periods have been restated in accordance with IFRS 5. Restated historical figures (unaudited) are provided in the appendices of this press release.Revenue up +23.2% in 9M 2025 driven by continued strength in defense end marketsIn € millions 9M 2024 9M 2025 Change (€m) Change (%) LFL (%) Amplification 192.2 231.8 +39.6 +20.6% +20.0% Detection & Imaging 76.8 97.0 +20.1 +26.2% (0.2)% Eliminations & Other (2.9) (0.9) +1.9 nm nm Total revenue 266.2 327.8 +61.6 +23.2% +15.1%Exosens delivered sustained revenue performance in 9M 2025  maintaining its strong growth trajectory. Consolidated revenue amounted to €327.8 million  recording a growth of +23.2% (+€61.6 million) compared to 9M 2024. On a like-for-like basis  revenue increased by +15.1% year-over-year  driven by the continued strength of defense end markets.Amplification revenue amounted to €231.8 million in 9M 2025  achieving a significant growth of +20.6% (+€39.6 million) compared to 9M 2024. This reflected higher sales volumes  driven by increased production capacity and strong demand for image intensifier tubes for defense night vision applications  a favorable product mix and improved yields.As defense priorities evolve amid geopolitical tensions  the growing emphasis on night vision operational superiority is driving strong demand for night vision goggles. In this dynamic market  Exosens leverages its position as the strategic supplier of high-performance  ITAR-free image intensifier tubes to NATO members and tier-1 allies. End users have continued to increase their procurement of night vision systems  as evidenced by several major business wins  particularly in Europe. The Group estimates that night vision goggle equipment rates will remain well below end users' targeted levels through the end of the 2027 mid-term horizon. Europe is expected to remain a strong growth market for the foreseeable future  further strengthened by large programs currently underway or planned in the US and APAC regions.In this favorable context  Exosens announced earlier this year a €20 million investment plan to grow production capacity in both Europe and the US  aiming for a +25% increase by 2027. As global demand continues to strengthen and in light of NATO members’ planned defense budget increases toward the 3.5% of GDP target  Exosens has decided to further expand capacity by +15% with an additional €17 million investment in Europe. In total  this decision brings the 2025 announced investments to €37 million  which are expected to deliver a combined +40% increase in the group's global capacity by 2027  covering the 18mm  16mm and 5G product families. This plan is designed to further strengthen Exosens’ global footprint  enabling it to meet the growing needs for night vision systems among defense end users and capture additional market opportunities  particularly in the US.In addition  in a rapidly evolving threat environment where technological superiority is critical  Exosens remains at the forefront of innovation with the launch of its 5G image intensifier tubes early September – a major technological breakthrough in the field of night vision. 5G sets new performance standards in image quality  observation range and luminous gain  with +30% overall performance (FOM) and up to +35% detection range vs. current standard. Exosens will be the only player able to deliver this level of technology to NATO members  cementing its role as NATO’s strategic night vision supplier. The group has received orders for over 5 000 5G tubes prior to the product's official launch  already making 5G a commercial success.On M&A  Exosens closed on 15 July 2025 the acquisition of NVLS  a Spanish-based specialist in man-portable night vision and thermal devices. This strategic move will allow the group to expand its total addressable market and to provide high-end night vision goggles to end users  leveraging advanced technological capabilities combining sensors and optics to meet the needs of the soldier of the future. On 29 September 2025  Exosens announced that it has secured a major contract with the Spanish army for the supply of 17 000 advanced night vision monoculars from NVLS  utilizing its 16mm 4G intensifier tubes  to be delivered between 2025 and 2028. This landmark contract highlights NVLS’ contribution to European sovereignty by strengthening its industrial capacity as a leading Spanish supplier of night vision equipment for dismounted soldiers.In line with its strategy to focus resources on higher-value activities which are closely aligned with its long-term priorities  the group has decided to divest its Microwave Amplification business. The signing of the asset purchase agreement marks a key step in this process  with the transaction expected to close latest in early 2026. In 2024  the group's Microwave Amplification business generated €10.6 million in revenue and a €1.3 million adjusted EBITDA loss  and consumed €5 million in cash. While the divestment will not generate cash inflows  the group expects to recognize a non-cash accounting loss in 2025  reflecting the impairment of goodwill and associated assets. Overall  the transaction will have a positive impact on the Group’s profitability and cash profile once completed.Detection & Imaging revenue amounted to €97.0 million in 9M 2025  representing a solid growth of +26.2% (+€20.1 million) compared to 9M 2024  driven by the scope effect from acquisitions completed by the group in 2024 (Centronic and LR Tech) and 2025 (Noxant). On a like-for-like basis  D&I revenue remained broadly stable year-over-year (-0.2%). After a first quarter affected by temporary headwinds (-13.0%)  mainly related to US scientific research  D&I returned to robust like-for-like growth in the second (+7.1%) and third (+4.3%) quarters  with continuing traction across key high-growth markets such as defense and nuclear.Momentum in the defense sector has remained particularly strong  with the group seeing growing demand for imaging and protection systems  driven by the increasing adoption of optronic technologies for platform-based applications and the emergence of drone and counter-drone devices as a central pillar of modern warfare. These areas represent a highly promising growth avenue  reinforcing Exosens' position in next-generation defense capabilities  particularly in support of European sovereignty.In nuclear  SMR-specific technologies have continued to gain strong market traction  driving the development of new products for longer-term business growth. In life sciences  ongoing uncertainties in US scientific research have weighed on overall demand for imaging systems  while the industrial control market has shown early signs of recovery  supported by a restart of capex investment and the rising adoption of artificial intelligence.D&I like-for-like growth is expected to accelerate further throughout the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year  driven by solid underlying end-market trends.On M&A  Exosens closed on 13 March 2025 the acquisition of Noxant  a specialist in high-performance cooled infrared cameras  notably for drone-based defense and surveillance applications. In addition  the group closed on 20 October 2025 the acquisition of Phasics  a leader in wavefront sensing technology  further expanding its offering in high performance imaging solutions for defense  industrial control and life sciences.Strong improvement in adjusted gross margin  up +28.7% in 9M 20259M 2024 9M 2025 Change In €m % of sales In €m % of sales In €m In % Amplification 91.5 47.6% 121.8 52.5% +30.3 +33.1% Detection & Imaging 38.9 50.7% 46.1 47.6% +7.2 +18.5% Eliminations & Other 0.1 nm 0.1 nm -0.0 nm Adjusted gross margin 130.5 49.0% 168.0 51.2% +37.5 +28.7%Exosens recorded a strong increase in adjusted gross margin at group level  supported by higher sales volumes  improved yields and a favorable product mix. The group's adjusted gross margin stood at €168.0 million in 9M 2025  reflecting a significant growth of +28.7% (+€37.5 million) compared to 9M 2024. As a percentage of consolidated revenue  adjusted gross margin was 51.2% in 9M 2025  marking an improvement of +221bps year-over-year.Adjusted gross margin for the Amplification segment reached €121.8 million in 9M 2025  representing a sustained growth of +33.1% (+€30.3 million) compared to 9M 2024. Margin rate increased by +494bps to 52.5% in 9M 2025  driven by higher sales volumes  favorable product mix and improved yields.Adjusted gross margin for the Detection & Imaging segment amounted to €46.1 million in 9M 2025  posting an increase of +18.5% (+€7.2 million) compared to 9M 2024. Margin rate stood at 47.6% in 9M 2025  representing a decrease of -308bps from the high comparable base of the previous year (50.7% in 9M 2024). This year-over-year margin contraction mainly reflected the integration of acquisitions completed in H2 2024 and in H1 2025  due to their smaller scale and the lack of economies of scale at this stage  and a change in product mix  as a result of lower sales of detectors for life sciences applications compared to 9M 2024.Outlook for 2025 and the 2024-2026 period confirmedExosens expects a continued strong performance in 2025  with revenue growth in the high-teens and adjusted EBITDA growth in the low twenties compared to 20244.The Group expects high-teens 2024-2026 adjusted EBITDA CAGR and a cash conversion5 ratio in the range of 70%-75% over the period  taking into account capacity investment in Europe and in the US.Furthermore  the Group intends to pursue its selective external growth strategy  at a pace consistent with historical trend  while maintaining a leverage ratio6 of around 2x.***Financial Calendar23/02/2026 : FY 2025 results.: FY 2025 results. 27/04/2026 : Q1 2026 revenue & adj. gross margin.: Q1 2026 revenue & adj. gross margin. 28/07/2026 : H1 2026 results.About ExosensExosens is a high‐tech company  with more than 85 years of experience in the innovation  development  manufacturing and sale of high‐end electro‐optical technologies in the field of amplification  detection and imaging.

Between vulnerability  and metamorphosis  science and poetry  this edition highlighted an art in dialogue with its era.After Frieze London  Art Basel Paris opens its doors at the Grand Palais  while the auction houses unveil their autumn masterpieces.Xie Lei – Copyright Margot Montigny Artprice's 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report cover  featuring the digital work “The Thinking Fiend” by Other WorldMeanwhile  the art world has been celebrating another major event: the award of the Marcel Duchamp Prize  initiated by the ADIAF (Association for the International Diffusion of French Art) and supported by Artprice by Artmarket.The Marcel Duchamp Prize was initiated 25 years ago by a group of French collectors and the ADIAF. It received significant impetus from French collector Gilles Fuchs  who noted a decline in the international reputation of French artists in the 1990s. His motivation was to contribute to a better representation and promotion of French art in a delicate context for the French contemporary art market.This year  the prestigious Prize was awarded to painter Xie Lei  whose paintings occupy a disconcerting space between dreams and reality  inviting us to slow the pace of our visual consumption and rediscover the emotional power of images.Thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  praised ""the creativity  symbolic power and diversity"" of this edition  congratulating the winner Xie Lei as well as finalists Bianca Bondi  Eva Nielsen and Lionel Sabatté  all examples of the wealth of the current French art scene:""Artprice by Artmarket is very proud to support the Association for the International Diffusion of French Art (ADIAF) and the Marcel Duchamp Prize. In a context where Paris is establishing itself as the most dynamic marketplace in the world in terms of the number of contemporary works sold at auction  the Marcel Duchamp Prize fully contributes to the promotion of the French art scene and its influence. This ambition is shared by the Minister of Culture  Madame Rachida Dati  in her new plan to strengthen the French contemporary art scene.""Claude Bonnin  President of ADIAF :""For 25 years  each edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize has been a tribute to the vitality and creativity of the contemporary French art scene. On behalf of the 300 collectors of the ADIAF  I would like to warmly congratulate the winner  Xie Lei. I am delighted with the quality of the Marcel Duchamp Prize exhibition  presented for the first time this year at the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris. This edition exemplifies the superb collective formed by the State  the City of Paris  and the ADIAF around a common objective: to promote the French scene by giving essential visibility to its artists  in France and internationally. I would also like to emphasize that  in addition to this exhibition  the four finalists will benefit from our association's support program  including residencies at the Manufacture de Sèvres and the Villa Albertine as well as exhibitions abroad.""A prize has become a global benchmarkIn a quarter of a century  the Marcel Duchamp Prize has established itself as a major marker of contemporary creation  comparable to the prestigious British Turner Prize and the American Hugo Boss Prize. Supported by the French Ministry of Culture and a number of major public institutions  each year it highlights French or French-domiciled artists whose works embody the vitality  diversity  and quality of the current scene.The winner receives an endowment of €35 000 and support from a museum with a view to enhancing their international visibility  in conjunction with a network of partners such as the French Institute  the Manufacture de Sèvres  national Museums  and the Villa Albertine in the United States.Beyond the financial reward  the ""Prix Marcel Duchamp"" is therefore a substantial recognition accelerator that has already benefited artists like Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster  Kader Attia  Tatiana Trouvé  Tarik Kiswanson and Melik Ohanian  whose recognitions all extended well beyond French borders after being nominated as winners of the prize.As Claude Bonnin  President of ADIAF: ""The Marcel Duchamp Prize is not intended to reward emerging artists  but to support those with international potential.""This greater visibility naturally translates into the art market  with the winners gaining easier access to museum collections and their galleries benefiting from a stronger sales dynamic. Above all  the Prize confers lasting critical legitimacy  placing their works in the long term  somewhat above the fluctuations of fashion and short-term trends.The 2025 finalistsThe 2025 edition of the Marcel Duchamp Prize once again attests to the vitality and diversity of the French scene  bringing together four artists with unique paths and worlds  exploring themes of materiality  memory  and metamorphosis.For Bianca Bondi (born in 1986 in Johannesburg  represented by the gallery Mor Charpentier  Paris)  transformation is a process as poetic as it is spiritual. Her installation Silent House evokes a dwelling suspended between dream and memory: patinated furniture  plants and salt basins are covered in crystals  revealing the living memory of matter and the beauty of the passage of time.- Discover Bianca Bondi on ArtpriceEva Nielsen (born in 1983 in Les Lilas near Paris  represented by the galleries Peter Kilchmann and The Pill) explores the porosity of images and surfaces. A painter-photographer  she layers latex  leather  silk  and screen printing to create fragmented landscapes where the memory of places dissolves into the pictorial texture. Her works invite a stratified interpretation of reality  between figuration and abstraction.- Discover Eva Nielsen on ArtpriceFor Lionel Sabatté (born in 1975 in Toulouse  represented by the Ceysson & Bénétière gallery)  matter becomes memory. True to his practice of collecting – dust  ash  dead skin  tree fragments – this time  the artist has gleaned the residues of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris  to create a new series of dust drawings. Between fragility and mystery  he makes the invisible a tangible presence.- Discover Lionel Sabatté on ArtpriceFinally  Xie Lei (born in 1983 in China  represented in Paris by the Semiose gallery) deploys an introspective style of painting  nourished by literary and cinematographic references. His canvases  bathed in ambiguity  suspend the gaze between dream and reality. Against the current of contemporary celerity  he offers a deceleration of time  a meditation on the persistence of images and the depth of the visible.- Discover Xie Lei on ArtpriceFrom among these diverse approaches – between materiality  memory  and perception – the jury chose to distinguish Xie Lei for the singular strength of his work and the relevance of his reflection on contemporary societal issues.A changing French sceneThe 2025 selection of artists highlights how the French scene is becoming increasingly international while asserting its own identity: a focus on technique  materials  memory and the environment. These artists do not claim to be part of a ""French style"" but rather have adopted a posture of openness  where the boundaries between disciplines and origins are blurred.The ADIAF  true to its original spirit  continues to play a leading role in this dynamic. By organizing more than sixty workshop visits each year across France and abroad  it maintains a dynamic link with creations in progress. This fieldwork feeds into a highly demanding selection process  supported by more than 300 committed art collectors.A 2025 edition marked by a change of venueThis 25th edition has a special significance: for the first time  the exhibition of the nominated artists was held not at the Centre Pompidou  which is currently undergoing renovation for four years  but at the Musée d'Art Moderne of Paris (MAM). This change of setting  far from being anecdotal  was an opportunity to rethink the presentation of the Prize and the exhibition of artists' works. Its curators  Julia Garimorth and Jean-Pierre Criqui  have made every effort to offer a coherent journey through the diversity of the proposals.Fabrice Hergott  Director of the Musée d'Art Moderne of Paris:""Xie Lei's paintings are a particularly accomplished expression for the beginning of the 21st century. Since the September 11  2001 attacks  there has been a general feeling of doubt and vertigo. Lei's work offers a representation that is both concise and captivating  making him one of the most remarkable figures of the new French scene.
