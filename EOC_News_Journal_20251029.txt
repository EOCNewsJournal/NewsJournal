You can ban Russian energy companies and prohibit doing business with them in Europe  but they have already mostly repositioned themselves in other markets.Due to the loss of inexpensive Russian raw materials  the price of European goods has increased  and their competitiveness will likely continue to decline.The mounting economic challenges facing the European Union are a clear indication of this trend.The impact of the current European sanctions on Russian banks and financial institutions is minimal as well. Any painful measures Brussels could have taken have already been taken. The key issue here is the frozen Russian financial assets in Euroclear that Europeans are trying to exploit.For Brussels  there's a sort of charm of frozen assets.Backed by France  Germany  and several other EU countries  the European Commission's latest scheme aims to provide Kyiv with €140 billion in frozen Russian assets.However  this plan carries unprecedented risks. Essentially  it is a poorly disguised form of expropriation.Proponents of the plan argue that it is a loan to Ukraine  secured by the assets' value. Technically  the EU does not dispute Moscow's ownership.Nevertheless  investors remain unconvinced. The world of big money is built on predictability and a set of widely accepted rules based on the protection of property rights.Confiscating Russian assets would damage the reputation of European financial institutions. Amid growing macroeconomic pressure on key countries  the EU will scare away those who wish to keep their money in Europe. This will primarily affect countries in Asia and the Middle East.While these problems may have remained Europe's alone  the EU's actions could still directly harm America.The devil is in the specifics.The total amount of frozen Euroclear Russian assets is 258 billion euros. Of that  55 billion euros are assets of the Moscow National Settlement Depository  which was sanctioned in 2022. Another 10 billion euros are held by Russian banks whose depositors are not primarily on sanctions lists.The largest portion   around 193 billion euros  consists of immobilized transactions belonging to the Russian central bank.Many of these are transfers to Western counterparties  including American ones. For example  there is a 2.25 billion euro deposit that is set to be returned to JPMorgan Chase.Unsurprisingly  Moscow's counterparts in most cases prefer to keep a low profile and are not eager to loudly defend their rights.Another issue is the legality of such actions.In September 2023  the European Union court ruled that individuals not on sanctions lists are entitled to the return of their assets.However  the Belgian Treasury still refuses to comply with this decision  citing the need to ensure the EU's financial security.This creates a legal conflict and the basis for numerous lawsuits against the Belgian government. The Belgian Council of State is already considering over 200 similar claims. Naturally  the authorities are doing everything they can to slow down the review and execution process. Nevertheless  the investors who were robbed are unlikely to abandon their property claims.If the European Commission implements its proposed plan to seize some of Russia's frozen assets  Europe will face systemic consequences. Investors will question the security of their portfolios  and the euro  which has accounted for around 20 percent of global reserves in recent years  will lose its global influence.Rising political risks will make European assets less attractive  raising borrowing costs and hindering long-term investment opportunities. The success of the Capital Markets Union  which is critical to Europe's future  will be called into question.However  these unprecedented actions by Europe will directly damage the U.S. dollar.Given all this  it's clear that the use of the dollar in international transactions will continue to decline. Gold will definitely become more important  as will other currencies. Central banks will seek more neutral jurisdictions in which to place reserves. An increasing number of foreign companies are demanding that their U.S. counterparts settle contracts in currencies other than the dollarAdditionally  the reputation of Western financial institutions will suffer  which will negatively impact the global economy.If losing face is something Europeans are used to   then the unnecessary risks that Brussels and its partners are pushing Washington to take should be avoided.In particular  it is fully understood by Beijing that similar actions may be taken against China in the future. This is particularly crucial in the context of the ongoing intensification of the trade and economic tensions between China and the United States.Xi Jinping has already demonstrated his willingness to escalate the situation by imposing strict restrictions on the supply of rare earth metals and magnets. Further escalating the trade war and beginning a tough financial confrontation with China hardly serves American interests.American interests have to come first.Similar assessments of the consequences of confiscating Russian assets were made in 2023 by Robert J. Shiller  the 2013 Nobel Prize laureate in economics and a professor at Yale University.Schiller made it clear that transferring frozen Russian assets to Ukraine would weaken the dollar's position as the world's reserve currency and accelerate the de-dollarization of the global economy.Even at the height of the Cold War  the West did not seriously consider plans to confiscate USSR assets due to the risks of losing control.However  Europe's bold plan signals that the international financial system is entering a new era in which political expediency trumps legal principles.The U.S. must ensure that Europe's financial recklessness does not harm America's financial health.,negative,0.01,0.29,0.7,negative,0.0,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['Financial Suicide', 'Europe', 'inexpensive Russian raw materials', 'Moscow National Settlement Depository', 'several other EU countries', 'last remaining ties', 'mounting economic challenges', 'growing macroeconomic pressure', 'long-term investment opportunities', 'The Belgian Council', 'Rising political risks', 'Capital Markets Union', 'Russian central bank', 'European Union court', 'U.S. counterparts', 'Russian energy companies', 'U.S. dollar', 'Western financial institutions', 'European financial institutions', '2.25 billion euro deposit', 'current European sanctions', 'Russian financial assets', 'Euroclear Russian assets', 'other markets', 'Russian economy', 'Russian oil', 'Russian banks', 'Western counterparties', 'Central banks', 'European cooperation', 'gas companies', 'European goods', 'European Commission', 'unprecedented risks', 'key countries', 'Belgian Treasury', 'Belgian government', 'European assets', 'foreign companies', 'unnecessary risks', '258 billion euros', '55 billion euros', '10 billion euros', '193 billion euros', 'other currencies', 'devastating package', 'long term', 'latest package', 'specific banks', 'clear indication', 'painful measures', 'latest scheme', 'disguised form', ""assets' value"", 'Middle East', 'total amount', 'largest portion', 'immobilized transactions', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'most cases', 'low profile', 'financial security', 'legal conflict', 'numerous lawsuits', '200 similar claims', 'execution process', 'property claims', 'systemic consequences', 'recent years', 'global influence', 'borrowing costs', 'international transactions', 'neutral jurisdictions', 'increasing number', 'global economy', 'sanctions lists', 'frozen assets', 'key issue', 'big money', 'property rights', 'global reserves', 'unprecedented actions', 'similar actions', 'works', 'bureaucrats', 'Brussels', 'principle', 'approach', 'business', 'loss', 'price', 'competitiveness', 'trend', 'impact', 'Europeans', 'sort', 'charm', 'France', 'Germany', 'Kyiv', 'plan', 'expropriation', 'Proponents', 'loan', 'Ukraine', 'ownership', 'investors', 'world', 'predictability', 'rules', 'protection', 'reputation', 'Asia', 'problems', 'America', 'devil', 'specifics', 'depositors', 'transfers', 'example', 'legality', 'September', 'individuals', 'return', 'decision', 'need', 'basis', 'State', 'authorities', 'review', 'portfolios', '20 percent', 'success', 'future', 'question', 'use', 'Gold', 'contracts', 'face', 'something', 'partners', 'Washington', 'Beijing']",2025-10-28,2025-10-29,americanthinker.com

Institutional Focus: Partnership reinforces Streamex’s focus as an investment-grade  regulated RWA tokenization platform delivering institutional infrastructure and gold-backed yield-bearing assets.LOS ANGELES  Oct. 27  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Streamex Corp. (“Streamex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: STEX)  an institutional commodity tokenization company  today announced a strategic partnership with Chainlink  an industry-leading oracle and technology provider  to serve as its official oracle & On-Chain Transparency provider.Streamex has entered a strategic partnership with Chainlink as its official oracle & on-chain transparency provider. As part of the partnership  Streamex is integrating the Chainlink interoperability standard via CCIP across the Base and Solana mainnets. We’re leveraging the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard to facilitate cross-chain token transfers of the institutional-grade  gold-backed stablecoin GLDY. In addition  Streamex is integrating the Chainlink data standard through Proof of Reserve to provide real-time  onchain verification of the gold reserves backing GLDY  and Price Feeds to deliver tamper-proof market data that powers secure and reliable onchain gold markets.Streamex offers a platform focused on the tokenization of real-world commodities  beginning with its flagship GLDY token  a regulated  yield-bearing digital asset fully backed by physical gold. By integrating Chainlink Proof of Reserve and going cross-chain  Streamex makes GLDY seamlessly transferable across major blockchain ecosystems  improves liquidity and accessibility for institutions and users  provides additional verification for audited gold reserve backing  and simplifies asset management by unifying token issuance  trading  and collateral verification within a secure  cross-chain environment.Streamex selected CCIP as our interoperability solution because CCTs enable self-serve deployments  full control and ownership for developers  enhanced programmability  and zero-slippage transfers. Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance. Connecting Streamex to the Chainlink community and ecosystem offers a multitude of growth opportunities that help Streamex get closer to its goals and increase ecosystem adoption.In order to enable secure cross-chain transfers of GLDY  we needed access to a highly secure and reliable interoperability solution. After reviewing various solutions  we integrated Chainlink CCIP because it provides a multitude of important benefits and features  such as:Defense-in-depth security —CCIP’s consensus layer is powered by the same Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) infrastructure that secures nearly $100+ billion in DeFi TVL and enabled tens of trillions in on-chain transaction value since the start of 2022.—CCIP’s consensus layer is powered by the same Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) infrastructure that secures nearly $100+ billion in DeFi TVL and enabled tens of trillions in on-chain transaction value since the start of 2022. Secure Token Transfers —CCTs are token logic agnostic  meaning token developers can deploy pre-audited token pool contracts to turn any ERC20-compatible token into a CCT or deploy their own custom token pool contracts for bespoke token use cases. CCTs do not require token developers to inherit any CCIP-specific code within their token’s smart contract. CCTs also benefit from additional security functions in their CCIP token pools such as configurable rate limits and reliability features such as Smart Execution  which helps ensure reliable transaction execution on the destination chain regardless of blockchain network congestion.—CCTs are token logic agnostic  meaning token developers can deploy pre-audited token pool contracts to turn any ERC20-compatible token into a CCT or deploy their own custom token pool contracts for bespoke token use cases.

Subject to certain customary closing conditions  NVIDIA will subscribe for the shares at a subscription price of USD 6.01 per share. The transaction will see NVIDIA become a 2.90% shareholder of Nokia.The strategic partnership and investment are expected to create significant value for both companies. Nokia will use the proceeds from the issuance to accelerate its strategic plans to advance trusted connectivity for the AI supercycle and other general corporate purposes. Nokia intends to accelerate development of Nokia’s 5G & 6G RAN software to run on NVIDIA’s architecture and will make investments to drive Nokia’s strategic goal of increasing its presence in the AI & Cloud market with data center aligned networking solutions within its Network Infrastructure business. Nokia and NVIDIA have agreed to collaborate on AI networking solutions and explore opportunities to incorporate Nokia’s data center switching and optical technologies in NVIDIA’s future AI infrastructure architecture.Nokia will host a press and investor conference call on 28 October 2025 at 3:30pm EST (7:30pm GMT  9:30pm EET) to discuss both the strategic partnership and the purpose of the investment.Details of the equity investmentSubject to certain customary closing conditions  NVIDIA will subscribe for the new shares at a price of USD 6.01 (EUR 5.16) per share  equating to an effective capital contribution to Nokia of approximately USD 1.0 billion (EUR 0.86 billion). All amounts denominated in USD have been converted into EUR using the USD/EUR exchange reference rate published by the European Central Bank for 27 October 2025  which was 0.8591 (USD 1 being EUR 0.8591). The subscription price shall be recorded in Nokia's reserve for invested unrestricted equity. The directed share issuance is an essential part of the strategic partnership with NVIDIA.The subscription price has been determined as part of the negotiations between Nokia and NVIDIA. In addition to its own assessment of the strategic partnership  Nokia has taken independent legal and financial advice to assist in its evaluation of the fairness to Nokia of the terms of the share issuance  taking into account the strategic partnership. In the assessment of Nokia  the strategic partnership  including the share issuance  benefits Nokia and its shareholders  and therefore there is a weighty financial reason for deviating from the pre-emptive rights of the shareholders of Nokia in the share issuance.The Nokia shares will be delivered to NVIDIA in the form of American Depositary Shares.Nokia expects that the new shares will be registered with the Finnish Trade Register in November and be entered in the book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Finland promptly thereafter. The total number of Nokia shares following the share issuance and registration of the new shares is expected to be 5 742 239 696. The new shares represent approximately 2.98% of the total number of Nokia shares prior to the share issuance and approximately 2.90% of the total number of Nokia shares following the share issuance. After their registration with the Finnish Trade Register  the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki and Euronext Paris together with other Nokia shares  and on the New York Stock Exchange  in the form of American Depositary Shares.The resolution to issue shares is based on the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2025.AdvisorsJ.P.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM)...,Almere  The NetherlandsOct 28  2025  6 p.m. CETStrong Q3 earnings amid mixed market conditionsASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its Q3 2025 results (unaudited).Financial highlights€ million Q3 2024 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 New orders 815.3 702.5 636.8 yoy change % at constant currencies 30% (4%) (17%) Revenue 778.6 835.6 800.0 yoy change % as reported 25% 18% 3% yoy change % at constant currencies 26% 23% 8% Gross profit 384.4 433.2 414.9 Gross profit margin % 49.4% 51.8% 51.9% Operating result 215.2 258.4 242.8 Operating result margin % 27.6% 30.9% 30.3% Adjusted operating result 1 219.9 263.2 247.5 Adjusted operating result margin %1 28.2% 31.5% 30.9% Net earnings 127.9 202.4 384.1 Adjusted net earnings 1 133.6 173.0 206.21 Adjusted figures are non-IFRS performance measures. Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €637 million in Q3 2025 decreased by 17% over the same period last year at constant currency (decreased by 22% as reported). Compared to Q2 2025  orders decreased by 7% at constant currency (decreased by 9% as reported). The sequential decrease in order is predominantly attributable to orders from the Chinese market  which were strong in the first half year  as highlighted in the previous quarter. Advanced logic/foundry orders increased strongly compared to Q2  even though lower than initially expected  as indicated in our press release from September 23  2025.Revenue of €800 million increased by 8% at constant currencies (increased by 3% as reported) from Q3 last year. At constant currencies  revenue remained flat compared to Q2 2025 (decreased by 4% as reported). This was at the higher end of our guidance of Q3 revenue to be in a range of flat to down 5% versus Q2 at constant currencies.Gross profit margin of 51.9% in Q3 2025 improved compared to 49.4% in Q3 last year  minor increase compared to 51.8% in Q2 2025. Q3 2025 margin remained healthy thanks to mix  including continued strong sales to China.Adjusted operating result margin of 30.9% increased by 2.7% points compared to the same period last year and slightly decreased by 0.6% points compared to previous quarter. The y-o-y improvement this quarter is mainly due to higher gross profit margin and a decrease in SG&A.Net earnings included a non-cash result of €181 million  related to the full reversal of the previous impairment of the ASMPT stake  reflecting the recovery in the market valuation of ASMPT.Comment“ASM reported strong quarterly profitability amidst mixed market conditions ” said Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 8% year-on-year to €800 million at constant currencies. Revenue was approximately flat at constant currency compared to Q2  landing at the high end of our previous guidance range. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in our advanced logic/foundry business.Operating margin was robust at 31% following a strong gross margin and tight cost discipline on SG&A expenses  while increasing R&D investment by 10%  reinforcing our commitment to innovation and future readiness. Gross margin held strong at 51.9%  driven by positive mix effects  including sales from China which were lower than in Q2 but still at a relatively high level. Even with less favorable mix effects in Q4  we expect the gross margin for the full year 2025 to be around 51%.Bookings totaled €637 million  a 7% sequential decline at constant currencies  largely due to a substantial drop in bookings from China  including the impact from recently announced export restrictions  following a strong first half.Order intake in the advanced logic/foundry segment showed strong sequential growth  albeit with very mixed customer dynamics and below prior projections  as already communicated. Demand in the power/analog/wafer markets  including in SiC  continued to be weak. Orders for HBM-related advanced DRAM remained stable at healthy levels.We expect the subdued order trend to bottom out in Q4 at a slightly higher level than Q3. Quarterly orders are projected to pick up again as 2026 progresses. This is expected to be driven by: continued healthy advanced logic/foundry investments  including the start of 1.4nm pilot line investments in the second half of 2026; increasing investments in the DRAM segment; and a gradual recovery in (Si-based) power/analog/wafer segment. Demand in China is expected to normalize  as communicated previously  with a projected double-digit year-on-year decrease in 2026 China revenue.As shared during our Investor Day on September 23  2025  we remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory. Recent industry announcements have reinforced expectations that AI will fuel solid growth in the semiconductor markets for many years to come. This will drive above-average growth in the advanced logic/foundry and DRAM markets. These trends align closely with ASM’s core strength in ALD and Epi technologies. We are seeing evidence of this through new wins in Epi and ALD dipole and work function related layers in DRAM HBM for nodes expected to ramp in the next couple of years. In our Investor Day  we highlighted the increase of $450-500 million in our served available market with the transition to the 1.4nm gate-all-around technology  and the increase of $400-450 million in DRAM with the move to 4F² technology starting in 2028 (both based on 100k wafer starts per month capacity). We have also stepped up our focus on the advanced packaging (AP) market  leveraging our chemistry and materials expertise and deposition capabilities  with some recent wins in ALD liner for through silicon via (TSV) applications in this segment. Supported by continued leadership in ALD and growing share in leading-edge Epi  we introduced a revenue target of more than €5.7 billion by 2030  implying a CAGR of at least 12% for the next several years.”OutlookFor Q4 2025  we expect revenue to be in a range of €630 to €660 million. For the full year 2025  we continue to expect revenue growth at close to 10% at constant currencies. Despite a projected slow start in 2026  we expect ASM revenue to grow in 2026.Share buyback programDuring the third quarter  on July 25  2025  we completed the €150 million share buyback program that was started on April 30  2025. In total  we repurchased 322 533 shares at an average price of €465.07  under the 2025 program.ASM Investor Day 2025On September 23  2025  ASM held its Investor Day  where Hichem M’Saad  CEO  and Paul Verhagen  CFO  together with other senior leaders  provided updates on our business  financial performance  and market outlook  and outlined our strategic priorities through 2030. Highlights included:Guidance 2027: revenue adjusted for currency only to €3.7-€4.6 billion and margins increased.New guidance for 2030 is as follows:Revenue of more than €5.7 billion  representing a 2024-2030 CAGR of at least 12%  outperforming WFE.Gross margin target range increased to 47%-51%Operating margin target range increased to 28%-32%. Target >30% by 2030.Continue low double-digit % investment in net R&D while SG&A is expected to decrease to below 7% in 2030  both as % of total sales.Capex €150-250 million in years with infrastructure expansion and €100-200 million after main expansions are completed.Free cash flow is expected to increase to more than €1 billion by 2030.About ASMASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

As noted in its press release of 28 September 2025 (see here)  the Company indicated that it would carefully review this decision.The Company remains convinced that it complied with the rules under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and that it has always communicated accurately and truthfully. The Company is pleased that the Sanctions Committee  following a thorough investigation of the facts  indeed confirms this with regard to the Company’s communication on 30 October 2018 concerning its relationship with Trafigura and the terms of the commercial agreements  the expected EBITDA contribution from the redevelopment of Port Pirie  its solvency position  and certain aspects of its liquidity position.The Sanctions Committee did convict the Company on two points (specifically  relating to a limited number of aspects of its communication on 30 October 2018 concerning its liquidity position  as well as the late notification to the FSMA of the delay of disclosure of inside information) and imposed an administrative fine of EUR 80 000 in this respect. The Company does not agree with this. Nevertheless  after careful consideration  it has decided not to lodge an appeal before the Market Court against the Sanctions Committee’s decision. In making this decision  the Company took into account  among other things  the fact that the Sanctions Committee dismissed the majority of the allegations  as well as the amount of the imposed fine.As outlined in the press release of 26 October 2025 (see here)  certain shareholders of the Company filed a petition with the Market Court on Friday  24 October 2025  seeking to appeal the Sanctions Committee’s decision. The Company disputes the allegations made by these shareholders. It is currently reviewing and analysing the petition  and will defend its position in the proceedings.More informationFor more information  the Company refers to the overview of current proceedings available on the Company website at https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings.About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

The quarterly and nine months unaudited financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on October 28  2025.Financial Highlights for the third quarter ended September 30  2025The Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30  2025  are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).Operating IncomeThe increase in Research tax credit during the three and the nine months ended September 30  2025  is primarily due to the fact that more eligible activities have been carried out in the period  including the related costs of the FAREVA platform.In millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP nine months ended September 30  three months ended September 30  2025 2024 2025 2024 Research tax credits 5.0 3.6 2.8 1.1 Operating income 5.0 3.6 2.8 1.1Operating ExpensesOperating expenses amounted to $107.0 million for the nine months ended September 30  2025  compared with $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30  2024  an increase by $10.6 million driven mostly by the launch of the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study.In millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP nine months ended September 30  three months ended September 30  2025 2024 2025 2024 Research & Development (83.8) (70.4) (28.6) (23.7) Sales & Marketing (1.9) (2.3) (1.2) (0.5) General & Administrative (21.3) (23.7) (7.3) (7.2) Operating expenses (107.0) (96.4) (37.1) (31.4)Net Loss and Net Loss Per ShareThe Company recorded a net loss for the nine months ended September 30  2025  of $102.1 million  compared to a net loss of $90.9 million for the nine months ended September 30  2024.On a per share basis  net loss (based on the weighted average number of 124 723 638 shares outstanding over the period) was (0.82) USD/share for the nine months ended September 30  2025.U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP In millions of USD nine months ended September 30  three months ended September 30  (unaudited) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Net income / (loss) (in millions of USD) (102.1) (90.9) (33.2) (30.4) Basic / diluted net income / (loss) per share (USD/share) (0.82) (0.95) (0.24) (0.32)Cash and Cash EquivalentsOur Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $69.8 million as of September 30  2025  compared to $32.5 million as of December 31  2024  a net increase of $37.4 million.On March 27  2025  the company announced a private placement financing (""2025 PIPE"") of up to $306.9 million (€284.5 million)  to advance Viaskin® Peanut patch through Biologics License Application (”BLA”) submission and U.S. commercial launch  if approved. The 2025 PIPE included gross proceeds of $125.5 million (€116.3 million) received on April 7  2025.However  it should be noted that the Company may receive an aggregate of up to $181.4 million (€168.2 million) in gross proceeds if all warrants in connection with the 2025 PIPE are exercised  subject to satisfaction of specified conditions. The VITESSE Phase 3 study hitting its primary endpoint will trigger an acceleration of the exercise period of the warrants (topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025). DBV expects that the proceeds of this funding will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  to finance the continued development of the Viaskin Peanut program in 4-7 years old  to finance the preparation and submission of a potential BLA  and to finance the readiness of a launch of Viaskin peanut in the U.S.  if approved.In addition  in September 2025  the Company established an equity offering program (the “ATM Program”)  pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"")  from time to time through its sale agent  having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0 million (subject to French regulatory limits). Subsequent to the end of the third quarter  the Company received a total gross amount of approximately $30 million from the issuance of 11 538 460 Ordinary Shares (underlying 2 307 692 ADSs) on October 6  2025 pursuant to the ATM Program.As of the date of the filing  with the receipt of the aforementioned proceeds  and based on its current operations  plans  and assumptions examined by the Board on October 28  2025  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2026.As such  cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months  and these conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.Management is actively pursuing financing options including additional sales under the ATM Program  potential warrant exercises  and strategic transactions.Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities  and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.Given the Company’s historical operating losses and reliance on external financings  the Company may still seek additional capital for future needs through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings  collaborations  licensing agreements  and other funding options. While recent financing events have improved the Company’s financial position  access to additional capital in the future remains subject to market conditions and investor interest.In millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP nine months ended September 30  2025 2024 Net cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 32.5 141.4 Net cash flow used in operating activities (86.0) (92.2) Net cash flow used in investing activities (0.7) (1.5) Net cash flow provided by / (used in) financing activities 117.1 (0.1) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents 6.9 (1.1) Net cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period 69.8 46.4Operating ActivitiesOur net cash flows used in operating activities were $86.0 million and $92.2 million during the nine months ended September 30  2025 and 2024  respectively. Net cash flows used in operating activities decreased by $6.2 million as our costs and expenses have been contained and payment terms extended during the period covered by this report.Investing ActivitiesNet cash flows used in investing activities were $0.7 million and $1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30  2025 and 2024  respectively. The variance is primarily explained by capitalized costs for the headquarters move to Châtillon.Financing ActivitiesNet cash flows from financing activities were $117.1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2025 compared to $(88) thousand for the nine months ended September 30  2024.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT – CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding DBV’s financial condition  forecast of its cash runway  the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™.

Nokia intends to accelerate development of Nokia’s 5G & 6G RAN software to run on NVIDIA’s architecture and will make investments to drive Nokia’s strategic goal of increasing its presence in the AI & Cloud market with data center aligned networking solutions within its Network Infrastructure business. Nokia and NVIDIA have agreed to collaborate on AI networking solutions and explore opportunities to incorporate Nokia’s data center switching and optical technologies in NVIDIA’s future AI infrastructure architecture.Nokia will host a press and investor conference call on 28 October 2025 at 3:30pm EST (7:30pm GMT  9:30pm EET) to discuss both the strategic partnership and the purpose of the investment.Details of the equity investmentSubject to certain customary closing conditions  NVIDIA will subscribe for the new shares at a price of USD 6.01 (EUR 5.16) per share  equating to an effective capital contribution to Nokia of approximately USD 1.0 billion (EUR 0.86 billion). All amounts denominated in USD have been converted into EUR using the USD/EUR exchange reference rate published by the European Central Bank for 27 October 2025  which was 0.8591 (USD 1 being EUR 0.8591). The subscription price shall be recorded in Nokia's reserve for invested unrestricted equity. The directed share issuance is an essential part of the strategic partnership with NVIDIA.The subscription price has been determined as part of the negotiations between Nokia and NVIDIA. In addition to its own assessment of the strategic partnership  Nokia has taken independent legal and financial advice to assist in its evaluation of the fairness to Nokia of the terms of the share issuance  taking into account the strategic partnership. In the assessment of Nokia  the strategic partnership  including the share issuance  benefits Nokia and its shareholders  and therefore there is a weighty financial reason for deviating from the pre-emptive rights of the shareholders of Nokia in the share issuance.The Nokia shares will be delivered to NVIDIA in the form of American Depositary Shares.Nokia expects that the new shares will be registered with the Finnish Trade Register in November and be entered in the book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Finland promptly thereafter. The total number of Nokia shares following the share issuance and registration of the new shares is expected to be 5 742 239 696. The new shares represent approximately 2.98% of the total number of Nokia shares prior to the share issuance and approximately 2.90% of the total number of Nokia shares following the share issuance. After their registration with the Finnish Trade Register  the new shares are expected to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki and Euronext Paris together with other Nokia shares  and on the New York Stock Exchange  in the form of American Depositary Shares.The resolution to issue shares is based on the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2025.AdvisorsJ.P.

The chipmaking gian…,Nokia gains 17% after massive $1 billion NVIDIA dealThe tech giants are joining forces to advance artificial intelligence and telecommunications technologyNokia experienced a remarkable day on the stock market as shares of the Finnish telecommunications company skyrocketed 17% in Helsinki trading following the announcement of a major investment from artificial intelligence powerhouse NVIDIA.The chipmaking giant revealed plans to invest $1 billion in Nokia as part of a newly formed strategic partnership that will see the two technology leaders collaborate on advancing artificial intelligence applications in telecommunications and data center networking. Trading of Nokia’s American Depositary Receipts was temporarily halted in New York before the companies made their announcement public.The investment structureUnder the terms of the agreement  NVIDIA will purchase 166 389 351 newly issued Nokia shares at a price of $6.01 per share. This investment will give the AI chipmaker a 2.90% ownership stake in the telecommunications company  establishing NVIDIA as a significant shareholder with a vested interest in Nokia’s future success.The directed share issuance represents approximately 2.98% of Nokia’s total outstanding shares before the new stock enters the market. Company officials expect to complete the transaction in November once registration formalities are finalized with the Finnish Trade Register. Following completion  the new shares will be admitted for trading on three major exchanges: Nasdaq Helsinki  Euronext Paris  and the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares.What Nokia plans to do with the moneyNokia has outlined specific plans for deploying the substantial capital injection from NVIDIA. The company intends to accelerate its strategic initiatives focused on advancing what it describes as trusted connectivity for the AI supercycle  a term referring to the explosive growth expected in artificial intelligence applications across industries.1. Nokia will speed up development of its 5G and 6G Radio Access Network software to ensure compatibility with NVIDIA’s advanced architecture. Radio Access Networks  commonly abbreviated as RAN  represent the critical infrastructure that connects individual devices to mobile networks. By optimizing this software to work seamlessly with NVIDIA’s technology  Nokia positions itself at the intersection of next-generation wireless connectivity and artificial intelligence.2. The company plans to expand its presence in the artificial intelligence and cloud computing markets through enhanced data center networking solutions. As businesses worldwide invest heavily in AI capabilities  the demand for robust data center infrastructure continues growing rapidly. Nokia aims to capture a larger share of this lucrative market segment.The collaborative partnershipBeyond the financial investment  the partnership involves active collaboration between the two companies on multiple fronts. Nokia and NVIDIA will work together on developing AI networking solutions that leverage the strengths of both organizations. They’ll also explore opportunities to incorporate Nokia’s data center switching technology and optical networking capabilities into NVIDIA’s future AI infrastructure designs.This collaboration reflects the increasing convergence between telecommunications infrastructure and artificial intelligence systems. As AI applications become more sophisticated and widespread  they require faster  more reliable networking capabilities to function effectively. The partnership positions both companies to capitalize on this trend.Board approval and shareholder considerationsNokia’s Board of Directors formally approved the investment  determining that the company had a weighty financial reason to deviate from standard procedures that would typically give existing shareholders pre-emptive rights to purchase new shares. The board concluded that the strategic benefits of the partnership  including the equity investment from NVIDIA  serve the best interests of both Nokia and its current shareholders.This decision suggests Nokia’s leadership views the partnership as transformative enough to justify diluting existing ownership slightly in exchange for the capital and strategic advantages NVIDIA brings to the table.What this means for the technology landscapeThe partnership between Nokia and NVIDIA represents a significant development in the race to build the infrastructure that will power the next generation of artificial intelligence applications. While NVIDIA has established itself as the dominant player in AI chips  Nokia brings decades of expertise in telecommunications equipment and networking technology.Together  the companies aim to shape and lead the AI-RAN market  which combines artificial intelligence capabilities with radio access network technology. This emerging field promises to make wireless networks smarter  more efficient and better able to handle the massive data demands of AI applications.The partnership also supports Nokia’s efforts to remain competitive in an industry facing rapid technological change. As telecommunications evolve beyond traditional voice and data services toward becoming the backbone of AI-powered services  Nokia’s collaboration with a leader like NVIDIA helps ensure the company stays relevant and competitive.For NVIDIA  the investment represents a strategic move beyond its core chip business into the broader ecosystem of AI infrastructure  gaining influence over how next-generation telecommunications networks are designed and deployed.,positive,0.83,0.17,0.0,mixed,0.61,0.28,0.12,True,English,"['massive $1 billion NVIDIA deal', 'Nokia', 'faster, more reliable networking capabilities', '6G Radio Access Network software', 'radio access network technology', 'data center networking solutions', 'robust data center infrastructure', 'data center switching technology', 'massive $1 billion NVIDIA deal', 'future AI infrastructure designs', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Radio Access Networks', 'massive data demands', 'optical networking capabilities', 'AI networking solutions', 'American Depositary Receipts', 'Finnish Trade Register', 'cloud computing markets', 'artificial intelligence capabilities', 'three major exchanges', 'weighty financial reason', 'artificial intelligence powerhouse', 'artificial intelligence systems', 'total outstanding shares', 'American Depositary Shares', 'two technology leaders', 'substantial capital injection', 'next-generation wireless connectivity', 'lucrative market segment', 'artificial intelligence applications', 'Finnish telecommunications company', 'networking technology', 'AI capabilities', 'new stock', 'future success', 'AI applications', 'wireless networks', 'stock market', 'critical infrastructure', 'telecommunications infrastructure', 'telecommunications technology', 'technology landscape', 'new shares', 'trusted connectivity', 'AI chipmaker', 'AI supercycle', 'AI chips', 'mobile networks', 'major investment', 'financial investment', 'tech giants', 'remarkable day', 'chipmaking giant', '2.90% ownership stake', 'significant shareholder', 'vested interest', 'registration formalities', 'Nasdaq Helsinki', 'Euronext Paris', 'strategic initiatives', 'explosive growth', 'advanced architecture', 'individual devices', 'multiple fronts', 'increasing convergence', 'shareholder considerations', 'standard procedures', 'existing shareholders', 'pre-emptive rights', 'strategic benefits', 'best interests', 'current shareholders', 'existing ownership', 'strategic advantages', 'next generation', 'dominant player', 'telecommunications equipment', 'AI-RAN market', 'emerging field', 'two companies', 'investment structure', 'share issuance', 'Company officials', 'larger share', 'equity investment', 'specific plans', 'active collaboration', 'significant development', 'Helsinki trading', 'Board approval', 'strategic partnership', 'collaborative partnership', 'Nokia shares', 'forces', 'announcement', 'The', 'terms', 'agreement', '166,389,351 newly', 'price', 'transaction', 'November', 'completion', 'money', 'industries', '5G', 'compatibility', 'intersection', 'presence', 'businesses', 'strengths', 'organizations', 'opportunities', 'trend', 'Directors', 'decision', 'leadership', 'table', 'race', 'decades', 'expertise', 'efforts']",2025-10-28,2025-10-29,rollingout.com

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRSIAS 29: impact on reported dataDanone has applied IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries  as defined in IFRS. Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires their non-monetary assets and liabilities and their income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of their functional currencies  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position  included in the net income. Moreover  their financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data Q3 2025 Sales (€ million) +13.8 Sales growth (%) +0.20%Breakdown by quarter of 9M 2025 sales after application of IAS 299M 2025 sales correspond to the addition of:Q3 2025 reported sales;Q1 and Q2 2025 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until September 30  2025  to sales of entities in hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until September 30  2025  and translation into euros using the September 30  2025  closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data)Sales after application of IAS 29 (€ million) Q1 20251 Q2 20252 Q3 2025 9M 2025 BY GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE Europe 2 389 2 505 2 481 7 375 North America 1 633 1 546 1 577 4 757 China  North Asia & Oceania 936 1 080 1 032 3 048 Latin America 686 704 676 2 066 Asia  Middle East & Africa 1 167 1 055 1 111 3 332BY CATEGORY EDP 3 359 3 239 3 255 9 853 Specialized Nutrition 2 298 2 307 2 299 6 904 Waters 1 155 1 345 1 322 3 822 Total 6 811 6 891 6 876 20 5781Results from the application of IAS 29 until September 30  2025  to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.2Results from the application of IAS 29 until September 30  2025  to Q2 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Definitions of geographical zonesEurope refers to European countries.North America refers to the United States and Canada.China  North Asia & Oceania refers to China  Japan  Australia and New-Zealand.Latin America refers to Mexico  Brazil  Argentina and Uruguay.Asia  Middle East & Africa refers to refers to Asia  Middle East including Turkey  Africa and CIS (zone previously called “Rest of the World”).Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material.Like-for-like changes in sales reflect Danone's organic performance and essentially exclude the impact of:changes in consolidation scope  with indicators related to a given fiscal year calculated on the basis of the previous year's scope;changes in applicable accounting principles;changes in exchange rates  with both previous-year and current-year indicators calculated using the same exchange rate (the exchange rate used is a projected annual rate determined by Danone for the current year and applied to both previous and current years).Since January 1st  2023  all countries with hyperinflationary economies are taken into account in like-for-like changes as follows: sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger the application of hyperinflationary accounting as defined in IFRS) is now excluded from the like-for-like sales growth calculation.Bridge from like-for-like data to reported data(€ million except %) 2024 sales Like-for-like change Impact of changesin scope of consolidation Impact of changes in exchange rates & others incl.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include:capital gains and losses on disposals of businesses and fully consolidated companies;under IAS 36  impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructuring operations or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to crises and major disputes;in connection with IFRS 3 and IFRS 10  (i) acquisition costs related to acquisitions of companies resulting in control  (ii) revaluation gains or losses accounted for following a loss of control  and (iii) changes in earn-outs subsequent to acquisitions resulting in control.Recurring operating margin is defined as the Recurring operating income over Sales ratio.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Danone that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
