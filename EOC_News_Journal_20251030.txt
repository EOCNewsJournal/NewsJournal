Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2025  which have not been subject to a review by the Statutory Auditors.ON-GOING INTERNATIONAL TENSIONSWhile the first months of 2025 were marked by escalating trade tensions  customs duties have become a tool of pressure in broader international negotiations.Indeed  since June  several bilateral agreements and various exemptions have been announced  temporarily easing trade tensions - except with China  India  and Mexico  three countries that are important for the Group. Discussions remain ongoing  with an extended deadline to finalize lasting agreements.Furthermore  China’s tightening of controls over rare earth elements has led to renewed tensions with the United States  which on 13 October announced additional tariffs of 100% against China.Thus  as of the end of September 2025  the agreements have not been stabilized  leaving the situation highly fragile.Direct impacts of tariffs for Lectra are under controlAs announced in July  European or Chinese exports of equipment  consumables and parts to the United States account for less than 10% of Lectra’s revenues.The Group has repeatedly adjusted its price lists to reflect the impact of tariffs in China and the United States for equipment  consumables and parts  and maintenance contracts. It has also rerouted certain shipments to Mexico and removed several products from the Chinese and American catalogs to avoid customs formalities.Indirect impacts are closely tied to customers’ wait-and-see behaviorWhether in fashion  automotive  or furniture  tariffs have so far resulted in little competitive distortion or industrial relocation. However  changes cannot be ruled out in the coming months. Disruptions continue  and uncertainty remains  especially for Mexico  China  and India.Furthermore  an increase in import costs for American companies and a rise in inflation driven by tariffs are to be feared in the coming months.The need to diversify sourcing and countries of origin is more relevant than ever for all companies concerned. In the medium and long term  this could imply additional production capacities and represent business opportunities for Lectra.2. Q3 2025Despite the continued cautiousness of customers  the third quarter saw a less pronounced decline in new systems orders than in the second quarter (-15% like-for-like after -27% in Q2).Revenues for the third quarter of 2025 declined by 4% on a like-for-like basis.

ASSESSMENT OF THE 2023-2025 STRATEGIC ROADMAPLaunched in 2017  the Lectra 4.0 strategy aims to position the Group as a key Industry 4.0 player in its three strategic market sectors: fashion  automotive and furniture  before 2030. The strategy has been implemented up to now through three strategic roadmaps.The first strategic roadmap  which covered the 2017-2019 period  established the key fundamentals for the future of the Group. The second roadmap  which ran from 2020 through 2022  achieved a new dimension for the Group – primarily through the acquisition of Gerber in June 2021.Over the third roadmap  from 2023 to 2025  Lectra made decisive progress toward its Lectra 4.0 vision  guided by six strategic priorities: (1) Reinforce implementation of ethical  social  societal and environmental best practices both internally and for customers  (2) Leverage all synergies arising from the Gerber acquisition  (3) Accelerate the transition of software sales to the SaaS model  (4) Accelerate the transformation of the Group’s customer relationship and customer engagement model  (5) Pursue external growth  (6) Prepare Lectra for the 2026-2030 period.The strategic roadmap was executed with discipline and ambition. It delivered a wide range of solid results - notably a threefold increase in SaaS revenues  deeper integration of sustainability across operations  and enhanced financial resilience. These achievements were complemented by significant progress in other areas  including organizational transformation  innovation  and customer-centricity.The consistent improvement of Lectra’s financial indicators since 2023  supported by steady growth in recurring revenues  rigorous cost management  as well as the success and effective integration of targeted acquisitions  demonstrates the strength of the Group’s performance. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  the success of Lectra’s various offers confirms the relevance of its strategic choices since 2017.The detailed assessment of the 2023-2025 roadmap can be found in the Quarterly Financial Information as of 30 September 2025  published on 29 October 2025  to which reference should be made.5. OUTLOOK2025 has proven to be an unprecedented year in terms of macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  marked by successive announcements since March that have led most of the Group’s customers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude  regardless of market or geographic region.Lectra has continued to pursue its strategy  which has demonstrated its relevance through the development of its SaaS business  despite the adverse context.In July 2025  the lack of visibility led the Group not to reiterate its annual targets announced in February 2025. Today  the situation still calls for caution. The Group therefore cannot commit to specific targets and is focusing on the future  accelerating its transformation to seize every opportunity that may arise in a normalized environment  both in terms of organic and external growth.This year marks the completion of the final stage of its 2023–2025 strategic roadmap. The Group’s ambitions for the next three years  in line with its long-term vision  will be detailed in the 2026–2028 strategic roadmap  which will be presented on February 12  2026. The Group will rely on its strong fundamentals to drive this new phase of its development.The 2024 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for the first nine months of 2025 are available on lectra.com.

Collectively  these data provide strong evidence of VYVGART’s potential to improve outcomes across the full spectrum of gMG patient populations.“Our latest data reflect argenx’ ambition to deliver transformational impact for all people living with MG globally with rapid and significant functional improvements sustained over time  regardless of MG disease subtype ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “Each new VYVGART study in MG is contributing to redefining treatment standards for patients seeking to regain quality of life and return to normal daily activities – a significant proportion of whom achieve this standard. And we’re not done yet.”First dedicated study to date of AChR-Ab seronegative gMG confirms VYVGART’s potential to be a targeted  effective  and safe treatment for patients living with gMG  regardless of autoantibody status (MGFA Oral Presentation #101)The Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study met its primary endpoint (p-value=0.0068)  demonstrating that AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients treated with VYVGART achieved a statistically significant improvement in MG-ADL (Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living) total score compared to placebo after four weeks.In the overall population  mean change from baseline in patients treated with VYVGART was a clinically meaningful 3.35 point improvement in MG-ADL total score at week 4. These positive results in MG-ADL score mean patients experienced significant improvements in one or a combination of their abilities in breathing  eating  eyesight and motor functions.Improvements in MG-ADL and QMG (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score) among patients treated with VYVGART were increasingly pronounced across subsequent treatment cycles in the overall population and in all patient subgroups – MuSK+  LRP4+  triple seronegative gMG.VYVGART was well tolerated across AChR-Ab seronegative subtypes and consistent with the established safety profile in patients with AChR-Ab seropositive gMG and other indications. No new safety concerns were identified.Results from the ongoing ADAPT SERON study indicate that pathogenic IgGs are an underlying driver of gMG across patient subtypes  regardless of autoantibody status.argenx plans to share these results with the U.S. FDA and seek expansion of the VYVGART label to include adult AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients across all three subtypes.“The ADAPT SERON trial showed that efgartigimod generated tangible improvements in daily functioning  marking an important advancement for the field and for seronegative patients seeking better disease control. Patients with seronegative gMG  in particular  have historically lacked effective treatment options. Collectively  these findings highlight that efgartigimod has the potential to deliver meaningful and progressive benefits for patients regardless of antibody status  with its therapeutic impact strengthening through continued treatment ” said James F. Howard Jr.  M.D.  Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease)  Medicine and Allied Health  Department of Neurology  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and Principal Investigator for the ADAPT SERON trial.Addressing Unmet Need in Adolescent gMG Patients (MGFA Oral Presentation #113)Interim results from the Phase 2/3 ADAPT Jr study showed that VYVGART improved outcomes in adolescents (ages 12–17) with gMG  offering the potential to address a patient population with high unmet needs. Reduction in total IgG and AChR-Ab levels were similar to outcomes in adult gMG patients. VYVGART was well-tolerated and had a favorable safety profile.Reducing Steroid Use in Real-World Practice (MGFA Oral Presentation #100)A retrospective cohort study using real-world evidence showed that long-term VYVGART treatment was associated with substantial and progressive reductions in oral glucocorticoid (GC) use among adults with gMG. A majority of patients (72.5%) achieved meaningful steroid tapering – defined as at least a 1 mg per day reduction from baseline.At 18 months  the average daily GC dose for patients receiving VYVGART decreased by more than 50% (from 16.6 to 7.5 mg/day)  with most patients (55%) receiving an average daily GC dose of 5 mg/day or less  and 30% of patients receiving no GC. Improvements in MG-ADL scores of ~5 points were observed among patients with available data  supporting the clinical benefit of steroid tapering alongside maintained disease control.Demonstrating Sustained MSE and Favorable Safety Profile in Long-Term Treatment (AANEM Poster Presentation #12)Final results from the ADAPT-SC+ open-label extension study demonstrated that VYVGART SC was well-tolerated during 459.4 participant-years of follow-up and up to 33 treatment cycles.Clinically meaningful improvements in mean MG-ADL total scores were observed in AChR-Ab+ participants as early as Week 1 and were sustained through Week 163. 59.2% of AChR-Ab+ participants achieved MSE (MG-ADL score of 0 or 1) at least once  while 88.1% of those sustained minimal symptom expression for at least 4 weeks. No new safety signals were identified with long-term use.More information on the data presented at the 2025 AANEM Annual Meeting can be found here.Important Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.

VYVGART® Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa (VYVGART) and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. VYVGART is approved for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and immune thrombocytopenia (Japan only). VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for gMG and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART Hytrulo may be marketed under different proprietary names in other regions.ADAPT SERON Study DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adults with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG (n=119) across North America  Europe  China  and the Middle East. Part A randomized participants (1:1) received 4 once-weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV or placebo  followed by a 5-week follow-up and primary analysis. Part B is an open-label extension: participants receive 2 fixed cycles of 4 once-weekly efgartigimod infusions (4-week interval between cycles); from cycle 3 onward  additional cycles could be started ≥1 week after the last administration of the previous cycle  based on clinical status. The primary endpoint is the MG-ADL total score change from baseline to day 29 in part A. Other scales of evaluation include QMG  MG-QoL 15r  MGC  and EQ-5D-5L VAS. Enrolled participants had a confirmed MG diagnosis by an independent panel of experts  and an MG-ADL total score of 5 or greater. Participants were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs. Participants were eligible to enroll in ADAPT SERON if they were AChR-Ab seronegative  which included participants who are MuSK-Ab seropositive  LRP4-Ab seropositive  or triple seronegative.MG-ADL is a validated measure of disease activity in patients living with myasthenia gravis  which evaluates the functional impact of symptoms on daily activities such as speaking  chewing  swallowing  breathing  and limb strength.ADAPT Jr Study DesignADAPT Jr is an ongoing  open-label  multi-center clinical trial evaluating VYVGART in juvenile patients (ages 2 to <18 years) with anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). The trial includes sites across the United States  Canada  and Europe. Key assessments include pharmacokinetics  immunogenicity  safety  tolerability  and clinical effect measured by MG-ADL  QMG  EQ-5D-Y  and pediatric fatigue scores. The primary objective is to confirm age-appropriate dosing; secondary endpoints include evaluating efgartigimod’s safety and activity in children and adolescents living with gMG.IQVIA Real-World Steroid Tapering Study DesignThe IQVIA steroid tapering study is a retrospective  real-world analysis evaluating changes in oral glucocorticoid (GC) use among adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who initiated and continued VYVGART for at least 18 months. Patients were identified using the U.S. IQVIA Longitudinal Access and Adjudication Data (LAAD) medical and pharmacy claims database between April 2016 and January 2025. MG-ADL (Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living) data were integrated from the My VYVGART Path patient support program to provide additional clinical context. Glucocorticoid average daily dose (ADD) was evaluated at multiple time points  including baseline (90 days prior to therapy) and 18 months after starting VYVGART. The study included 168 adults (mean age: 59.7 years; 44% female) with chronic GC use prior to VYVGART initiation. Glucocorticoid average daily dose (ADD) was assessed at baseline (90 days pre-VYVGART) and at 18 months (days 515–545 post-initiation). This study provides real-world insights into steroid tapering practices and treatment outcomes among VYVGART-treated gMG patients in the United States.ADAPT-SC+ Study DesignADAPT-SC+ is a Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety  tolerability  and efficacy of VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who previously completed the ADAPT-SC or ADAPT+ studies. Participants received individualized treatment cycles of subcutaneous efgartigimod PH20  with flexible intervals based on clinical need  for up to 33 cycles and over 459.4 participant-years of follow-up. The study’s primary objectives were to assess the long-term safety and sustained clinical effectiveness of VYVGART Hytrulo in a real-world  antibody-positive gMG population. Efficacy was primarily evaluated using the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  a validated measure of disease impact on everyday function.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months¹  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About AChR-Ab seronegative gMGgMG is a rare  chronic  neuromuscular autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic IgGs targeting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission and debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Approximately 80% of patients with gMG have detectable antibodies against the AChR in sera  and these patients are diagnosed as AChR-Ab seropositive gMG. Approximately 20% of patients with gMG do not have detectable serum antibodies directed against AChR and are referred to as AChR-Ab seronegative gMG. These patients may have detectable autoantibodies targeting other NMJ proteins  such as muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4)  or others. Anti-MuSK antibodies are detected in approximately 1-10% of patients with gMG  while anti-LRP4 antibodies are detected in approximately 1-5% of patients with gMG. About 10% of patients do not have any detectable autoantibodies against AChR  MuSK or LRP4. These triple seronegative patients have historically been excluded from studies and have a higher disease burden and unmet medical need compared to patients with detectable autoantibodies. Currently  there are no approved treatments available for patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies or for triple seronegative patients.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.
