However  after Belgium blocked the initiative  the European Council pledged last week to explore other options to cover Kiev’s needs for the next two years.“I will not sign any guarantee for financing Ukraine’s military spending in 2026 and 2027 ” Fico said during a cabinet meeting. “Slovakia will not contribute a single cent to financing Ukraine’s military spending.”Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has been one of the most outspoken critics of the “reparation loan” proposal  warning that the unprecedented “sort-of-confiscation” of sovereign assets would expose Belgium to massive liabilities. “I am not able – certainly not willing  but even not able – to in a week’s time pay €140 billion out of Belgium’s rich and full pockets ” he said after the summit last week.Ukraine’s government relies heavily on foreign assistance to sustain its military operations in the conflict with Russia  as its forces continue to suffer from manpower shortages and mass desertions. Kiev’s backers are reportedly considering direct contributions from member states to refill its war chest.Moscow has repeatedly accused European officials of prolonging the conflict “to the last Ukrainian ” arguing that the policy only serves weapons manufacturers and shields Western leaders from accountability for their failed approach to the crisis.,neutral,0.0,0.8,0.19,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,True,English,"['EU member', 'single cent', 'Ukraine', 'military', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico', 'Belgium-based Euroclear clearinghouse', 'next two years', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'reparation loan” proposal', 'Russian assets', 'sovereign assets', 'war effort', 'military aid', 'European Council', 'other options', 'military spending', 'cabinet meeting', 'single cent', 'outspoken critics', 'unprecedented “sort', 'massive liabilities', 'full pockets', 'foreign assistance', 'military operations', 'manpower shortages', 'mass desertions', 'direct contributions', 'member states', 'war chest', 'European officials', 'last Ukrainian', 'weapons manufacturers', 'Western leaders', 'EU plan', 'Kiev', 'Slovakia', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'Wednesday', 'failure', 'collateral', 'initiative', 'needs', 'guarantee', 'confiscation', 'week', 'time', 'rich', 'summit', 'government', 'conflict', 'forces', 'backers', 'Moscow', 'policy', 'accountability', 'approach', 'crisis']",2025-10-30,2025-10-31,rt.com

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy  or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F and amendment thereto for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 30  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Our revenues were led by lower volatility and fewer trading opportunities overall. Nevertheless  we were able to generate a solid EBITDA margin of 24% in the quarter.We continue to execute on our key strategic initiatives in the quarter. Our Trading Capital Expansion Plan significantly advanced as we secured a $200 million private credit facility and a $75 million revolving credit facility. We also expanded our funding facilities for Asia  which is a key target region for us.We remain committed to our technology transformation to support greater volumes  improve our quantitative capabilities and enhance operational efficiency.In the traditional ETP industry  maintaining and growing market share will be a key focus for us in our strategic markets. We also see significant innovation in terms of products and distribution channels creating new opportunities as we remain at the forefront of these transformations.In Digital Assets  we remain a leader in the build-up of this once in a generation opportunity. For example  we are participating in exciting developments in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA)  partnering with new platforms to enable 24/7 trading of tokenized U.S. equities. We are also supporting an increase in options trading in cryptocurrencies as more exchanges start offering these instruments.We expect to be able to fully support 24/7 trading for all our partners across TradFi and DeFi markets soon.For the past two months  I have focused on meeting our employees and key stakeholders. I have been impressed and energized by the talent  commitment  and ambition I have seen throughout the organization and the support for our growth agenda has been truly energizing.Over the coming months  with the support of the Board and the rest of the leadership team  I plan to develop an ambitious growth strategy and execution plan which we will present at our Capital Markets Day next year.”Preliminary Financial Calendar12 February 2026 4Q25 and FY25 ResultsAnalyst Conference Call and WebcastThe 3Q25 trading update analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CET on Thursday  30 October 2025.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Accor  New Zealand’s largest h...,The potential for future growth in international and domestic travel has prompted an expansion of Accor’s New Zealand hotel network  including the launch of two new brands into the country within a month of each other.Accor  New Zealand’s largest hotel operator  now operates 49 hotels and 6 200+ rooms nationwide with the addition of TRIBE Auckland Fort Street and JO&JOE Auckland.New brands redefine Auckland’s hospitality sceneTRIBE Auckland Fort Street opened on 14 October and will soon be joined by JO&JOE Auckland - which is part of Ennismore  the fastest-growing lifestyle hospitality company - just around the corner on Fort Street in early November.Ennismore is in a joint venture with Accor  which holds a majority shareholding.These two brands bring fresh perspectives to Auckland’s accommodation scene  appealing to new generations of travellers with design-driven and community-minded concepts.TRIBE has already made its mark across Australia  Asia and Europe with its bold  design-led experience at affordable prices. TRIBE Auckland Fort Street thrives with energy  offering inviting spaces to work  relax  or connect. Sienna restaurant sits at the centre  serving a sun-soaked So-Cal menu of tacos  shareable plates  and vibrant dishes. Lounge areas  communal tables  and cosy nooks make it perfect for coffee  cocktails  and city-side gatherings.Ennismore’s JO&JOE redefines the hostel experience. Launched in France in 2017  the brand blends the best of hotels  hostels  and private rentals to meet the expectations of modern  social travellers. Following its expansion across Europe and Brazil  JO&JOE Auckland will be the brand’s first opening in Asia Pacific.Set on Auckland’s Fort Street  the new property brings a contemporary twist to the hostel scene - blending spontaneity  affordability  and social connection for the next generation of travellers. It will offer a mix of 75 dorm-style and private rooms  totalling 293 beds  along with a rooftop bar and communal spaces.Both properties are owned by Accor’s long-time New Zealand partner  CP Group.Accor’s growth momentum will continue into 2026  with the opening of Pullman Hamilton  a 191-key hotel being developed by Mistry Centre Ltd that expands the Group’s premium footprint in the Waikato region.Accor NZ hotel performanceNew Zealand occupancy for the remainder of 2025 is 1.5% higher than for the same period last year  with Queenstown benefiting strongly from a 13% year-on-year increase in Australian arrivals to New Zealand (as of September) and growth in small and large meetings  as well as corporate travel across all months.Auckland occupancy has also increased  though has fluctuated according to events  with sport and concerts spiking demand.Looking ahead  Accor is well-positioned to benefit from the opening of the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC) in February 2026. The new centre is expected to generate significant demand for hotel accommodation in Auckland  helping absorb recent growth in supply and supporting occupancy and rate performance across the city.Forecasts for 2026 show that occupancy is ahead 3.5% compared to 2025  with Auckland’s performance driven by leisure groups across all months  and by the Jehovah’s Witness global event being held at Ellerslie in January  which is expected to attract thousands of visitors in a traditionally off-peak month. Conference and leisure travel is also boosting forecast occupancies for Accor’s Wellington hotels in 2026.Confidence in a growing tourism marketWhile there is no denying that the current economic situation in New Zealand is challenging  the weakened NZ dollar and the country’s continued reputation as a prime destination to visit are seeing strong growth in international tourism – and we remain confident this will continue.International air capacity is almost back to pre-Covid levels and Australian arrivals to New Zealand are at record levels  which has particularly boosted travel to Queenstown and the South Island. It is also encouraging that international flights to Hamilton have recommenced after 13 years  as we will open a Pullman hotel in the city next year in addition to our existing Novotel and ibis hotels.This potential for growth is why we are focused on strengthening our presence in international gateway markets  diversifying our portfolio  and investing in communities across the country.We are particularly excited about our two new hotel launches in Auckland  as they will see the debut of new brands in New Zealand  and both brands tap into new and emerging markets.There is no doubt that design-led hotels that place greater emphasis on making guests feel ‘at home’ by providing more vibrant living spaces are what travellers want today. TRIBE will reshape the traditional hotel experience  enabling guests to live  work and play in contemporary interiors.The debut of JO&JOE by Ennismore in New Zealand will be a game-changer as this brand totally elevates the hostel experience and will resonate strongly with international visitors who want the benefits of a communal hospitality stay but with quality accommodation and facilities.The past few years have seen substantial growth in our network  adding the Te Arikinui Pullman Auckland Airport and also Wairakei Resort Taupō  following our partnership with Bayview International Hotels & Resorts.We are also seeing great interest in extended stay accommodation. Brands such as Peppers  The Sebel  and Mantra continue to perform well  with properties such as The Sebel Wellington Lower Hutt and Mantra Lake Tekapo delivering exceptional guest experiences. With over 10 000 rooms across this segment in Australasia  extended stay is a natural growth area.With new brands  strong and established partnerships with local owners  renewed energy  and a deep connection to place  we believe the future of hospitality in New Zealand is bright. Accor Pacific Chief Operating Officer  Adrian WilliamsReviving domestic tourism through major eventsWhile Accor remains confident in international visitor growth  Williams said investment in major events is vital to reigniting domestic tourism.The forecast for international tourism is positive  but domestic tourism remains subdued and we believe that stronger investment in attracting major events and conferences is essential to reignite the local tourism and hospitality sector.It’s encouraging to see the Government take decisive action with the NZ$70 million boost for major events and tourism. This is very positive news for the tourism and accommodation sector  which depends on a steady pipeline of events to support jobs  stimulate local economies  and showcase New Zealand on the world stage.Guests increasingly treat major events as non-discretionary leisure experiences - they’ll travel for them  extend their stay  and make the most of the opportunity.New Zealand has a proud track record with world-class events like the Rugby World Cup and America’s Cup  and we’d love to see more major sporting tournaments  international music tours  business conventions  and cultural festivals attracted here. It’s also important that these events aren’t limited to the main centres - regional destinations stand to benefit greatly from increased visitation.The reality is that securing large-scale events requires forward planning and investment. It can take several years to win hosting rights  but the long-term benefits are undeniable - they showcase New Zealand on the world stage  drive repeat visitation  and encourage new business and leisure travel.From luxury to economy  Accor operates more than 400 hotels in the Pacific region under renowned brands such as Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s SO/  Mondrian  25hours  Hyde and JO&JOE.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience to reference Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The terms “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; “aspire”; “aspiration”; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; “desire”; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; “vision”; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks  including climate change; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including tariffs and regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East  and a significant cyber security  data privacy or IT incident; (n) the pace of the energy transition; and (o) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F and amendment thereto for the year ended December 31  2024 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 30  2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period  respectively  and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly  the outlook reflects our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio  efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Consolidated shipments(1) totaled 1.3 million units  up 13% (152 000 units)  with most of the increase due to a 35% improvement in North America reflecting the benefits of normalized inventory dynamics  compared to the prior year in which the U.S. dealer stock reduction initiative temporarily decreased production.Progressing Product LaunchesBy the end of Q3  six of the ten new vehicles planned for 2025 introduction were successfully launched. Additional launches in the fourth quarter will reintroduce several volume nameplates which exemplify important  decisive changes already made in the Company's strategy to provide customers with greater freedom to choose the cars and the configurations they want.

This trend was evidenced across the Jeep®  Ram  Chrysler  and Dodge brands - taking the Company to a monthly market share of 8.7% in September  the highest in 15 months. Another milestone in September was the return to market of the HEMI® V-8-powered Ram 1500.In Enlarged Europe  several recently introduced models  including the Citroën C3  C3 Aircross  Opel/Vauxhall Frontera and Fiat Grande Panda  supported an improved market share in the B-segment  underpinned by increased production. Net revenues rose 4% compared to the prior year period. Market share in EU30 fell to 15.4%  affected by market declines in France and Italy  where Stellantis has greater exposure and a moderately lower market share in the LCV segment.Outside North America and Enlarged Europe  Stellantis delivered solid commercial results.

Also  importantly  Ontex is becoming stronger and seeing significant opportunities which makes me excited as we look to the future.”Q3 2025 resultsRevenue was €445 million  a 3.8% like-for-like decrease versus the third quarter of 2024. Volumes were 3.9% lower  which is overall in line with softer consumer demand for retailer brands in the quarter.

While sales prices  including mix  were stable  volumes were lower  in line with softer consumer demand for retailer brands in the quarter. Compared to the second quarter revenue grew 3.7% thanks to new contracts in baby care.Volumes were down 3.9%. Baby care volumes were 11% lower  which was overall in line with softer demand in the quarter  especially for retailer brands  which continue to be affected by intense promotional activities by A-brands in certain countries. While Ontex’s volumes in North America were down  they outperformed market demand due to the start-up of new contract gains in the retail channel. Contract manufacturing dropped significantly  however. In Europe  baby care volumes were also lower  except for baby pants. Positively  in contrast to the second quarter  customer destocking and supply chain disruptions did not have an impact  as these came to an end. Feminine care sales volumes were up by 5%  outperforming stable market demand for retailer brands. Adult care volumes were up slightly  by 1%  which is less than the continuing demographic-driven growth for adult care in Europe  due to Ontex’s large exposure to the healthcare channel  where demand is more stable and the phasing of new capacity is delayed. Ontex is ramping up  with new capacity becoming operational gradually in the fourth quarter and beyond.Sales prices  including a slightly positive mix effect  were flat year on year across regions and categories. Prices have been largely stable since mid-2024.Forex fluctuations had a 1% adverse effect  mainly due to the depreciation of the British pound  Australian dollar and especially the US dollar versus the same period in 2024.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €51 million  €6 million lower than in 2024  which is fully attributable to the €6 million negative impact from the revenue decrease  while delivery on the cost transformation program fully offset higher raw material prices and operating costs. Compared to the second quarter  adjusted EBITDA improved by €15 million  as a result of the combined effect of revenue recovery and cost optimization.The cost transformation program delivered €16 million net operating savings  leading to an improvement of the operating efficiency by close to 5% year on year. This was the result of optimization efforts in purchasing  supply chain  product innovation and manufacturing  including the transformation of Ontex’s production footprint in Belgium.Raw materials had a €10 million negative impact in the quarter  which was mainly due to year-on-year higher prices for fluff and packaging materials  exacerbated by transient inventory effects.Other operating and SG&A costs were up by €5 million year on year  largely due to inflation of wages and service costs  as well as the costs related to the ramp-up in North America. These were partly offset by efforts made to curtail SG&A costs.Forex fluctuations had a no material net impact.The adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4%  0.6 percentage point lower compared to the third quarter in 2024  and 3.0 percentage point higher compared to the second quarter of 2025.Q3 2025 financial reviewP&LOperating profit from continuing operations was €29 million  compared to €8 million in 2024. While adjusted EBITDA was €6 million lower and depreciation was stable  restructuring charges were only €2 million in the period  consisting primarily of impairment of some old equipment  which compares to €29 million in 2024  when restructuring charges for the Belgian footprint transformation were provisioned.Discontinued operations  consisting of the Turkish business activities  generated a revenue of €23 million and adjusted EBITDA of €2 million. The operating profit from discontinued operations amounted to €1 million  after deduction of divestment-related costs.Balance sheetNet financial debt for the Total Group reduced by €9 million over the quarter from €552 million to €543 million  as a result of positive free cash flow generation. The latter was based on solid EBITDA contribution and capex optimisation efforts  in the absence of significant restructuring cash-out.The leverage ratio remained at 2.7x  reflecting the net debt decrease and the slightly lower last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA.Practical informationDisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

Essential Products experienced weakness in volumes  as customers deferred vitamin orders  with prices under pressure during the quarter.The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11% in the third quarter.

In this context:In July 2025  the Group obtained two unsecured loans of €5m each from Bpifrance  the French public investment bank. These loans have a 4-year maturity and carry attractive annual interest rates of around 4.6%  roughly half the cost of existing debt;In early October 2025  the Group executed a partial bond redemption at 103  as provided for under the bond documentation  using available cash to repurchase $25m of its USD-denominated tranche and €20m ($23m) of its EUR-denominated one. This transaction will generate annual interest savings of approximately $4.5m going forward.Both initiatives will further enhance the Group’s future Net Cash Flow and support its ongoing deleveraging trajectory. As of end-September 2025  Viridien maintained a strong liquidity position  including a $125m RCF4.(in millions of $) Sept. 30  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Change (%) Sept. 30  2024 Change (%) Liquidity 327 392 -17% 442 -26% Cash 227 302 -25% 342 -34% Undrawn RCF 100 90 +11% 100 0% Gross Debt 1 204 1 223 -2% 1 345 -10% Bonds 9885 1 049 -6% 1 143 -14% Other borrowings 42 31 +35% 31 +34% Accrued interests 48 18 +160% 43 +11% Lease liabilities 126 125 +1% 127 -1% Net Debt 977 921 +6% 1 003 -3%OUTLOOKOil prices remain volatile  and short-term fluctuations could prompt some arbitrage or rescheduling of E&P investments should prices temporarily soften. However  exploration and seismic activities are expected to remain resilient  with potential spending cuts more likely to affect other parts of the value chain.Exploration and seismic are supported by structurally positive fundamentals  as E&P operators increasingly recognize the risks to production sustainability in a context of accelerating field depletion and the need to secure long-term resource supply.Building on its strong value proposition  extensive high-quality data library  solid track record  and robust backlog  Viridien looks ahead with confidence in its ability to sustain strong cash generation and advance its deleveraging objectives  starting with the delivery of its $100 million Net Cash Flow target in 2025.***Q3 2025 conference call detailsThe press release and presentation will be made available on www.viridiengroup.com at 5:45 p.m. (CET).An English-language conference call is scheduled today at 6:00 p.m. (CET).Participants must register for the conference call by clicking here to receive a dial-in number and PIN code.

Product revenue rose 10.3%  while recurring activities advanced 13.3%  driven by a 32.1% increase in Customer-managed subscriptions and a 12.7% rise in Own-managed subscriptions. Maintenance fell 26.7% as migrations to recurring models accelerated  and License revenue contracted to €2.5m. Services  at €8.7m (–2.3%)  remained stable  consistent with Axway’s lighter implementation profile.SBS delivered revenue of €90.8m  representing 4.7% organic growth  fully in line with plan. Product revenue climbed 9.3%  driven by a 23.1% increase in Own-managed subscriptions and a 47.7% rise in License sales  partially offset by a 21.8% decrease in Customer-managed subscriptions after a stronger comparison base in 2024. Maintenance grew modestly by 1.5%  confirming the resilience of the installed base. Services revenue declined 6.2% to €24.0m  as the company continues to pivot away from large implementation projects toward standardized  modular software delivery.At Group level  Services totaled €32.7m  down 5.2% organically  mainly due to the normalization of project activity at SBS  while Axway’s contribution remained steady. Services accounted for 19% of total Group revenue  compared with 21% a year earlier  illustrating the progressive shift toward higher-margin  product-based revenue streams and recurring activities.At the end of September 2025  Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for Axway reached €262.8m (+12.2%) and SBS €233.8m (+10.1%)  confirming strong expansion in both portfolios. ARR is now approaching three-quarters of total Group annual revenue  underpinning a highly predictable revenue model and reinforcing the Group’s strategic emphasis on durable  compounding growth.Comments on Q3 2025 product line performanceAxway continues to benefit from resilient enterprise demand for integration  API Management  and secure data movement solutions  as well as expanding adoption of cloud and hybrid deployments. Over the quarter  the shift in product mix was largely attributable to the timing of Customer-managed subscription renewals and upsells and their resulting upfront recognition of revenue.Managed File Transfer reaffirmed its strategic importance  combining high renewal rates with sustained traction in managed and cloud-based offerings. The line continues to evolve toward greater automation  observability  and scalability  positioning Axway as a key enabler of secure data exchange in complex enterprise environments.

The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 38 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document.4 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 39 and 748 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).5 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on pages 39 and 40 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 40 of Societe Generale’s 2025 Universal Registration Document. Starting from Q1 25 results  with restated historical data  normative return to businesses is based on a 13% capital allocation. The Q1 25 allocated capital includes the regulatory impacts related to Basel IV  applicable since 1 January 2025.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is the accounting Group net income adjusted for “Interest paid and payable to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisation”.

The solvency ratios and leverage ratio are presented on a pro-forma basis for the current year’s accrued results  net of dividends  unless otherwise stated.9- Funded balance sheet  loan to deposit ratioThe funded balance sheet is based on the Group financial statements. It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications: Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities. Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); exclude financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines). Wholesale funding: includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued. Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year. Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing). Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the ratio of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with around 119 000 employees serving more than 26 million clients in 62 countries across the world.
