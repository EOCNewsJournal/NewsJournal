With the current US administration reluctant to approve further large-scale assistance  the European Union and United Kingdom would need to contribute an estimated $328 billion and $61 billion respectively.Belgium – home to the Euroclear clearinghouse that holds the majority of the frozen Russian funds – has opposed the idea  warning that it amounts to “sort-of-confiscation” and exposes it to immense legal and financial risks it wants nations to share. Moscow has condemned the plan as outright theft and promised retaliation.The plan “will happen  Belgian resistance or not  because it is the only game in town to fund Ukraine in the coming year or two ” The Economist reported. It added Brussels will subsequently need to overcome internal opposition from dissenting member states such as Hungary to finance Kiev directly from the EU budget.Moscow has said its objective remains a neutral and demilitarized Ukraine that guarantees the rights of its ethnic Russian population. Russian officials describe the conflict as a NATO-driven proxy war stemming from the bloc’s eastward expansion.,neutral,0.01,0.64,0.35,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Former Soviet Union', 'RT Russia', 'assets', 'Economist', 'controversial “reparation loan” plan', 'direct US support', 'current US administration', 'dissenting member states', 'Western financial support', 'ethnic Russian population', 'NATO-driven proxy war', 'next four years', 'Western European backers', 'European NATO states', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'European Union', 'war chest', 'sovereign wealth', 'Russian funds', 'financial risks', 'Russian officials', 'The Economist', 'budget shortfall', 'foreign sponsors', 'large-scale assistance', 'United Kingdom', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'immense legal', 'outright theft', 'Belgian resistance', 'coming year', 'internal opposition', 'eastward expansion', 'British outlet', 'EU budget', 'demilitarized Ukraine', 'Kiev', 'option', 'conflict', 'cash', 'burden', 'magazine', 'Thursday', 'funding', 'cohesion', 'alternative', 'collateral', 'projections', 'Belgium', 'majority', 'idea', 'confiscation', 'nations', 'Moscow', 'retaliation', 'game', 'town', 'Brussels', 'Hungary', 'objective', 'neutral', 'rights', 'bloc']",2025-10-31,2025-11-01,rt.com
53486,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,http://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/31/economics-europe-eu-ukraine-diplomacy/,Economics Is Europe’s Tool for Everything,Why the bloc always seeks economic solutions to its political problems.,Last week at a European Union summit  Belgium fought a plan supported by a majority of member states to use 140 billion euros in frozen Russian assets—held at Euroclear in Brussels—as the basis for a reparation loan for Ukraine. To the frustration of many  Belgium held out  on the grounds that as the host country of the funds it faced legal uncertainty and financial liability. This forced European heads of state and government to postpone a decision until at least December.Belgium does not often find itself in a position of resisting European legislation  whatever the subject. But that’s exactly what it’s doing now.Last week at a European Union summit  Belgium fought a plan supported by a majority of member states to use 140 billion euros in frozen Russian assets—held at Euroclear in Brussels—as the basis for a reparation loan for Ukraine. To the frustration of many  Belgium held out  on the grounds that as the host country of the funds it faced legal uncertainty and financial liability. This forced European heads of state and government to postpone a decision until at least December.Some other countries and the European Central Bank sympathize with these arguments. Belgium does not entirely stand alone. Still  this looks like a lost battle. European officials are committed to drafting a compromise proposal. Many diplomats and officials think that sooner rather than later  a deal will be clinched on this delicate matter. Why? Because Europe desperately needs money for Ukraine. And  more fundamentally  this is Europe’s only tried-and-true method for achieving big goals. In all the challenges and crises it has experienced since World War II  it has always prioritized finding an economic path to achieve political progress.The economy is the one field in which EU member states are most willing to pool their sovereignty. Only if all economic routes are exhausted will they ever consider more political integration. Russia’s war in Ukraine  the outcome of which is of existential importance to Europe  is no different. As always  for Europe  it’s the economy  stupid.The fact that the EU will keep working on a way to make the most of the Russian assets (the interest on those assets has already been used for Ukraine) was not the only proof of that last week. At the summit in Brussels  national leaders also adopted a 19th package of economic sanctions against Russia. The package targets “22 persons and 42 entities responsible for actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of Ukraine ” including the rector of a Moscow university that offers a two-year master’s program on how to circumvent Western sanctions. Moreover  the leaders agreed on measures to target Russia’s shadow fleet in the Baltic Sea  hoping that increased EU cooperation with the flag states of those ships (such as the Comoros) can force them to finally comply with European environmental and maritime safety standards—which today they do not.For Europe  the war in Ukraine is all about security—its own security. For many years  most Europeans did not fear Russian President Vladimir Putin because they felt protected by the United States through NATO. They felt sorry for the Chechens  Georgians  and Ukrainians suffering Putin’s murderous attacks  but they never felt their own security endangered. They assumed that Putin would not target a European country because that would risk a clash with NATO  the world’s mightiest military alliance. This certainty  however  was shattered when Donald Trump became U.S. president again in January.Trump is ambiguous at best about U.S. security guarantees to Europe. And so  Europeans now fear Putin. They realize that if Ukraine falls  Russia will be at their doorstep. Millions of Ukrainians could then be deployed to conquer the Baltic states  which Putin also considers Russian  just as Ukrainians in the occupied Donbas are today being forced by Russia to fight against their own people.So  if Europe wants to keep Putin and war at bay  it must ensure that Ukraine does not lose. For 80 years  the United States was Europe’s security guarantee. Now it is Ukraine. This is a fundamental shift  which poses fundamental challenges to a continent that has neglected its defense for decades and is not ready to face war.When priorities change  choices do too. Some now say Europe will have to build its own European army. Others hope—or fear—that a European defense union will see the light soon  paired with a European security council and a powerful European foreign and security policy without the strict unanimity requirement currently weakening Europe’s resolve in the international arena. If there were ever a time to take these steps  they argue  it is now. Yet that is not very likely to happen soon. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine  and especially under Trump’s second presidency  the main steps taken by European countries have been economic in character  not political.Examples of this are deploying sanctions against Russia  which hit Moscow harder than U.S. sanctions because Europe traded more with Russia; slowly weaning Europe from Russian oil and gas; jointly purchasing weapons and ammunition for Ukraine; for NATO countries  investing 5 percent of GDP in Europe’s defense and security  in exchange for some U.S. political goodwill; gradually  sector by sector  integrating Ukraine into the EU’s internal market (including the electricity market and the roaming scheme  just to mention two examples); using interest on the frozen Russian assets at Euroclear for Ukraine; and investing in the European arms industry  coordinated and possibly soon co-financed by the European Commission to the tune of 800 billion euros (about $841 billion). In short  the main problem in Europe is security  but these are all economic solutions.Does this sound strange? Well  it has always been this way. Since the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up in 1952—when Belgium  France  West Germany  Italy  Luxembourg  and the Netherlands agreed to place their war industries under a higher authority so they could no longer wage war against one another—peace and security have been pursued with economic means. French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman  who proposed the ECSC in 1950  understood that European governments were less resistant to economic solutions than to solutions of a political nature  which lie at the heart of national sovereignty.In an essay in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in April  Kiran Klaus Patel  a professor of European history at LMU Munich  pointed out that this “Schuman method” worked well in 1952. It worked again after the fall of the Berlin Wall  when the EU single market was completed. Today  it is working once more.Sometimes  it happens against all the odds. For example  the ECSC quickly became dysfunctional due to a coal crisis. But the institution did not die. It rolled over into a partnership with the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community and found a role in industrial policy and later agriculture. More top-down political integration was often less successful. The European Defense Community (which included a real European army) was rejected by the French National Assembly in 1954. The Council of Europe  which focuses on human rights  has languished over the years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989  something similar happened: Political integration under the Maastricht Treaty got off to a slow start because some governments did not want a strong “social Europe” or a strong Schengen. By contrast  Patel noted  the euro and the single market flourished. They became “the ventricles of the system: A stable currency made trade easier  and both the euro and the single market created new prosperity.”The Schuman method also worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a major crisis  affecting all of Europe  threatening to devastate the single market through border closures and national export restrictions. Public health in Europe  however  is a purely national competence. EU member states did not want “Europeanize” this. So they tackled the crisis by economic means: joint vaccine purchases and a scheme of temporary joint debt issuance to prop up economies of affected countries. It worked  again. And health policy is still as national as it was before the pandemic.Today again  Europe seems to be reviving the Schuman plan. With the war in Ukraine becoming Europe’s war  national governments are forced to find a common solution. True to form  they do not choose far-reaching political integration: There is no move toward majority voting in foreign policy and security matters  to sending troops to Ukraine or the institutional reforms required for the EU to be able to absorb new member states. No  they throw money at it. European Council President António Costa alluded to this last Thursday: “Europe’s defense is not just about spending more. It’s about spending smarter  working together and delivering for our citizens. This is how we build Europe’s sovereignty.”Of course  by spending together  European countries tie themselves together politically—by tying their fates together and sharing responsibility. This is  in part  the point that Belgium is trying to emphasize in the battle over Russia’s assets at Euroclear. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever sees both legal and financial risks if assets of a sovereign state that should be safe in the EU’s rule of law can simply be seized. Confidence in Europe’s legal and financial systems could be undermined. Will investors start avoiding Europe  and Belgium in particular  because something similar could happen to others? And if something goes wrong  will Belgian taxpayers then have to foot the bill? That  he said  would be “completely insane.”Still  for now  the debate is mostly about spending  and once again European countries are using the economy as a driver of integration. If Europe is level-headed and pragmatic in this regard  Patel argued in his article  things could turn out well. A political approach will only meet with resistance from EU capitals. In his view  the step-by-step  economic approach has always worked better. “In the past  many political systems have stumbled because they raised very high expectations and then everyone got disappointed ” Patel wrote. “The EU would do well to avoid this danger.”,neutral,0.22,0.77,0.0,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['Economics', 'Europe', 'Tool', 'Everything', 'U.S. security guarantees', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'U.S. president', 'maritime safety standards', 'mightiest military alliance', 'strict unanimity requirement', 'U.S. sanctions', 'European Central Bank', 'powerful European foreign', 'European Union summit', 'European defense union', 'European security council', 'EU member states', 'World War II', 'European heads', 'European legislation', 'European environmental', 'European country', 'European army', 'European countries', 'Russian invasion', 'Russian assets', 'flag states', 'United States', 'Baltic states', '140 billion euros', 'reparation loan', 'host country', 'legal uncertainty', 'financial liability', 'other countries', 'compromise proposal', 'Many diplomats', 'delicate matter', 'true method', 'big goals', 'economic path', 'political progress', 'one field', 'economic routes', 'political integration', 'existential importance', 'last week', 'economic sanctions', 'territorial integrity', 'two-year master', 'Western sanctions', 'shadow fleet', 'Baltic Sea', 'EU cooperation', 'murderous attacks', 'fundamental shift', 'security policy', 'international arena', 'second presidency', 'European officials', 'national leaders', '19th package', 'Moscow university', 'many years', 'most Europeans', 'fundamental challenges', 'main steps', 'Donald Trump', '80 years', 'Belgium', 'plan', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'basis', 'Ukraine', 'frustration', 'grounds', 'funds', 'government', 'decision', 'December', 'position', 'subject', 'arguments', 'battle', 'deal', 'money', 'crises', 'economy', 'sovereignty', 'outcome', 'fact', 'way', 'interest', 'proof', '22 persons', '42 entities', 'actions', 'independence', 'rector', 'program', 'measures', 'ships', 'Comoros', 'NATO', 'Chechens', 'Georgians', 'Ukrainians', 'clash', 'January', 'doorstep', 'Millions', 'occupied', 'Donbas', 'people', 'bay', 'continent', 'decades', 'priorities', 'choices', 'Others', 'light', 'resolve', 'character', 'Examples']",2025-10-31,2025-11-01,foreignpolicy.com

Oct. 31  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with ca…,$71 million in funding would extend Nanobiotix cash visibility into early 2028Transaction enables Nanobiotix development beyond key milestones in head and neck cancer and lung cancerFinancing establishes financial foundation toward self-sustainability and the advancement of next wave nanotherapeutic platforms for long-term growthHealthCare Royalty (HCRx) will receive a capped portion of milestones and royalties on sales of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) payable to Nanobiotix under its global licensing agreementPARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Oct. 31  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced that it has entered into a royalty-based financing agreement with HealthCare Royalty (“HCRx”)  providing up to $71 million in non-dilutive capital and establishing the financial foundation for self-sustainability and the advancement of next wave nanotherapeutic platforms for long-term growth.“This non-dilutive financing reflects our commitment to preserving long-term shareholder value  while strategically aligning capital to unlock the full potential of our nanotherapeutics platforms. Importantly  this funding provides the resources to advance the company through critical potential milestones that will lead to self-sustainability and durable value creation ” said Bart van Rhijn  Chief Financial and Business Officer at Nanobiotix.Key Terms of the Royalty Financing AgreementAt the closing of the agreement  Nanobiotix will receive an upfront payment of $50 million and expects to receive an additional $21 million one year post closing subject to reaching certain conditionsAssuming $71 million is funded  success-based 1 remuneration to HCRx includes: Repayment from a defined portion of royalties on the first $1 billion of net sales and a portion of certain regulatory and commercial milestone payments  subject to a cap of approximately $124 million (1.75x Multiple on Invested Capital (“MOIC”)) if repayment is completed by end of 2030  increasing to approximately $178 million (2.50x MOIC) if repayment occurs thereafter (the Return Cap figures assume $71 million is funded) Following achievement of the Return Cap  a royalty-only tail period will commence  which entitles HCRx to a predefined  reduced share of royalties not to exceed $14.9 million per year; the tail period will expire 10 years following the first commercial sale of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in the USremuneration to HCRx includes: Payment and repayment obligations under both this royalty financing agreement with HCRx and the existing royalty agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) will be furnished through the transfer of receivables from the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) license agreement to a French law trust“We are excited to partner with Nanobiotix at this pivotal stage of its growth” said Clarke Futch  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at HCRx. “The differentiated nature of their physics-based approach and the compelling clinical profile of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) align with our mission of supporting innovative therapies that address areas of significant unmet need. This investment underscores our confidence in this first-of-its-kind approach to cancer treatment  which has the potential to redefine standards of care and establish an entirely new class of therapy.”TD Cowen acted as sole financial advisor to Nanobiotix.Assuming the drawdown of the second tranche one year post closing  this financing extends Nanobiotix cash runway into early 2028 subject to closing of the agreement. This extension of cash runway does not include potential milestone payments from the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) licensing agreement. The Company continues to expect to receive the first potential milestone payments related to clinical development in head and neck cancer (NANORAY-312) and lung cancer (CONVERGE) within this timeframe  and has thereby established the financial foundation for self-sustaining long-term growth.About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The agency will now initiate the final phase in its regulatory review  allowing stakeholders such as growers and industry associations 15 days to provide feedback before finalizing its regulatory decision.The EPA has also posted a final rule exempting EVOCA’s active ingredient residues on treated crops from tolerance requirements  indicating that no maximum residue limits will apply and highlighting the product candidate’s exemplary safety profile.EVOCA is a precision biocontrol solution that targets the fungal pathogens botrytis (grey mold) and powdery mildew in high-value fruits and vegetables without harming beneficial organisms or the environment. The product candidate offers growers a new mode of action to manage resistance to existing fungicides as was recognised by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC)**  a panel of renown industry experts.“The EPA’s recommendation to approve EVOCA marks a pivotal moment for Biotalys  and the advancement of the first protein-based biofungicide of its kind for approval in the United States. This achievement underscores Biotalys’ pioneering leadership in agricultural innovation and provides the company with a significant first-mover advantage in transforming how growers protect their crops safely and sustainably.” said Kevin Helash  CEO of Biotalys.“Our protein-based platform has the potential to transform crop protection by delivering next generation biological solutions with new modes of action  developed to create targeted  consistent and scalable products to meet farmers’ needs  as demonstrated today by the EPA’s publication ” he added.“This significant milestone reflects the dedication and expertise of the entire Biotalys team ” Helash concluded. “EVOCA is just the beginning for Biotalys  and we look forward to bringing our pipeline of fungicides and insecticides to the market in the coming years.”An approval of EVOCA paves the way for the regulatory submission of EVOCA NG  the next-generation version of the product candidate  and Biotalys’ anticipated first commercial launch. The company expects the review process for EVOCA NG to be significantly shorter as the product contains the same active ingredient as EVOCA and features enhanced formulation and production methods.To read the full EPA documents please visit:https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OPP-2021-0165https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-19712/pesticide-tolerance-exemptions-petitions-revocations-etc-asfbiof01-02-polypeptide* EVOCA™: Pending regulatory review.

Tolling sales were affected both by intensified competition in Europe and by persistently low inventory levels among metal distributors  against a backdrop of sluggish demand and ongoing volatility in LME prices. Packaged sales also declined  impacted by the economic slowdown and a high comparison base in 2024. No licensing revenue was recognised during the period under the strategic agreement in China.This contraction in business  combined with the absence of licensing revenue  had a significant impact on profitability and cash flow. In response  the Company has implemented a comprehensive financial recovery plan based on three key priorities:Cost optimisation: reducing raw material inventories  adjusting capital expenditure  and aligning staffing levels - including economic unemployment measures in Belgium and layoffs in Germany. These initiatives are expected to deliver their full effect from the second half of 2025.Commercial recovery: intensifying actions targeting strategic customers and exploring high-potential markets  particularly in Asia  the Middle East and India  where demand for anodised aluminium remains strong.Continuation of the licensing agreement in China: implementation is progressing according to the roadmap  based on knowledge transfer and local industrial integration. The production line is now nearly completed and is expected to begin its first testing phase  which will trigger the next milestone payment. However  at this stage  the Company cannot confirm that this step will occur before the end of fiscal year 2025.To support this plan and strengthen its financial structure  COIL completed a reserved capital increase of €1.3 million in early October  subscribed in cash by private investors and members of management1. The funds raised will be used to cover current operating expenses and meet short-term financial commitments.ResultsIn line with the second half of 2024  the first-half 2025 results show a sharp deterioration in profitability  driven by lower tolling activities and the absence of royalties.EBITDA2 came to €(2.3) million  compared with a profit of €2.0 million a year earlier. This change reflects the decline in gross margin  partially offset by tight control of operating expenses  which include a €0.4 million provision related to the repayment of a subsidy received in 2023 in Germany.After a €0.2 million reduction in depreciation  amortisation and provisions  operating income stood at €(3.4) million  down €4.2 million year-on-year.Net income reached €(3.6) million  compared with a profit of €0.5 million  including €0.1 million in net financial expenses.Simplified income statement(€M) 2025 H1(6 months) 2024 H1(6 months) Change 2024(12 months) Sales and license revenues 8.6 13.1 -34.3% 24.1 Tolling sales 6.9 9.2 -24.6% 17.4 Package sales3 1.7 1.9 -12.6% 4.7 Licensing & Royalties - 2.0 n.a. 2.0 EBITDA (2.3) 2.0 -€4.4m 0.3 % of sales and revenues (26.9)% 15.5% 1.1% Income from ordinary operations 0.7 0.7 -€4.2m (2.2) % of sales and revenues 5.7% 5.7% (9.3)% Operating profit (3.4) 0.7 -€4.2m (2.8) % of sales and revenues (39.6)% 5.7% (11.6)% Income before tax (3.6) 0.6 -€4.2m (3.0) Net income (3.6) 0.5 -€4.0m (3.2) % of sales and revenues (41.2)% 3.4% (13.1)%Balance SheetAt 30 June 2025  shareholders’ equity was €14.7 million  down €3.6 million compared to 31 December 2024. Net financial debt was €4.4 million  down €0.2 million over six months and representing 30.3% of equity  compared with 25.3% at year-end 2024. It included cash and cash equivalents of €0.3 million  compared to €0.5 million at 31 December 2024.The Company notes that it remains subject to banking covenants. In view of the decline in results in 2023 and 2024  the Net Debt / EBITDA ratio (< 2.00) was not met as of 31 December 2024 for two Belgian banks. Temporary waivers were granted - one in consideration of exceptional circumstances  and the other as part of a new financing agreement in the form of a €1 million straight loan to be repaid between September 2025 and the end of 2026.According to the Company’s estimates  the capital increase completed in October is sufficient to ensure the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Post-closing eventsTo support its recovery  on October 3  2025  the Company announced the completion of a reserved capital increase totalling €1.3 million  subscribed in cash by private investors and several members of the management team. This transaction aims to strengthen the Company’s equity and support the implementation of its recovery plan. It helps secure business continuity by improving short-term cash visibility  while stabilising the shareholder structure around long-term supportive reference investors.In the same spirit  at its meetings on 16 and 23 October 2025  the Board of Directors decided to terminate for just cause the contract with Finance & Management International (FMI)  represented by Timothy Hutton  which had previously been responsible for the Company’s executive management. At the same time  the Board appointed Jean Schroyen (representing SIMAC Solutions BV) and Jan Robeyns (representing J2Fix BV) as delegates for day-to-day operations.With more than forty years of combined experience within COIL and in the aluminium anodising sector  they combine strategic vision  technical expertise  and operational leadership to drive the implementation of the recovery plan and support the Company’s transformation.2024 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2025 came to €5.3 million  up slightly by +1.0% year-on-year. The moderate decrease in tolling sales (€4.3 million; -2.3%) was offset by an increase in packaged sales (€1.0 million; +17.3%). No licensing revenue was received in China during this quarter.For the first nine months of the year  sales and license revenues totalled €13.9 million  down -24.2% compared with the same period in 2024. Tolling sales fell by -17.4% to €11.2 million  while packaged offer sales decreased by -3.3% to €2.7 million. No licensing revenue was recognised under the Chinese collaboration agreement during the period  versus €2.0 million in 2024.OutlookIn a persistently uncertain economic environment  particularly in Europe  COIL expects a decline in revenue and earnings for the full year 2025. In response to these challenging conditions  the Company continues to adapt its business model around three strategic levers:cost optimisation  to strengthen operational efficiency;industrial agility  to align production with market dynamics;enhancement of its technological expertise  to better serve strategic customers and capture new growth opportunities in emerging markets.Supported by its distinctive technologies  its commitment to responsible production  and the dedication of its teams  COIL approaches this transition period with determination  aiming to turn current challenges into opportunities for sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving market.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 30 October 2025 and are included in the 2025 half-year financial report available on the Company's financial website: http://investors.coil.beAgendaPublication of 2025 annual sales figures: 29 January 2026 after the close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has more than 100 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a business volume of €24 1 million in 2024.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILJean Schroyen / Jan Robeynsinvestor.relations@coil.beTel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 ACTUS FINANCE & COMMUNICATIONCyril Combeccombe@actus.frTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 361 See press release dated October 3  2025: http://pdf.coil.be/press_room/20251003_PR_EN.pdf2 EBIT before depreciation  amortization and provisions (net of reversals).3 Anodising and metal included.Attachment,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.29,0.15,0.56,True,English,"['CHALLENGING FIRST HALF', 'RECOVERY PLAN UNDERWAY', 'COIL', 'Net Debt / EBITDA ratio', 'cautious global economic climate', 'comprehensive financial recovery plan', 'Net financial debt', 'high comparison base', 'raw material inventories', 'economic unemployment measures', 'local industrial integration', 'next milestone payment', 'two Belgian banks', 'short-term financial commitments', 'low inventory levels', 'three key priorities', 'first testing phase', 'lower tolling activities', 'net financial expenses', 'new financing agreement', '€1 million straight loan', 'weak end-market demand', 'current operating expenses', 'RECOVERY PLAN UNDERWAY', 'Simplified income statement', 'CHALLENGING FIRST HALF', 'economic slowdown', 'financial structure', 'Net income', '2025 financial year', 'Key highlights', 'staffing levels', 'Commercial recovery', 'strategic agreement', '€0.4 million provision', '€0.2 million reduction', 'second half', 'licensing agreement', 'operating income', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'World leader', 'metal distributors', 'sluggish demand', 'ongoing volatility', 'LME prices', 'significant impact', 'Cost optimisation', 'capital expenditure', 'full effect', 'strategic customers', 'high-potential markets', 'Middle East', 'knowledge transfer', 'capital increase', 'private investors', 'sharp deterioration', 'gross margin', 'tight control', '4 Package sales3', 'ordinary operations', 'Balance Sheet', 'six months', 'banking covenants', 'Temporary waivers', 'exceptional circumstances', 'going concern', 'Post-closing events', 'Tolling sales', 'licensing revenue', 'aluminium anodising', 'fiscal year', 'Operating profit', 'production line', 'several members', 'management team', 'cash flow', 'cash equivalents', 'significant decline', 'shareholders’ equity', 'Packaged sales', 'early October', 'first-half 2025 results', 'license revenues', 'The Company', '31 October', 'Brussels', 'COIL', 'context', 'activity', 'intensified', 'competition', 'Europe', 'backdrop', 'period', 'China', 'contraction', 'business', 'absence', 'profitability', 'response', 'Belgium', 'layoffs', 'Germany', 'initiatives', 'actions', 'Asia', 'India', 'anodised', 'Continuation', 'implementation', 'roadmap', 'stage', 'step', 'funds', 'royalties', 'EBITDA2', 'change', 'repayment', 'subsidy', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'provisions', 'H1', 'tax', '30 June', '31 December', 'year-end', 'view', 'consideration', 'part', 'form', 'September', 'estimates', 'completion', 'transaction', '2.0']",2025-10-31,2025-11-01,globenewswire.com

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenue for the first nine months of 2025.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GTT  said: “The commercial performance of our core business remained robust during the first nine months of 2025  despite persistent geopolitical uncertainty. In the United States  the lifting of the moratorium on new LNG projects has spectacularly reignited investment decisions. Ten new liquefaction projects have been approved  including six in the United States  for a record capacity of 84 Mtpa. This momentum is driving a very significant increase in the need for new LNG carriers.In the digital field  the acquisition of the Danish company Danelec  completed on 31 July 2025  positions GTT as a global leader in vessel performance management and Voyage Data Recorders. This transaction creates a new growth pillar for the Group  with strong complementarity with Ascenz Marorka and synergies  mainly through significant cross-sales expected in the medium term.GTT’s innovation efforts continue. In September 2025  we launched GTT CubiqTM  a new LNG tank technology providing a concrete response to container-ship owner’s needs.On the financial front  our revenue rose 29% over nine months  driven by the increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Given the strong performance of GTT’s core business and the contribution from Danelec  we are raising our 2025 objectives.”Business activity over the first nine months of 2025- LNG and ethane carriers: Commercial performance remains solidFollowing a 2024 that marked the second record year in terms of order intake  and in an uncertain geopolitical environment  GTT achieved a solid commercial performance in its core business over the first nine months of 2025  with 19 LNG carrier orders and seven Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC) orders. This momentum confirms the resilience of global demand for LNG transport  supported by massive investment decisions in new liquefaction projects.Notably  among these 19 LNG carrier orders  six are for ultra-large vessels (271 000 m³ compared with the standard 174 000 m³)  placed with the Chinese shipyard Hudong-Zhonghua. These vessels will be fitted with GTT’s NO96 Super+ membrane containment system. Deliveries are scheduled between 2027 and 2031.The seven VLECs ordered will each offer a total capacity of 100 000 m³  the largest to date for this type of vessel  and will feature GTT’s Mark III membrane containment system. Delivery of these ethane carriers will take place in 2027 and 2028  confirming the growing strength of the ethane market  driven by the expansion of global petrochemicals.Over the period  GTT also received an order for one FLNG1 with a total capacity of 238 700 m³. Ordered by Samsung Heavy Industries  this FLNG will be deployed in Africa.- LNG as fuel: Growth in the LNG-powered container ship marketThe LNG as fuel market continues to develop in a context of intensifying competition from Chinese shipyards. In the first nine months of 2025  GTT recorded an order from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for the design of cryogenic tanks (12 750 m³) for 12 new container ships  as well as an order from HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering for the design of cryogenic tanks (8 000 m³) for six new container ships. All of these LNG tanks will be fitted with GTT’s Mark III Flex membrane containment system  together with the “1 barg”2 design  which enables an operating pressure of 1 barg  compared to 0.7 barg previously. This technical innovation addresses forthcoming regulations requiring cold ironing at the quayside  confirming its added value for the maritime industry.In the third quarter of 2025  GTT also received an order from Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. for the design of tanks for an LNG bunker vessel with a total capacity of 18 600 m³  scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2028.- Digital: Strong commercial momentum and a change of scale with DanelecGTT’s digital business experienced a marked acceleration over the first nine months of 2025. Several commercial successes confirmed the added value of the Group’s solutions. The TMS group selected Ascenz Marorka to equip its entire fleet of more than 130 vessels (oil tankers  bulk carriers  liquefied gas carriers and container ships) with its Smart Shipping solutions.China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) also chose Ascenz Marorka to equip eight LNG carriers with a complete suite of onboard systems.In addition  Ascenz Marorka extended its geographic reach with the opening of a new real-time fleet performance monitoring centre.Finally  a decisive milestone was reached with the completion  on 31 July 2025  of the acquisition of Danelec  a major player in the collection and analysis of maritime data. Thanks to this transaction  GTT has become the global leader in vessel performance management and has joined the top tier of players in the critical Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) segment  now covering 15%3 of the global fleet. The integration of Danelec began rapidly and paves the way for accelerated growth driven by cross-sales  expected to reach between 25 and 30 million euros in 2030  thanks to the strong complementarity of the offerings of Danelec  Ascenz Marorka and VPS.- Elogen: Completion of the restructuringFollowing the strategic review of Elogen’s activities carried out at the beginning of the year  the information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies were completed in July 2025. A workforce reduction plan  involving the elimination of 110 positions out of 160  has been implemented and will be finalised before the end of the year  mainly through voluntary departures. In parallel  the construction of the Gigafactory in Vendôme has been definitively halted. All provisions related to the restructuring were recorded in the first half of 2025.The signing of a contract for the supply of a 1 MW stack and the partnership agreement with Rockfin to ramp up the rollout of hydrogen production systems in Europe are encouraging signals for Elogen’s future activity.- Innovation: continuous development of new technologiesInnovation remains at the heart of GTT’s strategy  with several major advances recorded over the first nine months of 2025. The approvals recently granted by classification society reflect the international recognition of our solutions. At the Gastech exhibition in Milan in September 2025  GTT obtained an AiP4 from Bureau Veritas for its new GTT Cubiq™ tank technology for container ships. At the same occasion  GTT also received from Lloyd’s Register a second AiP for its optimized containment systems for ethane transportation as well as a General Approval5 for an improved version of the NO96 Super+ technology  confirming the Group’s ability to continuously evolve its containment systems.Finally  GTT announced a strategic partnership with BLOOM ENERGY and PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP to develop an innovative integrated energy system designed for sustainable vessel propulsion.- GTT Strategic Ventures: New investments to accelerate the maritime energy transitionSince the beginning of the year  the GTT Strategic Ventures investment fund has strengthened its portfolio with two new minority stakes:In April 2025  GTT Strategic Ventures invested in novoMOF  a company specialising in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)  compact and high-performance materials for CO₂ capture  particularly well-suited to maritime transportation.In July 2025  it invested in CorPower Ocean  whose wave energy technology harnesses the power of the sea with resilience and efficiency  offering stable and competitive electricity generation among renewable marine energiesOrder book as of 30 September 2025As of 1 January 2025  GTT’s order book  excluding LNG as fuel  comprised 332 units.
