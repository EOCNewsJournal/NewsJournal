According to von der Leyen  Ukraine will only repay the loan if Russia pays ""reparations."" However  there is no consensus on this loan in the European Union. In October  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that the EU's ideas about Russia paying reparations to the Ukrainian side were detached from reality  and Brussels had long been engaged in stealing Russian assets. She also stated that Moscow would give a guaranteed and very painful response in the event of the confiscation of its frozen assets.After the start of the Russian special operation in Ukraine  the EU and the G7 countries froze almost half of Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves  amounting to approximately 300 billion euros. Of these  more than 200 billion euros are located in the EU  mainly in the accounts of the Belgium's Euroclear  one of the world's largest settlement and clearing systems. The European Commission reported that the EU had transferred 14 billion euros to Ukraine from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets between January and September 2025.In response to the asset freeze  Russia introduced its own restrictions: the assets of foreign investors from unfriendly countries and the income from them are accumulated in special ""C"" type accounts. They can only be withdrawn by a decision of a special government commission.The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called the freezing of Russian assets in Europe theft  noting that the EU is targeting not only the funds of private individuals  but also the state assets of Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow would respond to the confiscation of frozen Russian assets by the West. According to Lavrov  Russia also has the opportunity not to return the funds that Western countries held in Russia.ukraineserbiarussiaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussian foreign ministry  european union (eu)  ukraine  serbia  russia  sergey lavrov  aleksandar vulin  ursula von der leyen  european commission",negative,0.01,0.24,0.76,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'Proper Response', 'EU', 'Serbia', 'Vulin', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'russian foreign ministry european union', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'special ""C"" type accounts', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'Russian special operation', 'special government commission', 'leyen european commission', 'The European Commission', 'frozen Russian assets', 'foreign investors', 'ukraine serbia russia', 'frozen assets', 'Sputnik International', 'Ukrainian side', 'G7 countries', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'largest settlement', 'clearing systems', '14 billion euros', 'asset freeze', 'unfriendly countries', 'private individuals', 'state assets', 'Western countries', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'Proper Response', 'adequate response', 'painful response', 'Aleksandar Vulin', 'new loan', 'sputnikglobe', 'russian-assets', 'serbias', 'founder', 'Movement', 'Socialists', 'world', 'cdn', 'September', 'reparations', 'consensus', 'October', 'ideas', 'reality', 'Brussels', 'Moscow', 'guaranteed', 'event', 'confiscation', 'start', 'half', 'gold', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'proceeds', 'January', 'restrictions', 'income', 'decision', 'freezing', 'funds', 'opportunity', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-11-02,2025-11-03,sputnikglobe.com
