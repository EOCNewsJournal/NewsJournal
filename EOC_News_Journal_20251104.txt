Kiev requested an additional $8 billion last month  but talks have reportedly stalled over doubts about its economic viability.The EU  Ukraine’s main sponsor  last month failed to approve a €140 billion ($160 billion) “reparations loan” backed by frozen Russian assets after Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever opposed it  calling it “sort-of-confiscation” and warning it exposes Belgium to major legal and financial risks without shared liability from other EU states.Sources told Politico that the IMF may not grant further funding to Ukraine  vital for its war effort amid a deep budget shortfall  unless the EU approves the new loan.They explained that the “reparations loan” would reassure the IMF of Ukraine’s fiscal resilience – a key condition for any funding. Though relatively small  the IMF program’s approval would in turn signal to investors that Ukraine remains solvent  they added.Western nations froze about $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets in 2022  including €200 billion ($209 billion) held at the Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The G7 last year backed using interest from those funds to secure $50 billion in loans for Ukraine.This year  EU finance ministers proposed a similar “reparations loan ” to be repaid if Kiev receives compensation from Moscow after the conflict ends. Following Belgium’s refusal to support the plan – and amid wider concerns over legal and fiscal risks – reports claimed EU states could instead issue joint bonds to aid Kiev or cut funding for Ukraine entirely. A final decision is expected at the European Commission summit in December.Moscow has condemned Western plans to redirect its frozen funds as outright “theft ” warning that the move would undermine trust in Western financial systems. It has also maintained that Western aid to Kiev only prolongs the conflict without affecting its outcome.,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,negative,0.0,0.35,0.64,True,English,"['EU officials', 'IMF', 'plug', 'Ukraine', 'Politico', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'new IMF funding package', 'deep budget shortfall', 'European Commission summit', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'EU finance ministers', 'Western financial systems', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'other EU states', 'similar “reparations loan', 'Russian assets', 'new loan', 'financial risks', 'Western aid', 'Western nations', 'Western plans', 'EU officials', 'cascading loss', 'economic viability', 'significant resistance', '$15.5 billion program', 'The EU', 'main sponsor', 'war effort', 'fiscal resilience', 'key condition', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse', 'The G7', 'wider concerns', 'fiscal risks', 'joint bonds', 'final decision', 'IMF program', 'legal risks', 'major legal', 'conflict ends', 'IMF loans', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'refusal', 'Ukraine', 'confidence', 'country', 'Politico', 'sources', 'collateral', 'order', 'outlet', 'Monday', 'talks', 'doubts', 'confiscation', 'liability', 'approval', 'turn', 'investors', 'Euroclear', 'interest', 'compensation', 'Moscow', 'reports', 'December', 'move', 'trust', 'outcome']",2025-11-03,2025-11-04,rt.com

It represents a defining step toward a unified token economy - one where every creator  protocol and community can build across chains without boundaries.Build Once - Launch EverywhereThe debut of XSwap’s Token Creation Platform (TCP) marks a turning point for Web3 builders.It combines Chainlink’s proven infrastructure with Base’s high-performance Layer-2 to deliver instant token issuance on Base with CCIP-powered interoperability for seamless expansion to additional chains. Now  creators can create tokens across multiple chains in seconds using a no-code platform built for speed  accessibility and true interoperability.Until now  token launches have been fragmented and limited to isolated ecosystems.XSwap changes that by enabling tokens to be minted natively on Base and seamlessly connected to other networks through Chainlink’s CCIP  establishing a foundation for multi-chain liquidity and growth.Bringing the Next Generation of Token Creation to a Secure  Interoperable FoundationOver the past year  token creation platforms have collectively generated billions of dollars in market value and daily trading volumes reaching the billion-dollar scale  underscoring a clear shift: onchain token creation has become one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain economy.Yet  this growth has been limited by fragmentation across isolated ecosystems.XSwap’s Token Creation Platform (TCP) brings this momentum into a secure  scalable  and interoperable framework powered by Chainlink CCIP. By merging ease of use with trusted infrastructure  XSwap positions itself at the forefront of a new era of builder-driven onchain creation.“Our goal was to make token creation feel simple and intuitive ” said CJ  CEO of XSwap. “With TCP  builders can launch and connect their tokens in minutes without needing to think about the technical details. We’re giving them tools that just work  so they can focus on building projects that matter.”Each token created through TCP is deployed by default on Base  providing a scalable  cost-efficient environment that can be later expanded seamlessly to other blockchains through Chainlink CCIP.Powered by Chainlink’s battle-tested CCIP infrastructure  XSwap enables secure token transfers across ecosystems while removing technical barriers for new creators. Its intuitive interface allows anyone to configure and deploy a cross-chain token without writing a single line of code - reducing entry friction for both independent developers and organizations looking to launch onchain assets.“By leveraging Chainlink CCIP  XSwap is giving builders secure and reliable access to cross-chain functionality from day one ” said Sam Friedman  Principal Solutions Architect at Chainlink Labs. “This collaboration proves how Chainlink’s interoperability standard simplifies complex cross-chain workflows to unlock new use cases that bring more users and projects onchain.”Supporting Real BuildersXSwap includes a creator recognition program designed to celebrate meaningful builder progress. Each project launched through the Token Creation Platform (TCP) allocates a 0.6% creator participation share from its trading activity. Projects reaching the “graduated” milestone defined in the program documentation may also qualify for a $1 000 builder grant recognizing community traction and onchain engagement.This model directly connects platform success to builder outcomes  ensuring that the value generated through real activity and engagement flows back to the people creating it.The platform also integrates XSWAP as its native liquidity token  linking all deployed assets and helping to establish active markets from day one. By embedding XSWAP at the core of TCP  liquidity becomes a built-in feature of the creation process  not a post-launch challenge.Unveiled live at SmartCon 2025  The Token Creation Platform unites XSwap’s focus on usability  Chainlink’s proven security and interoperability  and Base’s high-performance network to deliver a new foundation for onchain innovation. Together  XSwap and Chainlink provide builders with secure infrastructure to create and connect assets across chains with the mission to bring the next billion people onchain.Builders can start creating and deploying their tokens today at xswap.link and become part of the next chapter of onchain innovation.About ChainlinkChainlink is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Additionally  the data identifies a threshold exposure level of alemtuzumab above which achieving a complete response/complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) is more likely without any increase in toxicities.“We strongly believe in the critical role of alemtuzumab in optimizing responses in these heavily pretreated patients ” said Adrian Kilcoyne  MD  MPH  MBA  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. “These data have confirmed this and demonstrated that we could further enhance the high CR/CRi and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative rates observed in our Phase 1 program. We look forward to starting enrollment in our pivotal Phase 2 program in Q4 2025.”Poster title: Increased alemtuzumab exposure correlates with improved responses in heavily pretreated R/R ALL patients: Analysis of the BALLI-01 trialPresenter: Xenia Naj  Ph.D.  Director Translational Sciences at CellectisDate/Time: December 8  2025  6:00 PM - 8:00 PMRoom: OCCC - West Halls B3-B4These abstracts can now be accessed hereAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The share loan under the Share Lending Agreement will be settled with new shares in the Company to be issued by the Company's Board of Directors (for Tranche 1) pursuant to an authorization granted by the general meeting of the Company held on 29 April 2025 (the ""Board Authorization""). Settlement of the Offer Shares allocated to the Pre-Committing Shareholders in Tranche 1 will not be made on DVP-basis. The payment date for such Offer Shares is expected on or about 6 November 2025. Delivery of such Offer Shares will occur following registration of the share capital increase pertaining to such Offer Shares in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (the “NRBE”)  expected on or about 10 November 2025.The payment date for Offer Shares in Tranche 2 is expected to be on or about 27 November 2025  and the delivery date for such Offer Shares is expected to be on or about 2 December 2025 (subject to the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of such Offer Shares having been registered with the NRBE). The Offer Shares in Tranche 2 and part of the Offer Shares in Tranche 1 to be delivered to Pre-Committing Shareholders and/or Radforsk (as settlement of the share loan described above) will initially be delivered on a separate non-listed ISIN pending approval and publication of a listing prospectus  and the new shares to be issued in Tranche 2 and such part of the Offer Shares to be issued in Tranche 1 will thus not be listed or tradable on Euronext Oslo Børs until such prospectus has been published. Further the issuance of the Offer Shares in Tranche 2 is subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company expected to be held on or about 25 November 2025 (the ""EGM""). All investors in the Private Placement will receive Offer Shares in Tranche 1  except for the Pre-Committing Shareholders who will receive Offer Shares in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2.Completion of the Private Placement is subject to all necessary corporate resolutions of the Company required to implement the Private Placement being validly made by the Company  including  without limitation  the Board resolving to complete the Private Placement  at its sole discretion  including to issue the Offer Shares in Tranche 1 of the Private Placement pursuant to the Board Authorization. Delivery of Offer Shares in Tranche 1 to investors other than the Pre-Committing Shareholders is subject to the Share Lending Agreement being entered into and remaining unmodified and in full force and effect. Delivery of Offer Shares in Tranche 1 to the Pre-Committing Shareholders is subject to the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares in Tranche 1 being registered with the NRBE. Completion of Tranche 2 of the Private Placement is further subject to (i) completion of Tranche 1; (ii) the EGM of the Company resolving to issue the Offer Shares in Tranche 2; and (iii) the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares in Tranche 2 being registered with the NRBE.Tranche 1 of the Private Placement is not conditional upon Tranche 2  and an application for Offer Shares in Tranche 1 will be binding and may not be revoked if Tranche 2  for whatever reason  is not completed. Further  the Private Placement is not conditional on completion of the PrimaryBid Offering.The Company reserves the right to  at any time and for any reason prior to notification of allocation  to cancel the Private Placement and/or to modify the terms of the Private Placement. Neither the Company nor the Manager will be liable for any losses incurred by applicants if the Private Placement is cancelled  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation.The Private Placement and PrimaryBid Offering represent a deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive right to subscribe for and be allocated Offer Shares. The Board has considered the Private Placement and the PrimaryBid Offering in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act  and deems that the proposed Private Placement and PrimaryBid Offering is in compliance with these obligations. The Board is of the view that it will be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity through a private placement. By structuring the equity raise as a private placement  the Company expects to raise equity efficiently  with a lower discount to the current trading price  at a lower cost and with a significantly reduced completion risk compared to a rights issue. Furthermore  by including the PrimaryBid Offering  the Company makes the offering more accessible to all of its existing shareholders. In summary  the Company expects to be in a position to complete the contemplated equity issue in today's market conditions in an efficient manner  at a higher subscription price and at significantly lower cost and with a lower completion risk than would have been the case for a rights issue.The Company may  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  and depending on the participation of the Company's existing shareholders in the Private Placement and the PrimaryBid Offering  consider a subsequent repair offering of new shares at the same subscription price as in the Private Placement and the PrimaryBid Offering  and otherwise in line with market practice.The PrimaryBid OfferingThe PrimaryBid Offering comprises a retail offer of up to the NOK equivalent of EUR 1 million to the public in Norway  subject to an exemption being available from prospectus requirements and any other filing or registration requirements and subject to other selling restrictions.Key highlights and details for the PrimaryBid Offering are as follows:Price per Offer Share: NOK 10Application period: From 3 November 2025 at 16:30 (CET) to 3 November 2025 at 21:00 (CET).No minimum order size.Available for investors in Norway.Applications can only be submitted through Nordnet's website from the start to the end of the application period.The Company may  at its sole discretion  resolve to extend or shorten the application period for the PrimaryBid Offering at any time and for any reason on short or without notice.

In addition to the trials’ clinical efficacy endpoints  PRO instruments are important in determining how patients perceived changes in their symptoms  quality of life  and activities of daily living.“Ulcerative colitis can be a devastating condition that affects every aspect of a person’s daily life  including their ability to work  socialize  and maintain their emotional well-being ” said Marla Dubinsky  MD2  Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine  Chief  Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition  Co-Director  Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Clinical Center  Mount Sinai Kravis Children’s Hospital  Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai New York. “For these patients  improvement isn’t just about controlling inflammation  it’s about regaining a sense of normalcy. That’s why measures of quality of life are so important when evaluating potential new therapies so that we also capture the outcomes that truly matter to patients  and bowel urgency is one of these key factors. The consistency of improvements across all PRO instruments utilized in this program underscores the meaningful benefit obefazimod provided to patients’ daily experience and supports the positive Phase 3 efficacy results observed at week 8. Together  these results highlight obefazimod’s potential to meaningfully advance care for patients with UC.""PRO instruments evaluated in the ABTECT trials include:Bowel urgencyNocturnal bowel movementFatigue numerical rating scale (NRS)Fatigue and ability to function (FACIT-F)Inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ)Overall quality of life (EQ-5D-5L)Workplace productivity (WPAI Domains)Detailed analysis of these PROs will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.Marc de Garidel  MBA  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  commented  “The data shared today further support obefazimod's potential as a meaningful treatment option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Our development efforts  guided by the recognized need for more effective and tolerable long-term therapies  are focused on advancing treatments that can significantly improve patients' quality of life. Taken together with the previously reported positive ABTECT 8-week induction trial results  we are one step closer to realizing this goal. We will be submitting more detailed aspects of this dataset for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting and look forward to sharing results from our 44-week maintenance trial in the second quarter of 2026.”About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Everyone knows very well that the tolerance toward the… Levantine-ness goes through the roof from our politicians  from OPEKEPE all the way to lawlessness or rather the law of the Kalashnikovs  the local mafias  drugs and smuggling. Not that it’s only Crete  but what can we do  the island excels. Even the port authority chief of Chania was appointed there 27 years – mercy  not even Franco in Spain had that! Who doesn’t know that if the state wants  it can within a few months disarm a few villages of Crete and throw behind bars for like ten years each killer from those that roam free and will do the same again? If you see anything serious happening  come hang bells on me…The parody with ELTAThe other topic of the days  which I consider is not a tragedy like the Cretan vendettas but certainly a governmental parody  is the one with ELTA. First a few words about the substance of the matter. State postal services globally have almost collapsed now for about 15 years  gradually  since written correspondence ended from mobiles  SMS and email  deposits and payments (paying bills etc.) are done through banks and of course because of the rapid growth of private courier companies etc. ELTA’s “volume” now is not even 10% of the total market  experts say. So what remains? Maybe service in remote parts of the country  where the grandmother wants to get her power bill and go pay it… manually? Not even the pension  because that is credited automatically to her account  so she needs a bank to see it  if she cannot from her mobile. Fine  very good. So we need a postman to go to Ano Magoula  to the grandmother’s house  and a café  a grocery store  a kiosk or an office at the Community or the Municipality to perform ELTA office duties. This simple thing  which will continue to be done regarding the postman – because they are not abolished nor fired – and the finding  on commission  of another small business to host ELTA services  became a major governmental and political issue  mainly from the blue MPs of the provinces. Because apparently some inside and outside Maximos have… the incomprehensible? Because… they are fighting slaps for free? Or because Mitsotakis must realize that this thing needs pruning or even reshuffle in some cases?Hatzidakis angry…Since we’re talking about the ELTA aftershocks inside Maximos  let me tell you that VP Hatzidakis is fuming (even if he is not that type…) because he believes that in this case he paid for the ELTA  since among other things he was charged also with the CEO of the company  Grigoris Sklicas. Sklicas now  who obviously did not really understand as a technocrat the “sensitivities” of the blues  simply sent an email to the Vice Presidency of the Government and considered that he was covered by what he announced  and so we got the… nice atmosphere. I am told therefore that Hatzidakis will go today to the meeting for ELTA in Maximos after the 3-day absence of K.M abroad  asking in a way from the PM to put things in order. The rest tomorrow.MPs on the railsMeanwhile the blue MPs  in their despair of collecting – maintaining votes  what they say on the phones for three days is unspeakable  while many disagree even with the corrective move of ELTA to immediately close only the stores of Attica Basin and county capitals. That’s why they are waiting… much and much for Sklicas tomorrow in Parliament  since he too considered that because two publications were written  the villages had learned what was going to happen.The “wave” of KarystianouIt is becoming more and more clear to everyone that Maria Karystianou moves in the logic of creating a new party  unrelated to the existing ones and without being identified with Tsipras  Samaras or anyone else. For now she is trying to remain discreetly out or at least… half in half out of the leadership discussion  although this is not easy. In fact yesterday Nikos Karachalios (there is only one!) started teasing with a logo and the name “Wave”  while a video circulated a few days ago where Nikos Nikolopoulos (NikNik  Karachalios’ friend) appeared talking about a “wave” that will come and will be based on values etc. It is obvious that real fermentation is happening here and I am told that there have been outreaches  e.g. to a very known persona of the Left who supported Tsipras and Kasselakis in the recent past. Karystianou however with a late night post threw Karachalios under the bus (why do you think?)  who yesterday spent his whole day retweeting about the “momentum” created by his post. I repeat  we will have a fun winter…Kimberly and table number 30For the first appearance of Kimberly Guilfoyle at the event marking 250 years since the founding of the US Marines Corps a lot has been written  I list who were present from the political and business world. At central table 30 sat Defence Minister Nikos Dendias with his wife Daphne  Shipping and Island Policy Minister Vassilis Kikilias  the Greek-American entrepreneur and co-founder of Vivid Seats  head of Skybox Capital  Eric Vassilatos with his wife Dimitra – with whose plane the Ambassador arrived in Athens – the President of the International Propeller Club of the United States and CEO of Franman Kostis Fragoulis  the President and CEO of the Aktor Group Alexandros Exarchou with his wife and CEO of Credia Bank Eleni Vrettou  the founder and CEO of TEN Nikos Tsakos and Celia Kritharioti  as well as the British-Cypriot entrepreneur and head of the Yiannis Group  Yiannakis (“John”) Christodoulou. Also attending were the President of the Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce Giannis Sarakakis  Guilfoyle’s close associate Christos Marafatsos  Kimberly’s son Ronan Anthony Villency  his father and Kimberly’s ex-husband Eric Villency  the Embassy Chargé d’affaires Josh Huck and Deputy FM Haris Theocharis.When Zappeion becomes the energy HoustonThe capital this week resembles Houston more than the Mediterranean. From Thursday  Athens will host the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation Summit (P-TEC)  with a pantheon of American giants parading at Zappeion  next to the Greek energy crème de la crème. Nearby ExxonMobil  Google  Amazon  Venture Global but also Cheniere and ConocoPhillips  two of the biggest LNG producers worldwide. At the same table will be DTEK  the biggest private natural gas company of Ukraine  and INFRA  one of the strongest corporate groups of Romania. Well  this is how the label “global energy epicenter” that accompanies Athens these days is justified. The government sees in this summit a prime opportunity to show that Greece is no longer just “an energy passage”  but a serious and reliable energy partner. The first talks for LNG deals with American companies are around the corner and somewhere there  in the backstage  deals already are being “cooked” that we will learn in coming days. At the Greek tables  the crème de la crème: George Stassis (PPC)  Konstantinos Xifaras (DEPA Commerce)  Andreas Siamisis (Helleniq Energy)  Mathios Rigas (Energean)  Manos Manousakis (ADMIE) and Maria Rita Galli (DESFA). Earlier  tomorrow Tuesday  the PM will be in Komotini for the inauguration of the DESFA gas compression station that will upgrade Revithoussa’s export capacity from 6 to 8 billion cubic meters  export capacity not bad for a country that until a few years ago was running to fill its tanks. Athens therefore in the coming days will be the epicenter of the energy chessboard. Only – as always – the most interesting game will not be played in the panels  but in the breaks  the huddles and dinners behind closed doors. Where the good deals usually get written. Do not think however that with the transatlantic summit the news ends! Next week Helleniq Energy is preparing to present the new identity of Elpedison  laying the foundations of the “new era” for the supply company that becomes the strategic energy pillar of the group.METLEN landing in DunkirkWe now move to the news from the market which shows increased mobility. First  next Wednesday November 5th we have the semiannual rebalancing of the MSCI indices. Announcements will be made Wednesday night and any changes will apply Monday November 24th. The interest is focused on METLEN stock in relation to the short positions. METLEN the next day November 6 announces results  but the important news for METLEN comes from London and according to that  on November 17 it files with Bank of America as advisor a financial offer for a French aluminum factory in Dunkirk. It is a facility in strategic position since Dunkirk is an important port in the English Channel  it is close to the Belgian border and additionally this particular facility is fueled with nuclear energy. On Thursday November 6 National Bank announces results  while Zappeion becomes Houston as we said above  while on Friday November 7 Alpha Bank announces 9-month results and then SCOPE announces its rating for the Greek economy.Extension for ACSOn the occasion of GLS not exercising on 31/10/25 the first option it had to buy 80% of the courier company ACS  the column was wondering the other day whether the luck of Th. Fessas to do gold-bearing deals had run out. So the answer is no  the luck of the owner of Quest has not run out  since GLS in the end did not exercise the first option for technical reasons that do not cancel the business intentions and dispositions. Therefore  the strong likelihood remains on the table that GLS will proceed with the acquisition exercising the second option on 31/10/2026.The deli meats match: Alexis Yfantis vs Dimitris VintzilaiosThe battle in the domestic deli meats market  roughly 450–500 million euro annually  now seems clearly to be tilting in favor of Alexis Yfantis. The head of the historic meat processing industry YFANTIS  with sales 215.4 million euro and net profits 10.2 million euro in 2024  seems to be standing firmly at the top. And with the deal for the acquisition of Nikas  which is expected to be completed by the end of the year  lifting the consolidated turnover of the new scheme close to 290 million euro  he himself seems to enter 2026 with a clear lead  in a market that is rapidly consolidating. On the other bank  Dimitris Vintzilaios  four years from when he took control of Creta Farms after the “civil war” of the Domazakis brothers that almost destroyed it  continues to struggle to bring it back to a profitable path. A few days ago the company published its financial statements for FY 2024. According to them sales fell marginally to 145.9 million euro and net losses increased to about 1 million euro  from 105k euro in 2023.LAMDA: the coastal front shapings also proceedLAMDA Development is running on multiple “fronts”  which as announced at the end of last week also formally proceeds with the procedures for issuing a common bond loan up to 500 million  with a minimum amount 400 million euro and 7 year duration. In the latest developments with regards to the big Elliniko project it is of interest that the coastal front shaping now also proceeds  beyond of course the construction of the commercial spaces at Riviera Galleria  the Residential Tower with its 173 houses and the separate low-rise residential complexes – 115 in number – known also as “Cove Residences” (note: on the coastal front are also the 27 plots on the sea where the villas that have already been sold will be built). Now  approval has been requested from the competent services of the Ministry of Culture of the file relating to the definitive landscape architectural study of the common areas  part of the open space and the central pedestrian walkway  the beach and the shoreline on the coastal front  within the area of the Metropolitan Pole. It is noted here that the coastal front will also be the first to be inhabited in the new Elliniko city and the target that has been set especially for the houses of “Cove Residences” is the first tenants to move in towards the end of 2026 – start of 2027.Piraeus Bank new provisions at 70 million euro in Q3According to information  from the new provisions of around 70 million euro about half concern the step up loans  i.e. prudence for those customers of the bank who do not want to change their instalments from step up to amortizing  and the other half concern the loans in Swiss francs where here too most have been restructured as step up. Old restructurings of the banks during the crisis where the incomes of their customers fell dramatically  promoted very low instalments at the beginning of the loan and much higher towards the end (step up loans). The SSM demanded forcefully that these restructurings change within 2026 because customers were paying only interest during the first years of the loan  otherwise the banks will have to take additional provisions. Banks have started contacts with their customers offering as lure attractive rates to accept to convert their loans into amortizing. The signed loan contracts with the clientele cannot be changed unilaterally and obviously some borrowers will not accept the change. For these  provisions are gradually being taken. Regarding the loans in Swiss francs  the government regulation is expected. Given that 2026 is an election year  it is not excluded that the awaited regulation will lead to a generous haircut for this category of loans  in which case bank provisions will need to be increased. It is understood that the above concerns the loan portfolios of all banks with step up restructurings and loans in Swiss francs.Diamantis Diamantidis  the two tankers and the HouthisThe Greek shipowner Diamantis Diamantidis is setting his fleet in motion again. Delta Tankers agreed to acquire two of the most modern suezmax in circulation  the 156 800 dwt Crude Levante and Crude Zephyrus (built 2021)  which however have not yet been officially delivered. The ships were bought from Greek-owned Metrostar Management  for about 77.5 million dollars each. The move also makes sense for Metrostar  which had ordered the ships equipped with scrubber six years ago for 56.5 million dollars each – i.e. about 72 million dollars today. For Delta  this acquisition is strategic. The price is moving at market levels and the ships represent the most modern available capacity in the secondary market  a clear message that Diamantidis is ready to renew his fleet. The rumors in the market wanted the Greek shipowner to be searching for suitable ships for quite some time. The current move  however  is not a simple replacement of the 163 800 dwt Sounion (2006)  which had been sold for scrap after a Houthi attack last year. For many in the market  it is a sign of confidence in the good path of the crude carriers market. Delta Tankers  specialist in crude carrier ships  with 22 suezmax  five VLCC and one aframax  had not bought any ship in the secondary market for over three years.How Peter Livanos prepares GasLog for the next dayThe sale of the Methane Jane Elizabeth for $25 million  from the US listed GasLog Partners of Peter Livanos  slightly above scrap value  is not just a typical clearing of old tonnage LNG carrier. It is a clear signal that the company is accelerating its strategy to remove aging vessels  reduce idle days (the days a ship is not chartered) and prepare for an LNG market that remains weak but with prospects of recovery. The quarterly loss and the impairments of $22.3 million show the “pain” on the balance sheet  but are strategically calculated moves for the portfolio to be cleaned up. The reductions of available days due to redelivery and sale-and-leaseback agreements highlight the real challenges in the market  while the lower fixtures for 2025 underscore the pressure on freight. However  GasLog appears ready to exploit the next phase of the LNG market  with possible partnerships  fleet redeployments and upgrades in 2026. To Wall Street insiders  this move is considered a clear sign. The company is clearing old assets to bet on the next opportunity  leaving behind old LNG carriers and strengthening its position in an environment where available transport capacity and flexibility in the spot market will determine profitability.Ordering newbuildings and buying second-hand the GreeksGreek interests remained strongly present both in the newbuilding market and the S&P market this week. Thanasis Martinos’ EastMed continued its expansion course  ordering two MR2 tankers at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard  confirming the continuous confidence of Greek shipowners in the clean products sector. In dry bulk  the largest order was placed by Efnav Company of the Efstathiou brothers and concerns the construction of six Kamsarmax bulk carriers  82 000 dwt. These will be built in China by Hengli Shipbuilding  at $35 million per vessel. Also Seanergy Maritime of Stamatis Tsantanis and Capital Ship Management proceeded with new orders for Capesize bulkers at Chinese yards  confirming their commitment to a modern fleet  while the order for two VLCC from Alimia Group at a Chinese yard further strengthened Greek presence in the crude tanker sector. In the secondary market  Minoa Marine sold the Anthos (82 000 dwt  2017) for around $33 million  while George Delaporta’s Meadway Shipping disposed of the Dionisis (82 000 dwt  2015) for $30.5 million  both cases to undisclosed buyers. Meanwhile  the Seacon Manila (33 000 dwt  2016) was valued at $17.1 million for delivery to Greek interests in 2025.Cenergy hit €3 billionIn the absence of other significant geopolitical news and corporate announcements  with the Athens Stock Exchange being +35.78% higher since the beginning of the year  the average daily traded value  last week (which was a down week)  reached €254.5 million – up +13.1% compared to the immediately previous week. In the ten-month period Jan–Oct the average daily traded value was €214.2 million  i.e. +54.5% compared to the same period of 2024. The shares of the Viohalco group climbed to new peaks  having decoupled from the negative sentiment that prevails in the Greek stock market in recent days. Cenergy Holdings marked a new all-time high  reaching €14.4 and counts a positive 6×7 which has boosted it overall by almost 10%. Its market cap now exceeds €3 billion  is in 13th place based on ATHEX capitalisations  has surpassed Titan and Motor Oil in value  and is approaching Athens International Airport. All time high also for Viohalco  which has had a four-day rally with total gains over 4%. It is one breath short of €8.5 and its market value touches €2.2 billion. The other group stock  ElvalHalcor  erased the losses it had recorded in last Thursday’s session and matched the YTD record of €3.2  while hitting €3.245 at intraday highs. These are levels it has not seen for 18 years and specifically since late December 2007 – early January 2008. Recently it entered the billionaires club  with its valuation now amounting to €1.2 billion.Piraeus MFMC at 3.34% of ATHEXIt is heard in the market that ATHEX shareholders are taking battle positions  with some entrenched so that the Euronext proposal does not pass (hoping to lead the stubborn Stéphan Boujnah to an improved offer) and others supporting it. What of this corresponds to reality and who will prevail  time will show. Soon we’ll find out anyway. However  on Friday  Piraeus MFMC announced on ATHEX that in the last two months it has proceeded with the purchase of 355 000 shares of ATHEX  for €2.33 million  increasing from 2.75% to 3.34% its percentage and voting rights. If you wonder now what stance the column will take  without having information  it would bet that as one of the largest domestic institutional investors  it will support the deal.New investment strategy with ATHEX sharesOn this occasion  let’s say that in the brokerage offices of Athens  a new “investment philosophy” is gaining ground. The public tender of Euronext  which started on October 6 and ends on November 17  2025  offers an exchange of 0.050 Euronext shares for each ATHEX share. However  the recent fall of the Euronext share to €124 shapes the proposal at €6.21  lower than the initially improved offer of €7.14 in July. This slide in price created a new popular investment strategy: brokers advise their clients (not only retail clients) to cash in immediately their ATHEX shares at current market prices  avoiding the risk of further fall of Euronext until completion. If Euronext continues its downward course from the highs of €153.50 in the last 52 weeks  for the retail investor  the certainty of today’s €6.24/share outweighs the uncertainty of the exchange. On the other hand  the funds cooperating with Euronext are buying carefully  quietly and systematically the shares that the impatient are liquidating. Every share sold in the market is one less that will have to be exchanged later. Until November 17 this game of fear and opportunity will continue on the electronic boards of the Athens Stock Exchange. Retail plays for safety. Euronext plays for control.Artificial intelligence is “hitting” Wall Street bankers tooCNBC revealed that JP Morgan Chase  the world’s largest bank by market cap  is planning a dramatic restructuring of its staff  aiming to reduce the ratio of junior bankers to senior bankers from 6:1 today to 4:1. The real disruption is hidden in one detail. Half of the junior bankers will work “remotely”  since they will live in cities with much lower cost of living such as Buenos Aires for example  instead of being crammed in the extremely expensive apartments of unfriendly New York. Thus a new reality is being created. The well-dressed young bankers with expensive tastes who have moved to London and New York for a better life as cinema shows it  now face a potential reduction of up to 2/3 of their jobs. Derek Waldron  Chief Analytics Officer of JP Morgan  showed how the bank’s artificial intelligence systems create a five-page investment presentation on Nvidia in about 30 seconds. It is a task that in the past needed a whole team of junior bankers and many hours of work. If JP Morgan’s plan is implemented  young investment bankers will work in shifts  in different time zones  passing the baton from one location to another  providing 24/7 support to the senior bankers. Lower costs  higher profit margins. On the other hand  if young investment bankers do not work long hours for research  studies and models  how will they develop to one day become the wise bankers of tomorrow? Waldron answers that employees will shift from “makers” to “checkers”  managers of artificial intelligence systems.,neutral,0.01,0.66,0.33,mixed,0.26,0.16,0.58,True,English,"['cold cuts', 'tragedy', 'Crete', 'parody', 'ELTA', 'Karystianou', 'Wave', 'Zappeion', 'Houston', 'Kimberly', 'table', 'port authority chief', 'private courier companies', 'US Marines Corps', 'late night post', 'State postal services', 'ELTA office duties', 'bad side', 'timeless responsibilities', 'dark side', 'local mafias', 'other topic', 'Cretan vendettas', 'paying bills', 'rapid growth', 'total market', 'remote parts', 'power bill', 'Ano Magoula', 'grocery store', 'small business', 'major governmental', 'political issue', 'Vice Presidency', 'nice atmosphere', '3-day absence', 'K.M', 'corrective move', 'Attica Basin', 'county capitals', 'two publications', 'new party', 'leadership discussion', 'Nikos Nikolopoulos', 'real fermentation', 'recent past', 'fun winter', 'table number', 'first appearance', 'ELTA services', 'blue MPs', 'Nikos Karachalios', 'Karachalios’ friend', 'governmental parody', 'simple thing', 'other things', 'three days', 'Kimberly Guilfoyle', 'ELTA aftershocks', 'ten years', 'VP Hatzidakis', 'Grigoris Sklicas', 'Maria Karystianou', '15 years', '250 years', 'Newsroom', 'barbarities', 'place', 'Crete', 'yesterday', 'Greece', 'course', 'governments', 'exception', 'decades', 'Everyone', 'tolerance', 'Levantine-ness', 'roof', 'politicians', 'OPEKEPE', 'lawlessness', 'Kalashnikovs', 'drugs', 'smuggling', 'island', 'Chania', 'mercy', 'Franco', 'Spain', 'months', 'villages', 'bars', 'killer', 'hang', 'bells', 'tragedy', 'words', 'substance', 'matter', 'correspondence', 'mobiles', 'SMS', 'email', 'deposits', 'payments', 'banks', 'volume', 'experts', 'country', 'grandmother', 'pension', 'account', 'postman', 'house', 'café', 'kiosk', 'Community', 'Municipality', 'finding', 'commission', 'provinces', 'Maximos', 'slaps', 'Mitsotakis', 'pruning', 'cases', 'type', 'CEO', 'company', 'technocrat', 'sensitivities', 'blues', 'meeting', 'way', 'PM', 'order', 'rest', 'rails', 'despair', 'votes', 'phones', 'stores', 'Parliament', 'wave', 'logic', 'existing', 'Tsipras', 'Samaras', 'half', 'fact', 'logo', 'name', 'video', 'NikNik', 'values', 'outreaches', 'known', 'persona', 'Left', 'Kasselakis', 'momentum', 'event', 'founding', 'lot']",2025-11-03,2025-11-04,en.protothema.gr
