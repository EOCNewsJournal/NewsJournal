See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up  you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .Chainlink positioned CRE as a foundation for the tokenization shift  pointing out that major institutions including Swift  Euroclear  UBS  and Mastercard are adopting it “to capture the $867 trillion tokenization opportunity.”CRE was first unveiled a year ago  where Chainlink likened the platform’s significance to that of Java’s development environment for the internet era.Unlike previous blockchain tooling  CRE offers a single environment where developers can write smart contracts that work across multiple blockchains  tap into legacy financial messaging standards like ISO 20022  and comply with regulatory requirements.CRE also includes access to Chainlink's existing services such as price feeds and proof-of-reserve systems.A number of major players are already using the platform. JPMorgan’s Kinexys and Ondo completed a cross-chain settlement using CRE  while UBS Tokenize and DigiFT leveraged it for the first-ever on-chain redemption of a tokenized fund.“Smart contracts have evolved into a more complex form  requiring synchronization across chains  connectivity to data and identity  as well as synchronization with many other existing systems ” said Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.“These advanced institutional smart contracts have previously taken months to years to get right  and with the launch of CRE we can now reduce that down to weeks or even just days ” Nazarov added.Chainlink plans to add privacy features in early 2026  including confidential computing for institutions that require secure handling of proprietary data.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

These CD8+ T cells target multiple neoantigens encoded in the vaccine  have tissue resident cytosignature  and are still detectable up to two years after the start of TG4050 treatment. Overall  these data support the TG4050 mechanism of action that resulted in the reduction of risk of relapse observed in the randomized Phase I study.These data have been generated from the randomized Phase I part of the ongoing Phase I/II trial evaluating TG4050 as a single agent in the adjuvant treatment of HPV-negative HNSCC  in patients that are in complete response following surgery and adjuvant (chemo-)radiotherapy.These results follow the positive randomized Phase I data presented in a rapid oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO Annual Meeting – see press release).The SITC abstract is available both on the SITC and Transgene websites. The poster presentation will take place on November 8 at the Conference and will be available on Transgene’s website following the presentation.Transgene will host a webcast (in English) to discuss the SITC data on November 14  2025  from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. ET (16:00 to 17:00 CET). The webcast and the replay will be available here and on Transgene‘s website.Transgene expects to complete the randomization of patients with operable HNSCC in the Phase II part of the trial by early 2026. First immunogenicity data from this Phase II part are expected to be available in H2 2026. The first efficacy data (2-year disease-free survival  DFS) will become available as soon as all patients are evaluable for two-year DFS with either an event (relapse or death) or 2-year follow-up whichever occurs first.Transgene is currently evaluating the most efficient regulatory pathway to accelerate the development of its lead asset  TG4050  with the goal of bringing it to patients with operable HNSCC as quickly as possible.myvac® platform: Potential to reduce the risk of relapse across multiple operable solid tumorsTransgene’s INTV platform  myvac®  could be applied across a range of solid tumors where in many cases a significant unmet medical need remains. In parallel  Transgene is initiating start-up activities for a potential new Phase I trial in a second indication in an early treatment setting  with the aim of initiating once all conditions are met.BT-001 (oncolytic virus - intratumoral administration): Updated Phase I/II data presented at ESMO 2025 demonstrated positive antitumoral activityTransgene and BioInvent presented a poster on updated clinical results showing the positive antitumoral activity of BT-001 in patients with advanced refractory tumors at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Meeting – see press release.These updated data from the Phase I trial (NCT04725331) evaluating BT-001 in combination with MSD’s (Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA) anti-PD-1 therapy  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)2 showed positive local  abscopal and sustained antitumoral activity in injected and non-injected lesions. Immune-mediated tumor shrinkage is consistent with the mechanistic hypothesis that BT-001  in combination with pembrolizumab  turns “cold” tumors into immunologically active ones.The poster is available on Transgene’s website.Transgene and BioInvent are exploring clinical development opportunities for intratumoral administration of BT-001 in collaboration with clinicians.Key financial elementsIn millions of euros Q3 2025 2024 Research Tax Credit 5.8 4.8 Revenue from collaborative and licensing agreements 0.1 - Other income 0.3 0.2 Operating income 6.13 5.0During the third quarter of 2025  the Research Tax Credit increased to €5.8 million compared to €4.8 million for the same period in 2024  reflecting the progress of the ongoing Phase II part of the clinical trial evaluating TG4050 in head and neck cancer  with sustained patient enrollment and related expenses  including the manufacturing of individualized batches.As of September 30  2025  Transgene had €12.8 million in cash  compared to €16.7 million as of December 31  2024.Over the first nine months of 2025  Transgene’s net cash burn4 was €28.8 million (including the prefinancing of the 2024 Research Tax Credit for €5.2 million in June 2025) compared to €31.3 million for the same period in 2024.Business funded until the end of December 2026In March 2025  the Company signed a new amendment to the current account advance agreement with its major shareholder TSGH (Institut Mérieux)  which increased the total amount of the facility by €15 million to €48 million.

See details below.Strasbourg  France & Tokyo  Japan  November 4  2025  5:45 p.m. CET – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  and NEC Corporation (NEC; TSE: 6701)  a leader in IT  network and AI technologies  will jointly present additional immunological data profiling the immune response after treatment with the individualized neoantigen therapeutic vaccine (INTV) TG4050 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. The conference will be held in National Harbor  Maryland  USA  from November 5 to 9  2025.Comprehensive immunogenicity data confirm TG4050’s ability to induce neoantigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses capable of targeting and eliminating tumor cells  thereby contributing to the prevention of cancer relapse  when used as monotherapy.Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Medical Oncologist at Gustave Roussy  and Principal Investigator  commented: “These new immunological data provide compelling evidence confirming TG4050’s mechanism of action. They also offer a clear rationale for the sustained prevention of relapses  which is a critical outcome for long-term patient benefit.”Data presented at SITC demonstrate that TG4050 monotherapy induces a potent CD8+ T cell response consistent with durable anti-tumor immunity:Vaccine-induced cytotoxic CD8+ T cells display an effector phenotype even one year after the end of treatment  suggesting potential long-term effector functions.even one year after the end of treatment  suggesting potential long-term effector functions. CD8+ T cells express high levels of cytotoxic and tissue-resident biomarkers  suggesting that these cells are effective at killing cancer cells and likely to be found not only in the blood but also in tissues  where they can scout for and eliminate tumor cells.The abstract is available on both the SITC and Transgene websites. The poster presentation will take place on November 8 and will be available that day on both the SITC and Transgene’s websites.Dr. Emmanuelle Dochy  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene  said: “We are extremely proud to present new immunological data that further characterize the CD8+ T cell responses against the selected neoantigens. These translational data confirm that the vaccine selected neoantigens induce an efficient immune response. TG4050 is currently being evaluated in the Phase II part of our ongoing Phase I/II study. The first immunogenicity data from this Phase II part are expected to be available in the second half of 2026.”Motoo Nishihara  Corporate EVP and CTO  at NEC  added: “These findings highlight the strong potential of NEC’s AI-driven platform in enabling the development of individualized neoantigen therapeutic vaccines. The confirmation of the mechanism of action and evidence of durable relapse prevention mark important milestones that reinforce our dedication to revolutionizing cancer treatment through cutting-edge AI innovation.”Transgene and NEC previously shared data (see press release) illustrating that CD8+ T cells specific to tumor neoantigens have been detected in patients treated with TG4050. These cells target multiple neoantigens encoded in the vaccine and their responses persist for up to two years after the start of the treatment.Transgene will host a webcast (in English) to discuss the SITC data on November 14  2025  from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. ET (4 p.m. to 5 p.m. CET).Webcast link to English language conference call:https://lifescievents.com/event/fsp25g74n/The webcast and the replay will be available here and on Transgene’s website following the live event.***ContactsTransgene: Media: Investors & Analysts: Caroline Tosch Lucie Larguier Corporate and Scientific Communications Manager Chief Financial Officer (CFO) +33 (0)3 68 33 27 38 Nadege Bartoli communication@transgene.fr Investor Relations Analystand Financial Communications Officer MEDiSTRAVA +33 (0)3 88 27 91 00/03 Frazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi investorrelations@transgene.fr + 44 (0) 203 928 6900 transgene@medistrava.comAbout TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Transgene has set up an innovative network that combines bioengineering  digital transformation  established vectorization know-how and unique manufacturing capabilities. Transgene has been awarded “Investment for the Future” funding from Bpifrance for the development of its platform myvac®. TG4050 is the first myvac®-derived product being evaluated in clinical trials. Click here to watch a short video on myvac®.About TG4050TG4050 is an individualized immunotherapy being developed for solid tumors that is based on Transgene’s myvac® technology and powered by NEC’s longstanding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) expertise. This virus-based individualized neoantigen therapeutic vaccine (INTV) encodes neoantigens (patient-specific mutations) identified and selected by NEC’s Neoantigen Prediction System. The prediction system is based on more than two decades of expertise in AI and has been trained on proprietary data allowing it to accurately prioritize and select the most immunogenic sequences.TG4050 is designed to stimulate the immune system of patients in order to induce a T-cell response that is able to recognize and destroy tumor cells based on their own neoantigens. This individualized immunotherapy is developed and produced for each patient.About the Phase I/II Clinical TrialTG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166). An individualized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants received their vaccine immediately after completing adjuvant treatment. The other half were given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to standard of care (SoC). This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who are at risk of relapse. In the Phase I part  thirty-two evaluable patients have been included. First immunogenicity data from the Phase II part of the trial are expected to be available in H2 2026. The first efficacy data will become available as soon as all patients display two-year follow-up from randomization unless an event (relapse  death or lost to follow-up) occurs earlier.About NEC’s Neoantigen Prediction SystemNEC’s neoantigen prediction system utilizes its proprietary AI  such as graph-based relational learning  trained on multiple sources of biological data to discover candidate neoantigen targets. These targets are carefully analyzed using proprietary machine learning algorithms that include in-house HLA binding and antigen presentation AI tools to evaluate the likelihood of eliciting a robust and clinically relevant T-cell response.

Participants received two administrations  four weeks apart  of a low  medium or high dose of the highly purified inactivated aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine candidate VLA1601. In addition  the low dose of VLA1601 was evaluated with additional adjuvants  either the CpG 1018® adjuvant from Dynavax Technologies Corporation or the 3M-052-AF adjuvant from the Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI).Data up to Day 57 (four weeks after the second dose (Part A Analysis)) showed that VLA1601 was generally safe and well tolerated in all five treatment arms  and no safety concerns were identified. Additionally  an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board did not reveal any safety issues.Two doses of VLA1601 were immunogenic across all five treatment arms investigated (i.e.  alum-adjuvanted Low  Medium and High antigen dose; Low with additional adjuvants). The strongest immune response was observed in the double-adjuvant treatment arms (Low+alum+3M-052-AF and Low+alum+CpG1018) with statistically significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers (Geometric Mean Titers - GMTs) at Day 43 and Day 57 than in the single-adjuvant (alum) treatment arm.The immune response induced by the double-adjuvanted VLA1601 second generation vaccine candidate was successfully improved compared to the first-generation vaccine candidate with higher peak seroconversion rates (>93% vs 86%) and peak Geometric Mean Fold Increase of titers (>56 fold vs >7 fold). Phase 1 results from Valneva’s first-generation Zika vaccine candidate were reported in 20181.VLA1601 is developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased by the notable safety and immunogenicity results demonstrated for our Zika vaccine candidate and especially our double-adjuvantation results. As global temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shifts  the expanding habitat of disease-carrying mosquitoes poses a growing public health challenge for infections such as Zika.”Despite the medical need  regulatory pathways and market opportunities for potential Zika vaccines remain uncertain. Valneva will therefore only consider further potential development steps for VLA1601 if concrete major private and public funding opportunities materialize.About the Zika VirusThe Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first discovered in 1947. The first human cases were detected in 1952. Since then  disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  in 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus is currently circulating in Mexico  Central and South America  in many countries and territories in the Caribbean region  and in a small number of geographically limited areas of the continental United States. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-born Zika virus transmission  though global surveillance remains limited. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  there is scientific consensus that ZIKV infection can cause congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Since 2013  31 countries and territories have reported cases of congenital microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations associated with Zika virus infection.About VLA1601VLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus (ZIKV)  developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe. Valneva reported positive Phase 1 results for VLA1601 in 20182. The vaccine candidate was immunogenic and showed a favorable safety profile in all tested doses and schedules that was comparable to IXIARO® and other clinical stage ZIKV vaccines.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
