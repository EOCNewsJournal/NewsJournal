53556,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/627373-eu-commissioner-russian-assets/,Ex-EU justice head charged with money laundering,Former EU Commissioner Didier Reynders  who oversaw the bloc’s seizure of Russian assets  has been charged with money laundering Read Full Article at RT.com,Didier Reynders  who spearheaded the bloc’s seizure of Russian assets  now faces a criminal probe in BelgiumBelgian prosecutors have charged former EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders with money laundering  local media have reported. The veteran official  who led the bloc’s campaign to freeze Russian state assets  is accused of channeling hundreds of thousands of euros through personal bank accounts and lottery winnings.Reynders served as Belgium’s finance minister from 1999 to 2011 and foreign minister until 2019  before becoming justice commissioner in the first European Commission led by Ursula von der Leyen  where he oversaw Russian sanctions enforcement and asset-freeze coordination after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.According to reports on Tuesday  the case centers on the origins of nearly €1 million ($1.2 million) linked to Reynders’ finances. Investigators allege he laundered about €700 000 through his bank account over a decade and another €200 000 by purchasing large quantities of lottery tickets and transferring the winnings to his account. His wife  a retired magistrate  has also been questioned  but not charged.The inquiry follows raids on Reynders’ properties in December 2024  shortly after his EU mandate expired. Judge Olivier Leroux formally indicted him last month after a second round of questioning  having found serious indications of guilt  the investigative outlet Follow the Money reported. Reynders denies wrongdoing and remains free while the case proceeds.Under Belgian law  prosecutors must obtain parliamentary approval to bring a former minister to trial. Money laundering carries a potential five-year prison sentence.The development comes as the bloc continues to debate how to use around $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets to fund Ukraine. EU leaders have so far failed to agree on whether to channel the funds – most of which are held at the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear – into a controversial loan program to support Kiev  after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards. International law prohibits the confiscation of sovereign assets  a rule that many EU capitals  the ECB  and the IMF insist is unbreakable.Moscow has condemned both the freeze and any plans to repurpose the funds. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that channeling Russian assets to Ukraine would “boomerang” against the West. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov promised a reciprocal response.,neutral,0.0,0.66,0.34,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['Ex-EU justice head', 'money laundering', 'former EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'potential five-year prison sentence', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'many EU capitals', 'first European Commission', 'Judge Olivier Leroux', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'controversial loan program', 'stronger legal safeguards', 'personal bank accounts', 'Russian sanctions enforcement', 'Russian state assets', 'former minister', 'EU mandate', 'EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'foreign minister', 'Reynders’ finances', 'Reynders’ properties', 'sovereign assets', 'criminal probe', 'local media', 'veteran official', 'asset-freeze coordination', 'large quantities', 'lottery tickets', 'retired magistrate', 'second round', 'serious indications', 'investigative outlet', 'Belgian law', 'parliamentary approval', 'International law', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'reciprocal response', 'money laundering', 'Belgian prosecutors', 'lottery winnings', 'Ukraine conflict', 'bloc', 'seizure', 'Belgium', 'campaign', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'euros', 'escalation', 'reports', 'Tuesday', 'case', 'origins', 'Investigators', 'decade', 'wife', 'inquiry', 'raids', 'December', 'questioning', 'guilt', 'wrongdoing', 'trial', 'development', 'funds', 'Kiev', 'confiscation', 'rule', 'ECB', 'IMF', 'Moscow', 'plans', 'West']",2025-11-05,2025-11-06,rt.com

Shares shall  in case of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right to subscription  be issued on market terms.

The reason for the deviation from pre-emption rights  with regard to transfers made in conjunction with the acquisition of companies and businesses  is to create alternative forms of payment for such acquisitions.

All issued and outstanding SDRs will be delisted and converted into A Shares in connection with the Listing  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SDRs.The Sampo A share has since 22 November 2022 been listed on Nasdaq Stockholm through SDRs  with Svenska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (“SEB”) as the issuer of the SDRs and as a market maker and liquidity provider. Earlier this year  Euroclear Sweden decided to reopen its so-called CSD-links to new foreign issuers from certain jurisdictions effective as of September 2025  including from Finland  which were not available at the time of the establishment of the SDR arrangement. This policy change by Euroclear Sweden has now made it possible for Sampo to pursue a direct listing of the A share on Nasdaq Stockholm  instead of maintaining the current SDR arrangement with SEB  to create a uniform Nordic listing structure consistent with its listings on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Copenhagen.The advantages for Sampo and its shareholders  similarly to the listings on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Copenhagen  include increasing the maximum available liquidity pool in the Swedish market to cover all issued A Shares  a smaller tick size on Nasdaq Stockholm in comparison to the one applicable for the SDRs  and the possibility for current SDR holders to exercise shareholder rights without the involvement of SEB as an intermediary. Sampo’s Board of Directors has therefore resolved to request the termination of the SDR arrangement with SEB and to consequently carry out the Listing.A formal termination notice in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SDRs will be published in Svenska Dagbladet on or about 6 November 2025.The application to delist the SDRs from Nasdaq Stockholm is planned to be submitted in February 2026 and the application for the admission to trading of the A Share on Nasdaq Stockholm will be submitted concurrently.Sampo has today published an exemption document and Q&A materials to provide information about the SDR conversion process and the Listing. The exemption document can be obtained at www.sampo.com/duallisting and the Q&A can be found at www.sampo.com/irblog.Important datesOn or about 13 February 2026Last day of trading in the SDRs on Nasdaq Stockholm On or about 16 February 2026 (trades carried out on the first day of trading will be settled with a T+3 schedule) First day of trading in the A Shares on Nasdaq Stockholm On or about 17 February 2026 Record date for SDR conversion On or about 19 February 2026 Delivery of A Shares to SDR holdersSampo reserves the right to amend the dates  if necessary.

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reports third quarter 2025 revenue of $435 million  a 22% increase compared to the third quarter 2024 revenue of $356 million. AMG achieved a…,Amsterdam  5 November 2025 (Regulated Information) --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reports third quarter 2025 revenue of $435 million  a 22% increase compared to the third quarter 2024 revenue of $356 million. AMG achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $64 million  a 58% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $40 million  driven primarily by the AMG Technologies segment.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “Our third quarter performance remained strong  driven by continued momentum in AMG Technologies with AMG Engineering’s order backlog  as well as high profitability in AMG Antimony. Additionally  we benefited from a $5 million compensation settlement at AMG Vanadium for an equipment failure related to our growth investment in Zanesville. While the indirect effects of increased tariffs and trade barriers on our business remain difficult to assess  we remain focused on the elements within our control—executing operationally  strengthening our balance sheet  and streamlining our portfolio. The divestment of our natural graphite business represents a key step in this strategy  and we expect the transaction to close later this year.The current low-price environment in our two main products  lithium and vanadium  continues to constrain profitability and cash generation. However  we remain actively engaged in developing new business opportunities driven by the accelerating trend toward onshoring critical materials production. Combined with the inevitable recovery of the lithium and vanadium markets  these initiatives position AMG well for sustained long-term value creation. We look forward to sharing further updates in the coming quarters.We are currently processing high-purity chrome metal in our New Castle  PA plant  and starting in the second quarter of 2026 we will expand production  backwards integrate and become the only chrome metal producer in the United States. We will continue to establish critical material processing facilities in the US  and are targeting niobium metal and antimony oxide. We will also expand our US titanium alloys capacity to keep up with our customer’s increasing demand for aerospace applications. And it bears noting that in addition to these expansions  our Ohio spent catalyst recycling facility is the only ferrovanadium producer in the US.”AMG Lithium B.V.After successfully commissioning the lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld in May and having produced material in specification  we are making progress on the ramp-up of the plant and the qualification process with customers as planned. We are now producing multi-ton batches from raw materials of mixed origin according to specification. This marks a significant step on our way to commercial production.Last month  AMG Lithium GmbH signed a memorandum of understanding with Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co.  Ltd. (“Easpring”) for the supply and offtake of battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate. AMG Lithium’s and Easpring’s investments in Europe underline the joint commitment to a localized battery supply chain. As a first step  both companies are collaborating closely to ensure a successful qualification of AMG Lithium’s plant while negotiating a binding offtake agreement.AMG Vanadium B.V.SARBV’s development with Advanced Circular Materials Company (ACMC) “Supercenter” phase 1 project in Saudi Arabia remains on schedule in the detailed engineering phase. The EPC contract has been awarded on a full notice to proceed basis and pre-construction works are expected to begin very soon. In addition  ACMC has established an office in Jubail and has begun hiring permanent staff members.AMG TechnologiesAMG Technologies achieved a very strong result  driven by an ongoing high order backlog at AMG Engineering and strong profitability from AMG Antimony. Adjusted EBITDA of $41 million in the third quarter of 2025 was more than double the $19 million for the segment in the same period last year.Last month  AMG and Asbury Carbons announced the signing of a definitive agreement for AMG to sell Graphit Kropfmühl GmbH to Asbury Carbons  a portfolio company of Mill Rock Capital. The transaction reflects an enterprise value of $65 million  and AMG will use the proceeds from this transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on its core growth businesses. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals  and AMG and Asbury Carbons expect the sale to close by year-end 2025.Financial HighlightsAMG’s liquidity as of September 30  2025 was $419 million  with $220 million of unrestricted cash and $199 million of revolving credit availability.AMG’s adjusted gross profit of $88 million in the third quarter of 2025 was 38% higher than the same period in 2024. This significant improvement was largely driven by AMG Technologies’ strong performance compared to the prior quarter.Net income attributable to shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 was $13 million  the highest since the second quarter of 2023  yielding $0.39 diluted earnings per share.AMG delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $64 million in the third quarter  58% higher than in the same period last year despite the continued weakness in lithium and lack of a notable recovery in vanadium prices.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q3 ‘25 Q3 ‘24 Change Revenue $434 692 $356 003 22% Gross profit 89 976 46 098 95% Adjusted gross profit (1) 87 997 63 675 38% Adjusted gross margin 20.2% 17.9% Operating profit (loss) 36 014 (1 252) N/A Operating margin 8.3% (0.4%) Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders 13 074 (13 353) N/A EPS - Fully diluted 0.39 (0.41) N/A EBIT (2) 46 882 25 408 85% Adjusted EBITDA (3) 63 622 40 266 58% Adjusted EBITDA margin 14.6% 11.3% Cash used in operating activities (6 908) (1 822) (279%)Notes:(1) Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding restructuring  asset impairment  inventory cost adjustments  strategic project expenses and other exceptional items.(2) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

The decline was primarily driven by an 8% reduction in lithium market prices  a 32% decrease in lithium concentrate sales volumes  and a 64% decrease in tantalum sales volumes due to shipping delays that will be reversed in the fourth quarter. These impacts were partially offset by higher average tantalum sales prices versus the third quarter of 2024.The decrease in lithium concentrate volumes was mainly driven by the continued effect of the failure during the second quarter of 2025 of one piece of equipment associated with our expansion project. We are addressing the issue and are currently operating at 110 thousand tons of production per year.SG&A expenses of $14 million during the third quarter of 2025 were 15% higher than in the same period of 2024  mainly driven by the increase in personnel costs related to the commissioning and ramp-up of the lithium hydroxide refinery and higher professional fees.The third quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA decreased 72% compared to the third quarter of 2024  primarily due to the lower volumes in the current quarter and the decline in lithium prices as noted above  partially offset by higher average tantalum sales prices.During the third quarter of 2025  a total of 15 409 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates were sold  16% more than the 13 278 dmt in the second quarter of 2025  but 32% less than the 22 731 dmt in the third quarter of 2024. Volumes were negatively impacted in the current quarter by the technical issues noted above.The average realized sales price was $530/dmt CIF China for the quarter  and the average cost per ton was $420/dmt CIF China. The average cost per ton decreased from $450/dmt in the third quarter 2024 due to the lower cost of mining activities in the current quarter.AMG VanadiumQ3 ‘25 Q3 ‘24 Change Revenue $153 995 $150 972 2% Adjusted gross profit 25 514 15 858 61% Operating profit (loss) 8 114 (2 573) N/A Adjusted EBITDA 19 471 10 762 81%AMG Vanadium’s revenue for the third quarter of 2025 increased by 2%  to $154 million  due primarily to increased sales prices in ferrovanadium and chrome metal. These increased sales prices were partially offset by lower volumes of ferrovanadium driven by production issues from our refinery suppliers.Adjusted gross profit of $26 million in the third quarter of 2025 was 61% higher than the same period in 2024. This was largely due to the lower inventory cost adjustments in the current quarter  as well as a compensation payment of $5 million for an equipment failure related to our growth investment in Zanesville.SG&A expenses of $17 million in the third quarter of 2025 were 25% higher than in the third quarter of 2024  largely driven by higher professional fees and additional personnel in the current period relating to the chrome expansion project.The third quarter of 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $19 million was 81% higher than the same period in 2024. This increase was primarily due to the higher sales prices noted above as well as the Zanesville compensation payment of $5 million.AMG TechnologiesQ3 ‘25 Q3 ‘24 Change Revenue $247 992 $156 431 59% Adjusted gross profit 58 615 34 911 68% Operating profit 36 252 13 968 160% Adjusted EBITDA 41 235 19 255 114%AMG Technologies' third quarter 2025 revenue increased by $92 million  or 59%  compared to the same period in 2024. This improvement was driven largely by higher antimony sales prices in the current quarter as well as by strong sales in Engineering of turbine blade coating furnaces.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2025 of $25 million were 14% higher than in the third quarter of 2024. This was due to additional personnel at AMG LIVA and AMG Engineering corresponding to the increased business development within those units  as well as higher personnel costs at AMG Antimony related to that unit’s increased sales activity.AMG Technologies’ adjusted EBITDA was $41 million during the third quarter  more than double the $19 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was due to higher profitability in AMG Antimony and AMG Engineering.AMG Engineering signed $87 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2025  representing a 0.92x book to bill ratio  mainly driven by strong orders of induction furnaces. AMG Engineering achieved an order backlog of $402 million as of September 30  2025.AMG Silicon’s operations continue to be halted due to high energy prices in Germany and unfavorable markets. Due to this situation  the profitability of the business is immaterial and excluded from adjusted EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $7 million in the third quarter of 2025  compared to $2 million in the same period in 2024. The tax expense in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by strong profitability in the quarter as well as tax expense from unabsorbed losses  partially offset by a Brazilian deferred tax benefit related to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real.Cash tax payments totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2025  compared to $5 million in the third quarter or 2024. The decrease reflects a timing difference in tax settlements  with 2025 payments primarily attributable to the continued strong performance of AMG Antimony in France.Exceptional Items - Adjusted Gross ProfitAMG’s third quarter 2025 and 2024 adjusted gross profit includes exceptional items  which are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA as shown in the summary below:Exceptional items included in adjusted gross profitQ3 ‘25 Q3 ‘24 Change Gross profit $89 976 $46 098 95% Inventory cost adjustment 414 18 258 (98%) Restructuring expense 751 102 636% Silicon’s partial closure (2 684) (1 224) 119% Other (460) 441 N/A Adjusted gross profit 87 997 63 675 38%AMG had a $3 million expense during the third quarter of 2025 related to AMG Silicon’s partial closure  which has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted gross profit.SG&AAMG’s third quarter 2025 SG&A expenses of $56 million were 18% higher than in the third quarter of 2024. This variance was primarily driven by the increase in headcount in our Lithium  Chrome  Engineering  and LIVA businesses associated with our strategic expansion projects  higher personnel costs at AMG Antimony related to that unit’s increased sales activity  and higher professional fees.LiquiditySeptember 30  2025 December 31  2024 Change Senior secured debt $430 201 $431 960 —% Cash & cash equivalents 219 701 294 254 (25%) Senior secured net debt 210 500 137 706 53% Other debt 16 287 13 124 24% Net debt excluding municipal bond 226 787 150 830 50% Municipal bond debt 318 549 318 747 —% Restricted cash 1 591 1 523 4% Net debt 543 745 468 054 16%AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the third quarter. As of September 30  2025  the Company had $220 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $199 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $419 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2025. In July  to preserve our liquidity and reduce refinancing risk  AMG executed a maturity extension on our $200 million revolving credit facility. The revolver maturity date was extended from November 2026 to August 2028 with terms similar to the original agreement. Our term loan maturity date of November 2028 remains unchanged.Net Finance CostsAMG’s third quarter 2025 net finance cost was $14 million  compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2024  due to a decrease in interest income as well as increased quarter over quarter non-cash intercompany foreign exchange losses from a weaker EUR/USD exchange rate.OutlookThe AMG Technologies segment continues to perform particularly well  driven by a very high order backlog in AMG Engineering and by high profitability in AMG Antimony. We update our estimate for the temporary tailwind from selling low-priced antimony inventories from more than $50 million to more than $70 million for the full year 2025. Based on that  we increase our adjusted EBITDA outlook from “200 million  or more” to “$220 million  or more  in 2025.”Profit (loss) for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ3 ‘25 Q3 ‘24 Profit (loss) for the period $13 747 ($11 708) Income tax expense 7 148 1 676 Net finance cost 14 365 7 813 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 506 1 524 Restructuring expense 751 102 Inventory cost adjustment 414 18 258 Strategic project expense (1) 11 351 7 127 Others (2 400) 616 EBIT 46 882 25 408 Depreciation and amortization 16 740 14 858 Adjusted EBITDA 63 622 40 266Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including the joint venture with Shell  the LIVA Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

(+16.7% to €11.0m)  fuelled by the addition of 213 new pharmacy customers since the start of the year (1 600 at 30 September) and a sharp rise in revenue from solutions for pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors.In Germany  growth was robust (+15.4% to €4.6m)  particularly with Pharmagest Germany expanding its range— especially hardware offerings —through shared Group solutions.In Belgium  the return to growth was confirmed (+10.2% to €1.9m) with the addition of a new network of 88 pharmacies to the customer base.The AXIGATE LINK Division reported revenue of €25.3m at 30 September 2025 (+12.2% on a reported basis and +8.5% like-for-like) and €8.9m in Q3 (+23.8% on a reported basis and +12.2% like-for-like).The Nursing Home sector (+3.9% to €12.5m) continued to perform well  particularly in France with the Health and Social Care Facilities Solutions Digital Programme (ESMS Numérique) funding  and in the UK with the start of TitanLink’s rollout across four facilities.The Home Care sector (+21.4% to €5.8m) maintained strong momentum by continuing to rapidly add new customers and securing the first contract for its new offer dedicated to Home Care Services.The Hospital segment (+47.1% to €4.0m) was strengthened by the acquisition of the ResUrgences software solution and additional modules dedicated to hospital financial and management functions (DIS).These newly consolidated entities contributed €0.8m to quarterly revenue. Like-for-like growth remained strong (+16.3%)  supported by new contracts with hospital groups.The E-CONNECT Division reported revenue of €11.4m at 30 September 2025 (+37.2%) and €3.9m in Q3 (+38.3%).In line with first-half trends  the Division maintained a strong pace in deploying its Mobility solutions with software publishers.The strategy to secure and stabilise the French production chain ensured high industrial capacity over the summer period  preventing any slowdown in market supply.The rollout of its electronic health insurance card readers (Apps Vitale  the digital version of the French health insurance card on smartphones) has been gradually underway since March 2025; however  progress depends directly on the French Health Insurance’s schedule  over which the Group has limited visibility.The MEDICAL SOLUTIONS Division reported revenue of €7.4m at 30 September (+28.8% on a reported basis and +1.4% like-for-like) and €2.3m in Q3 (+28.2% on a reported basis and –0.6% like-for-like).The Division’s revenue growth was mainly attributable to the strategic acquisition of Calimed  whose SaaS solution  enhanced with the Group’s latest innovations  will serve as a future growth driver.The Division’s legacy solutions  MédiStory and MédiLink  were enhanced with new offerings  including the LOQUii voice-based AI assistant  but the shift to a recurring-revenue business model now implemented across the Division has led to only moderate revenue growth.The FINTECH Division reported revenue of €1.5m at 30 September 2025 (+0.2%) and €0.5m in Q3 (+20.8%).Activity remained stable  with an improved portfolio quality  but financing market conditions were currently unfavourable.2025 outlookThe Group maintains its guidance for revenue growth of nearly 10% on a reported basis in the second half of 2025.The Group remains on the lookout for external growth opportunities  in particular to round out its service offering  strengthen its distribution networks  and support its continued expansion in Europe.Financial calendar:FY 2025 revenue: 5 February 2026About Equasens GroupFounded over 35 years ago  Equasens Group  a leader in digital healthcare solutions  today employs over 1.300 people across Europe.Equasens Group’s specialised business applications facilitate the day-to-day work of healthcare professionals and their teams  working in private practice  collaborative medical structures or healthcare establishments.

As a result of a joint engineering collaboration between THEON and Shock EO Systems Ltd (ShockEOS) R&D teams over the past 12 months  THEON has received an initial order for several sample units of its newly developed stabilized multi-sensor platform optronics system from a European Defense Prime. These samples will be used for the full qualification of the system on a remote weapon system over the coming months  at the end of which an extensively large order for serial production is expected to be placed.Theon was selected by the Defense Prime based on its established Design and Development capabilities  as well as production readiness and price competitiveness. This first success of THEON in the stabilized multi-sensor platform optronics segment comes much earlier than internally expected  with first orders originally anticipated towards the end of 2026. This is the result of THEON’s investments in accelerating its entry into the segment by enlarging its own R&D team over the past 18 months  collaborating closely with ShockEOS  as well as its recent acquisition of Kappa (pending final regulatory approvals).Following this demonstrated success with ShockEOS  and to support further acceleration into the segment  THEON is now acquiring 30% of ShockEOS  subject to customary closing conditions  with an option to reach majority within the next 24 months.Founded in 2023 and built around an engineering team with more than 15 years of electro-optic engineering experience  ShockEOS has evolved into a world-class design and engineering partner for the global Aerospace and Defense sector.Philippe Mennicken  Deputy CEO and Business Development Director at THEON commented: ""Today's announcement represents another notable milestone in our key strategic initiative of rapidly and methodically broadening our product portfolio and significantly increasing our total addressable market. The platform optronics segment represents a much bigger segment than man-portable in which THEON sees many business opportunities. We have been working closely with ShockEOS for over 12 months and are delighted to have secured this initial order as a result. We see considerable demand for such type of product especially in Europe and the Middle East and look forward to securing further orders and welcoming ShockEOS's highly experienced team to THEON Group.""Klearchos Sarikakis  Director of R&D at THEON  added: ""We are pleased with the initial achievement resulting from the joint development efforts between THEON’s R&D Platform division and ShockEOS. Our effective collaboration demonstrated their professionalism  responsiveness  and expertise  making us confident that both companies share similar DNA. Consequently  our recommendation to move forward with THEON's investment in ShockEOS was promptly accepted and approved by the Management of both companies.”Kobus Coetzee  Founder and CTO of ShockEOS remarked: “We are thrilled that  after intense collaboration between our teams in Greece and South Africa  we have reached this significant milestone and secured our first order. We are proud to now be part of THEON’s family. Our cooperation exceeded our expectations and we feel very strong that the two companies together can be the next big thing in the Platform Electro-optics market”.For inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

Our growth drivers in energy services and in Germany continue to perform strongly  fiber roll-out activities in Belgium are resuming  and Italy shows positive momentum  while we are progressing swiftly with the rationalization of our operations in Spain and the United Kingdom. In our French telecoms activities  we have accelerated our adaptation efforts to deeply transform our operating model so as to align with new market realities. This transformation is a necessary step to restore a level of profitability in line with our ambitions. Recent distinctions received from Ecovadis and Ethifinance reflect the progress we have made in terms of ESG performance. They are a reward for our teams’ commitment and strengthen our determination to place sustainability at the core of our strategy.”Consolidated RevenueSolutions30’s consolidated revenue amounted to €216.8 million in the third quarter of 2025  a limited decrease of -3.9% compared to the same quarter in 2024. This quarter confirms the trend of sequential easing in the revenue decline observed since the beginning of the year  following decreases of -12.3% in the first quarter and -6.7% in the second quarter. The change in revenue for the third quarter includes an organic contraction of-6.1%  partially offset by a +2.1% contribution from recent acquisitions. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is negligible.The change in revenue reflects the significant decline in telecommunications (Connectivity) activities in France  adversely impacted by the very rapid slowdown in fiber roll-outs  as well as by the selectivity measures implemented by the Group in 2024. Excluding these activities  Group revenue increased by +3.4% in the third quarter  notably driven by strong growth in Energy services in France (+47.5%)  continued development in Germany (+10.1%)  and the resumption of fiber activities in Belgium.In millions of euros Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Change Connectivity France revenue 31.1 45.8 (32.1%) Group revenue excluding Connectivity France 185.6 179.6 +3.4% Group revenue 216.8 225.4 (3.9%) In millions of euros 9m 2025 9m 2024 Change Connectivity France revenue 102.3 165.5 (38.2%) Group revenue excluding Connectivity France 581.9 577.2 +0.8% Group revenue 684.2 742.6 (7.9%)Revenue from Connectivity activities for the quarter amounted to €146.1 million at Group level  a decrease of-10.3%  mainly concentrated in France. Revenue from Energy activities amounted to €47.6 million  up +30.8%  driven by very favorable market trends. Finally  revenue from Technology activities was €23.1 million  down by -12.0% due to a high comparison basis linked to the 2024 Paris Olympics  which created a spike in activity levels.For the first nine months of 2025  consolidated revenue amounted to €684.2 million  compared to €742.6 million for the same period in 2024  a decrease of -7.9%. This includes an organic contraction of -9.3%  a +1.3% impact from acquisitions  and a +0.1% favorable exchange rate effect.BeneluxRevenue generated in Benelux in the third quarter amounted to €80.6 million  or 37% of Group revenue. It was slightly down  by -1.9%  compared to the same period in 2024  following a -7.8% contraction in the first half of the year.Connectivity activities generated revenue of €60.6 million  broadly stable (-1.1%) compared to the third quarter of 2024. After more than a year of being significantly slowed down due to negotiations between Belgian telecom service providers  aimed at mutualizing their investments  fiber roll-out activities in Belgium are now in a recovery phase. September was particularly dynamic  with growth of +8% in the Belgian Connectivity activity  and the ramp-up is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.Energy activities generated revenue of €15.0 million  down -5.2%  reflecting the maturity reached in smart meter rollout programmes  while services related to power grids and electric vehicle charging infrastructure are gradually expanding.Revenue from Technology activities came in at €5.0 million  broadly stable  and includes a first project in the field of railway signaling.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue in Benelux amounted to €262.0 million  representing a purely organic decline of -6.0%.FranceIn France  third-quarter revenue amounted to €73.3 million  or 34% of Group revenue  down -10.3%. This change reflects an organic contraction of -16.2%  partially offset by a +5.9% contribution from acquisitions  following the full consolidation of So-Tec after the Group increased its ownership stake in the company (see press release dated May 12  2025).Revenue from Connectivity activities decreased by -32.1% to €31.1 million. This decline was driven both by the ongoing impact of the selectivity measures implemented in 2024  and by the structural and rapid decline currently affecting the fiber roll-out market. In this context  since the second quarter  the Group is engaged in a comprehensive transformation of its operating model in this business  with the aim of adapting it to the evolving needs of its clients and restoring its profitability.Energy activities continued their strong growth trajectory  posting an increase of +47.5% in the third quarter  including the impact of So-Tec’s full consolidation. Revenue stood at €27.4 million  making up 37% of Solutions30’s revenue in France. Positive momentum in the photovoltaic sector has continued to build  quarter after quarter.Revenue from Technology activities amounted to €14.8 million  a decrease of -14.6%  due to an unfavorable comparison basis effect from the 2024 Paris Olympics  which generated a spike in activity in the third quarter of 2024.In France  revenue for the first nine months of the year amounted to €227.6 million  down -15.8%. This change reflects an organic contraction of -19.2%  partially offset by +3.5% contribution from external growth.GermanyIn the third quarter  Solutions30’s revenue in Germany amounted to €24.0 million  representing 11% of Group revenue  with a purely organic increase of +10.1%. This growth was driven by Connectivity activities  which account for 95% of total revenue in Germany. It reflects a more demanding comparison basis than in previous quarters  as fiber activities ramped up significantly starting in Q3 2024. It also reflects a more uneven pace of deployment operations at present  and a greater priority being given by operators to home connect phases. In this context  Solutions30 benefits from several key strengths: proven operational flexibility  customer base diversification  and its presence across the entire value chain (deployments  connections  maintenance).Energy activities (5% of total revenue) continue to develop  with the signing of initial B2B partnerships in the solar farm installation field.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue generated in Germany amounted to €71.3 million  up by +18.7%.Other CountriesIn the Other Countries segment  Solutions30 recorded revenue of €38.9 million in the third quarter  representing a slight decrease of -2.3%. This change includes an organic decline of -2.7% and a +0.4% contribution from external growth. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is negligible.In Italy  revenue rose sharply by +22.3%  to €15.6 million  driven by strong momentum in fiber activities and the gradual roll-out of operations in the energy sector. The latter is benefitting from the ramp-up of the partnership signed with Spirii  a subsidiary of Edenred (see press release dated June 4  2025).In Poland  revenue increased by +2.3%  reaching €14.8 million. It includes the contribution of Elektra Realizacje  a company specializing in the modernization of low- and medium-voltage electrical networks  in which the Group acquired a majority stake during the third quarter. This transaction marks a first step towards diversification into energy services in Poland  in line with the Group’s strategy  following several years of sustained growth in telecommunications.In Spain  the Group continues to implement its plan to refocus on Energy and Technology activities. Third-quarter revenue amounted to €5.4 million  down -26.2%. A process has begun to divest nearly all the operational assets of the Connectivity business  and an offer has already been received. If completed  this transaction would have no significant impact on the Group’s financial position and would lead to an improvement in margins in Spain.Finally  in the United Kingdom  revenue amounted to €3.0 million  a decrease of -42.1%. In light of recent developments in the fiber market  and in line with the selectivity strategy implemented by the Group  Solutions30 has initiated a process to withdraw from the UK market. This withdrawal is expected to have no significant impact on the Group’s cash position.Over the first nine months of the year  Other Countries posted revenue of €123.3 million  down by -7.8%.Solutions30 receives the highest ESG ratings from EcoVadis and EthifinanceAs part of its ongoing efforts to continuously improve its CSR performance  Solutions30 recently received its highest ratings to date. According to the 2025 EcoVadis score  Solutions30 achieved the highest result in its history  rising from 64 to 80 points out of 100. The Group now ranks among the top 3% of companies worldwide in terms of ESG performance and has been awarded a gold medal. Following a new assessment by Ethifinance  the Group received a score of 86 out of 100 and was awarded a platinum medal  the highest distinction granted by the agency.These recognitions reflect the Group’s concrete commitments  particularly in reducing its carbon footprint  enhancing non-financial transparency  promoting diversity  and upholding the highest social and environmental standards within its supply chain.Upcoming Events2025 Annual Results: March 30  2026About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

I am pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance.”Nine Months to September 30  2025Nine months revenues increased 5% in reporting currency  partly reflecting a 2% impact from currency translation following the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro (average €/$ 1.12 in 9M 2025 vs €/$ 1.09 in 9M 2024). In constant currencies  revenues increased 7%  including the net effect of acquisitions and divestments. Organic growth was 6% (9M 2024: 6%) following a modest pick-up in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year.Recurring revenues (84% of total revenues) sustained 7% organic growth (9M 2024: 7%)  while non-recurring revenues declined 2% (9M 2024: 2% growth). Within recurring revenues  cloud software revenues grew 15% organically (9M 2024: 16%). The 2% decline in non-recurring revenues (16% of total revenues) was mainly caused by expected declines in print books  professional services  and on-premise software licenses  combined with slower growth in transactional revenues.Revenues from North America (63% of total) grew 5% organically (9M 2024: 6%) while revenues from Europe (29% of total) grew 6% (9M 2024: 5%). Asia Pacific & ROW (8% of total) grew 6% organically (9M 2024: 7%).Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 15% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin improved  driven by Health  Tax & Accounting  and Legal & Regulatory. Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  increased. Product development spend (CapEx + OpEx) for the nine months approached 11% of revenues.Health: Nine-months revenues increased 4% in constant currencies  partly reflecting the 2024 divestment of LDI.

Excluding print  organic growth was 6% (9M 2024: 7%).Clinical Solutions delivered 7% organic growth (9M 2024: 8%)  reflecting good renewals for UpToDate clinical decision support and successful cross-selling of our drug data solutions. In October  we launched UpToDate Expert AI  adding a fast  reliable  conversational interface to our trusted medical content. In just a few weeks  over 50 of our health system customers have signed up for enterprise-wide deployments of UpToDate Expert AI. Individual physicians are now able to upgrade to the Expert AI-powered UpToDate Pro Plus version. We continued to expand our partnerships  creating opportunities to extend our customer offerings. Ambient medical scribe providers partnering with UpToDate (e.g. Abridge) are seeing strong adoption of their tools.Learning  Research & Practice recorded 2% organic growth (9M 2024: 3%)  with good organic growth in digital subscriptions and open access revenues partly offset by declines in print formats and non-recurring revenues. Excluding print  the unit’s organic growth would have been 5% (9M 2024: 5%).Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 9% in constant currencies  including the effect of the 2024 acquisition of Isabel Group assets. Organic growth was 7% (9M 2024: 7%) following a pick-up in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. Recurring cloud software revenues recorded double-digit organic growth in North America and Europe.Tax & Accounting North America delivered 7% organic growth (9M 2024: 7%) with strong double-digit organic growth in our cloud-native software suite  CCH Axcess. The strength of CCH Axcess was partly offset by declines in outsourced professional services and print books. In October  we introduced transformative  Expert AI-powered innovations that integrate seamlessly into our cloud platform and provide significant productivity benefits  including CCH Axcess Intelligence; CCH Axcess Client Collaboration; CCH Axcess Scan (K-1 processing); CCH Axcess Advisor; CCH Axcess Workflow  and an agentic audit experience for CCH Axcess Engagement.Tax & Accounting Europe also sustained 7% organic growth (9M 2024: 7%) with solid performance across all regions. The cloud-based financial workflow solutions acquired from Isabel Group in September 2024 achieved double-digit revenue growth in their first nine months with Wolters Kluwer (not included in organic growth until fourth quarter 2025) and position the business to offer end-to-end coverage of our customers’ workflow from pre-accounting to post-accounting.Financial & Corporate Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 7% in constant currencies  reflecting the initial contribution from the RASI acquisition. Organic growth was 4% (9M 2024: 5% pro forma1). Recurring revenues (68% of division total) sustained 6% organic growth (9M 2024: 6% pro forma1) while transactional and other non-recurring revenues were flat (9M 2024: 2% growth pro forma1).Legal Services grew 6% organically (9M 2024: 7%)  as strong growth in recurring subscription revenues was offset by a year-on-year slowdown in transactional revenues. RASI  acquired March 13  2025  achieved better-than-expected  high single-digit revenue growth (not included in organic growth) and expands our position in the mid-size U.S. corporate market for legal services.Financial Services recorded 1% organic growth (9M 2024: 2% pro forma1) as organic growth in recurring revenues was partly offset by declines in lien transactions and other non-recurring revenues. The divestment of Finance  Risk & Regulatory Reporting (FRR)  announced in July 2025  is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues grew 7% in constant currencies  including an initial contribution from Brightflag. Organic growth was 6% (9M 2024: 5%).Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions grew 6% organically (9M 2024: 5%)  reflecting 8% organic growth in our digital research platforms. In Germany  print and other formats benefitted from the effect of 2025 federal elections. Throughout the year  we launched several GenAI-enabled features across our platforms  including the next generation of VitalLaw  which extends the platform beyond research into legal workflows such as creating drafts  memos  checklists  and other deliverables.The software businesses grew 4% organically (9M 2024: 7%)  led by legal practice management tools. ELM Solutions recorded low single-digit organic growth  supported by legal spend volumes. TyMetrix was enhanced with GenAI-powered matter summarization. Brightflag  acquired on June 11  2025  performed ahead of plan with strong double-digit revenue growth in its first few months and is providing a strong entry into the mid-sized corporate market.Corporate Performance & ESG: Nine-month revenues increased 8% in constant currencies. On an organic basis  revenues increased 8% (9M 2024: 9% pro forma1). Recurring revenues (75% of divisional revenues) grew 13% organically  driven by cloud software (SaaS) revenues which grew 17% organically (9M 2024: 20% pro forma1). Non-recurring revenues  comprised of implementation services and on-premise software license fees  declined 5% (9M 2024: 1% decline pro forma1)  as demand shifts to SaaS solutions.Our EHS & ESG 2 solutions (Enablon) delivered 10% organic growth (9M 2024: 14%)  with strong organic growth in cloud software partly offset by lower on-premise licenses and services.solutions (Enablon) delivered 10% organic growth (9M 2024: 14%)  with strong organic growth in cloud software partly offset by lower on-premise licenses and services.

Internal audit solution TeamMate sustained robust single-digit organic growth for the nine-month period.Corporate: Corporate costs increased in constant currencies mainly due to higher personnel costs and personnel-related expenses and brand investments.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow increased 18% overall and 21% in constant currencies  partly reflecting favorable timing of working capital movements. Nine-month adjusted free cash flow increased 14% overall and 17% in constant currencies. Total gross dividends paid to shareholders in the first nine months amounted to €531 million  comprising the 2024 final dividend and the 2025 interim dividend (withholding tax to be paid in October 2025). Share repurchases amounted to €788 million in the first nine months.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €839 million in the first nine months  mainly relating to the acquisitions of Registered Agent Solutions (RASI) on March 13  2025  and Brightflag on June 11  2025.As of September 30  2025  net debt was €4 404 million (year-end 2024: €3 134 million)  reflecting cash flow allocated to dividends  share repurchases  and acquisitions. Twelve months’ rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x compared to 2.1x as of June 30  2025 (year-end 2024: 1.6x).Sustainability UpdateDuring 2025  we have been focused on helping employees to build skills  strengthen workplace connections  and align with our mission. Key 2025 initiatives include a Work from Anywhere program  offering employees greater flexibility in how and where they work. In the third quarter  all employees were invited to participate in our annual Engagement & Belonging survey. We also rolled out our Annual Compliance Training  which covers cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  over 99% of employees globally have completed the exercise. Our workforce turnover rate was stable at 10% (9M 2024: 10%) with voluntary turnover at 7% (9M 2024: 7%).We achieved a 7% organic reduction3 in office space (square meters) in the first nine months of 2025  contributing to our efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.Share Cancellation 2025On September 19  2025  we cancelled 6.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2025. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is now 232 516 153. Of this  229.1 million shares were outstanding and 3.4 million shares were held in treasury as of September 30  2025.Share Buyback Programs 2025-2026In February 2025  we announced a 2025 share buyback program of up to €1 billion. The 2025 program was completed on November 3  2025  two months earlier than originally planned. This followed the decision  announced on September 17  2025  to accelerate repurchases in view of the development in the share price.We have now signed a new mandate to repurchase up to €200 million in shares over the four months from November 6  2025  up to February 23  2026. With this action  we are bringing forward part of an intended buyback program for 2026  the details of which will be announced on February 25  2026.We continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with sufficient headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Full-Year 2025 OutlookOur full-year 2025 outlook is unchanged. We continue to expect full-year 2025 organic growth to be broadly in line with the prior year. Despite the adverse USD exchange rate movement  the absence of last year’s pension gain  and additional restructuring  we continue to expect the adjusted operating profit margin in reported currency to be near the top end of our guidance range  supported by most divisions.Performance indicators 2025 Guidance 2024 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 27.1%-27.5% 27.1% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 250-€1 300 million €1 276 million ROIC* ±18% 18.1% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid- to high-single-digit growth 11%*Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2025 of €/$ 1.13. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of up to €1.1 billion in 2025.In 2024  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2024 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 4.5 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS. If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a negative effect on results reported in euros for the remainder of this year.Restructuring costs are included in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2025 restructuring costs to be in the range of €20-35 million (FY 2024: €28 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs4 in constant currencies to increase to approximately €95-100 million. We continue to expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to rise within the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2024: 23.1%). Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2024: 5.3%). We continue to expect the full-year 2025 cash conversion ratio to be within 95%-100% (FY 2024: 102%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations  apart from acquisitions or divestitures already completed. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2025 outlook by divisionOur guidance for full-year 2025 organic revenue growth by division is unchanged:Health: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with or slightly below prior year (FY 2024: 6%).Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2024: 7%).Financial & Corporate Compliance: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be below prior year (FY 2024: 5% pro forma1)  due to weaker transactional revenues and suspension of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA).Legal Regulatory: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2024: 5%).Corporate Performance & ESG: we continue to expect FY 2025 organic growth to be above prior year (FY 2024: 6% pro forma1) reflecting higher growth for the CCH Tagetik CPM platform.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information solutions  software and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.
