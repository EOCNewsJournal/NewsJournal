Adjusted EPS (basic) was €1.68 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €1.64.

This forecast largely reflects the expected decrease in volumes of SCR tanks and is further compounded by an unfavorable outlook across all product lines: the cancellation  postponement or significantly delayed commencement of several programs related to the production of electric vehicles.

The negative impact of foreign exchange rates reached -€4.4M this quarter  mainly due to the US dollar. In the first 9 months of 2025  revenue at constant scope and exchange rates decreased by -3.0%.ANALYSIS OF REVENUE DISTRIBUTIONThe cumulative turnover for the first nine months is distributed by geographic production area as follows:EMEA (Europe  Middle East  Africa): €491.3M (-1.6%)America: €214.8M (-6.7%)Asia: €24.6M (-13.6%)Revenue for Products and Functions fell by -1.4% to €712.6M over the period. The Cooling (+1.6%)  Decontamination (+7.0%)  Fuel (+5.1%) and Oil (+5.7%) product lines exhibited growth  while other lines  including Air (-19.1%)  Mechanisms (-4.7%) and Control (-5.5%)  remained on a downward trend. Tools recorded revenue of €11.0M.NET CASH POSITION OF €168.9MConsolidated net cash excluding the impact of lease liabilities amounted to €168.9M on September 30  2025 (before disbursement of the €8.0M dividend on October 7). This represents an increase of €19.6M compared to June 30  with an investment envelope of €8.4M this quarter  which is comparable to previous quarters.PROSPECTSWhen publishing its half-year results  the Group indicated that it anticipated a decline in activity for 2025 that was lower than that of the previous year  bolstered by the postponement to 2026 of the production shutdown of SCR tanks.However  AKWEL's business prospects for the coming year are more pessimistic at this point. Having concluded its budgetary process  the Group now anticipates a double-digit decline in its consolidated revenue for 2026. This forecast largely reflects the expected decrease in volumes of SCR tanks  which has already been communicated. It is further compounded by an unfavorable outlook across all product lines: the cancellation  postponement or significantly delayed commencement of several programs related to the production of electric vehicles both in Europe and in the United States. Additionally  there is a lesser impact from the discontinuation of some fluid and mechanism programs for vehicles with internal combustion engines—particularly diesel vehicles—as well as setbacks encountered with hydrogen engines.Beyond the ongoing and planned transition of its Decontamination activity  in 2026 AKWEL will face the high inertia and uncertainties encountered by most vehicle and parts manufacturers. These include depressed markets and slow progress in electric vehicle development—particularly in mature economies—restrictive or unclear customs practices  pressure from Chinese competitors  and the need to adapt and control costs in a context of constrained volumes  in order to best preserve operating profit.Next press release: 2025 annual revenue  February 5  2026  after markets close.An independent family business  trading on Euronext Paris  AKWEL is a parts and systems manufacturer for the automotive and heavy-vehicle industry  and a specialist in fluid management  mechanisms and structural parts for electric vehicles.

The generative AI contemplated in the contract will allow the development of an ecosystem of artificial intelligence agents capable of helping citizens to solve their needs from the Madrid City Council.Continuous evolution of the systemThe contract  with a duration of three years and the possibility of extension for an additional year  includes the corrective  adaptive and evolutionary maintenance of the different services that operate on the AI platform of the Madrid City Council  as well as operational support to users and the Computer and Communications Service of the Madrid City Council (Easydro).In close collaboration with the Madrid City Council  Atos will promote excellence and collaboration in the use of AI through technological surveillance  an innovation laboratory  a knowledge network  specialized trainings and technical and methodological support for the design and monitoring of artificial intelligence projects.In addition  Atos will develop new use cases and enhancements to the municipal AI platform  while resolving incidents and adapting AI systems to technical or regulatory changes  offering support for both day-to-day operations and end-users.New use cases and practical applicationsAmong the many use cases that Atos is developing  examples such as Clear Communication and Pipeline of documentary objects (text  audio  video) stand out  which highlight the potential of AI in public management.Clear Communication aims to improve the writing and understanding of administrative texts  ensuring that they are clear  accessible and understandable for citizens  in accordance with the Madrid City Council's Clear Communication Guide. Thanks to advanced language models  the system can analyze the context  suggest reformulations and justify the proposed changes  thus strengthening transparency  efficiency and linguistic equity.On the other hand  Pipeline of Documentary Objects allows the automatic processing of audio  video and text files  transforming their content into structured information through transcription and OCR  and generating vector representations (embeddings) that facilitate semantic searches and contextual queries. This capability accelerates the localization of relevant information and enables the integration of surge recovery (Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG) systems to deliver accurate and contextualized responses.José Miguel González Aguilera  Deputy Director General of Innovation and Emerging Services of the Madrid City Council  said: ""At the Madrid City Council we work to improve the daily lives of the people of Madrid. We believe that the use of Artificial Intelligence in municipal services represents a unique opportunity for transformation in the way of relating to and providing services to citizens. This project with Atos is a firm step towards an effective and efficient digital transformation.""Diego Padilla  Project Manager at Atos  added: ""This contract reinforces our commitment to the development of trustworthy  ethical and useful artificial intelligence for citizens. At Atos we put our experience and technological capabilities at the service of a more agile  efficient and citizen-oriented administration.”###About Atos GroupAtos Group is a global leader in digital transformation with c. 67 000 employees and annual revenue of c. €10 billion  operating in 61 countries under two brands — Atos for services and Eviden for products.

Presents Phase 2 Kidney Function and Biomarker Data at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2025Compelling kidney function data from VIVIAD Phase 2b study presented in late-breaking poster at ASN kidney week  the world’s premier nephrology meetingVIVIAD analyses continue to support varoglutamstat’s potential in kidney disease  and consistently provide further evidence for a beneficial impact on kidney function based on its proposed mechanism of actionHalle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  November 6  2025 - Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced the presentation of clinical study data from the Company’s lead investigational medicine in development  varoglutamstat  in a late-breaking poster today  November 6  2025  at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025 in Houston  Texas.The poster titled “Correlation of eGFR and pE-CCL2 in Older Adult Patients Treated with Varoglutamstat: Data from VIVIAD  a Phase 2B Randomized Clinical Trial” featured Phase 2 clinical study data underscoring varoglutamstat’s unique ability to stabilize and even improve kidney function  as measured by eGFR values.Results from Vivoryon’s VIVIAD Phase 2b study previously showed that reduction of the anti-inflammatory biomarker pE-CCL2 was associated with an improvement of kidney function as measured by eGFR in study participants with and without diabetes at a dose group level. In line with these results  the poster highlights further analyses of total population data from the VIVIAD study evaluating the correlation of pE-CCL2 levels and eGFR slope on an individual participant level  which revealed a statistically significant correlation between the change from baseline in pE-CCL2 serum levels at week 48 and the eGFR slope over time. Specifically  a decrease in pE-CCL2 was significantly correlated with a positive (improved) eGFR slope.“We are truly grateful for the opportunity to share our consistently compelling results with world leading scientific and medical experts in the kidney field at ASN Kidney week  considered to be the world’s premier nephrology congress ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Inflammation is known to be a key driver in diabetic kidney disease and our data to date show clearly that inhibition of glutaminyl-cyclases with varoglutamstat is a promising new approach to treat diabetic kidney disease and other chronic diseases of the kidney. Every step forward strengthens our belief that  with varoglutamstat  we have a unique opportunity to develop a game-changing medicine with the potential to go beyond current standard of care and meaningfully improve kidney function in people with kidney disease.”Vivoryon is planning to confirm the previously reported compelling data from its two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a dedicated Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stage 3b/4. Initiation of the Phase 2b and all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.###About VIVIAD / MethodsVIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a randomized clinical trial (Phase 2b) in 259 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease treated with 300 or 600 mg varoglutamstat  or placebo  BID for 48-96 weeks. Measurement of eGFR and biomarkers of inflammation were prospectively defined. pE-CCL2 serum levels were measured at baseline and at week 48 with an ELISA. Individual patient slopes of eGFR (MDRD formula) were calculated using random-coefficient analysis. Spearman correlations were calculated with R.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines for the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders of the kidney. Driven by its passion for ground-breaking science and innovation  the Company strives to improve patient outcomes by changing the course of severe diseases through modulating the activity and stability of pathologically relevant proteins.

Financial information and comments are therefore based on these alternative performance measures  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2025  the impact of IFRS 11 on our revenue as defined in APM was -€70.3 million (-€76.1 million in Q3 2024)  leaving IFRS revenue at €855.8 million (€872.0 million in Q3 2024).For the first nine months of 2025  the impact of IFRS 11 on revenue was -€205.9 million (-€217.1 million for the first nine months of 2024)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 588.5 million (€2 538.7 million for the first nine months of 2024).Definitions notesRevenue: It includes on proportional basis the revenue of the companies under joint control. Organic growth: The Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.Organic revenue growth€mQ1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M2024 revenue (a) 801.6 1 006.1 1 807.6 948.2 2 755.82025 IFRS revenue (b) 797.7 935.0 1 732.7 855.8 2 588.5 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 60.3 75.3 135.6 70.3 205.9 2025 revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 858.0 1 010.3 1 868.3 926.1 2 794.4 Currency impacts (e) -1.5 24.2 22.7 27.6 50.3 2025 revenue at 2024 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 856.5 1 034.5 1 891.0 953.7 2 844.7 Change in scope (g) -11.0 -12.5 -23.5 -14.1 -37.6 2025 organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 845.5 1 022.0 1 867.5 939.6 2 807.2Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.5% +1.6% +3.3% -0.9% +1.9%€m Impact of currencyas of Sept. 30th  2025AUD 11.1 BRL 9.7 USD 6.2 CNY 5.2 Others 18.1Total 50.3Average exchange rate 9M 2025 9M 2024AUD 0.5732 0.6091 BRL 0.1583 0.1757 USD 0.8938 0.9199 CNY 0.1238 0.1278Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.42,0.27,0.31,True,English,"['Q3 2025 trading update', 'JCDecaux', '2024 Paris Olympic & Paralympic Games comparison base effect', 'unique diversified premium geographic footprint', 'c.410bp comparison base impact', '410bp negative comparison base impact', 'Paris automatic public toilet network', '+7.6% organic digital revenue growth Guidance', 'high comparison base effect', 'c.410bp comparison impact', 'mid-single digit revenue decline', 'Q3 2025 trading update Digital', 'underlying organic revenue growth', 'Robust underlying revenue growth', 'high 2024 comparison base', 'double digit revenue growth', 'Organic growth Street Furniture', 'Jean-François Decaux', 'growing media segment', 'significant non-advertising sales', 'alternative performance measures', 'high single digit', 'low single digit', 'significant non-advertising revenue', 'foreign exchange variations', 'challenging macroeconomic environment', 'UEFA Euro events', '2025 third quarter revenue', 'negative impact', 'robust performance', 'positive impact', 'geographic comments', 'organic basis', 'Q3 revenue', 'total revenue', 'programmatic revenue', 'variations calculations', 'Third-quarter revenue', 'Executive Board', 'substantial increase', 'DOOH revenue', 'North America', 'January 1st', 'prorata share', 'joint control', 'rounded amounts', 'insignificant extent', 'advertising displays', 'press release', 'IFRS figures', 'November', 'expectations', 'Q4', 'Appendices', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'JCDecaux', 'Home', 'terms', 'activity', 'France', 'Rest', 'World', 'Transport', 'Europe', 'China', 'Billboard', 'UK', 'Asia-Pacific', 'account', 'contract', 'improvement', 'adoption', 'APM', 'companies', 'paragraph', 'page', 'definition', 'reconciliation', 'compliance', 'AMF', 'instructions', 'values', 'tables', 'millions', 'euros', 'sum', 'changes', 'perimeter', 'rental', 'maintenance']",2025-11-06,2025-11-07,globenewswire.com

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the three months ended September 30  2025.Chief Executive Officer  Fabrice Chouraqui  commented:“We delivered another strong quarter  with significant growth in revenue and profitability  reinforcing our confidence in the business.We continue to drive the performance of RUCONEST® in the competitive U.S. HAE market  fueled by new patient enrollments and an expanding prescriber base  even amid the launch of a new oral on-demand therapy in July. Joenja® also delivered significant revenue growth  driven by a 25% year-over-year increase in patients on paid therapy and consistently high adherence rates. Looking ahead  we expect continued uptake amongst APDS patients aged 12 and older and new sources of growth including the anticipated pediatric label expansion for patients aged 4 to 11  the reclassification of variants of uncertain significance  or VUSs  and regulatory approvals enabling launches in several major markets.Our pipeline is advancing well  unlocking potential new indications for leniolisib in broader primary immunodeficiency populations and addressing significant unmet needs in primary mitochondrial disease with KL1333.To capitalize on these growth catalysts and pipeline opportunities  we recently announced a significant reduction in general and administrative headcount to optimize capital deployment to high growth initiatives. This disciplined approach combined with strong operating results — US$32 million in third-quarter operating cash flow — reinforces our ability to accelerate Pharming’s development and create value for our stakeholders and shareholders.Based on this strong performance and our outlook for the final quarter of the year  we are raising our full-year revenue guidance.I am pleased to welcome Leverne Marsh as Chief Commercial Officer  effective January 1  2026  succeeding Stephen Toor. Leverne brings a strong track record of high impact launches and deep experience across the commercial spectrum  which will be instrumental as we continue executing our strategy to become a leading global rare disease company. I would like to thank Steve for his contributions to Pharming over the past nine years and for his legacy in building a uniquely patient-focused culture.I want to thank our teams for their dedication and resilience in driving our mission forward.”Third quarter highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksStrong RUCONEST® growth continued in the third quarter of 2025  with revenue of US$82.2 million  a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was US$231.2 million  a 34% increase compared to the same period in 2024.In the U.S. market  we continued to grow the patient and prescriber base during the quarter  notwithstanding the market entry of a new oral on-demand HAE product in early July. Significant patient growth over the prior year was driven by patients who rely on RUCONEST® for its efficacy  reliability and rapid onset via IV administration. Unit sales volume in the U.S. increased by 24% in the third quarter and 28% in the first nine months.Pharming has made the strategic decision to withdraw RUCONEST® from registration and/or commercialization in all non-US markets. These markets contributed only US$1.1 million  or 1.3% of total RUCONEST® revenue in the current quarter and have never demonstrated financial sustainability. Ensuring continuity of care and minimizing the impact on patients during this transition remain our highest priorities. This decision also enables Pharming to reallocate resources toward pipeline opportunities with greater long-term growth potential.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed for the treatment of APDSJoenja® revenue increased to US$15.1 million in the third quarter of 2025  a 35% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was US$38.4 million  a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Unit sales volume increased by 34% in the third quarter of 2025  driven by a significant increase in patients on paid therapy in the U.S. and the U.K. launch in April 2025.The U.S. market contributed 89% of third quarter revenue  while the EU and Rest of World (RoW) contributed 11%. The significant increase in EU and RoW revenue was primarily driven by strong patient uptake in the U.K.As of September 30  2025  we had 116 patients on paid therapy in the U.S.  representing a 25% increase from the 93 patients at the end of the third quarter of 2024. The number of U.S. patients diagnosed with APDS that we have identified increased by 13 in the third quarter of 2025 and 36 year-to-date.APDS patient findingAs of September 30  2025  we have identified 990 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages globally  including 270 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S.  175 patients are 12 years of age or older and currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®  while 54 are between 4 and 11 years of age and would become eligible pending regulatory approval expected in January 2026.VUS patient reclassificationThere are currently over 1 400 known U.S. patients with a variant of uncertain significance  or VUS  in the PIK3CD and PIK3R1 genes implicated in APDS. We estimate that 20% of VUS patients could ultimately be diagnosed with APDS  thereby expanding the addressable patient population for Joenja®. Genetic testing laboratories are currently evaluating data from a study published in June 2025 in the leading peer-reviewed journal Cell  by researchers at Columbia University  to determine the process and potential to reclassify patients to APDS.Joenja® (leniolisib) developmentLeniolisib for APDSAs of September 30  2025  there are 180 APDS patients in either a leniolisib Expanded Access Program (compassionate use)  an ongoing clinical study  or a named patient program.Pediatric label expansionOn July 31  2025  we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for leniolisib for the treatment of children aged 4 to 11 years diagnosed with APDS. On October 1  2025  we announced that the FDA had accepted the sNDA and granted Priority Review of the application and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of January 31  2026. Assuming a positive decision  we plan a commercial launch for this pediatric age group in the first quarter of 2026.The Phase III clinical trial evaluating a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib in children 1 to 6 years of age diagnosed with APDS completed enrollment in April 2025. We expect to report results from this study in the coming months and if the data are supportive we plan to seek regulatory approval for this younger pediatric population.Organizational updatesOn September 2  2025  we announced the appointment of Kenneth Lynard as Chief Financial Officer  effective October 1  2025  strengthening our financial leadership as we continue to execute on our growth strategy. Mr. Lynard is a seasoned finance executive with over 20 years of global leadership experience in the life sciences industry.On October 6  2025  we announced the implementation of an organizational restructuring aligned with our previously announced plan to reduce general and administrative (G&A) expenses  to optimize capital deployment to our significant growth opportunities. The restructuring includes a 20% net reduction in non-commercial and non-medical headcount  primarily at our Netherlands headquarters. We remain on track to reduce total G&A expenses by 15% or US$10 million annually and anticipate one-time restructuring costs of approximately $7 million to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 in connection with the headcount reduction.We announce today that Ms. Leverne Marsh has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer (CCO)  effective January 1  2026  succeeding Stephen Toor  who will leave on December 31 and remain an advisor to the company. Ms. Marsh brings extensive experience across the commercial landscape  which will be instrumental as we continue executing our strategy to become a leading global rare disease company. At Novartis  she led major specialty care product launches and BD&L transactions in multiple franchise head roles in the US  ultimately serving as Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategy. Most recently  as Executive Vice President  Marketing for Dexcom  a leading medical technology company  Ms. Marsh drove accelerated growth in a fast-paced health tech environment and supported the expansion of the international footprint of the business. Her expertise in leveraging AI and analytics to advance commercial execution  will be a key asset as we advance our mission in rare diseases.Corporate highlightsPharming was promoted from the Euronext AScX® (Small Cap) to the AMX® (MidCap) index  effective from September 22  2025  reflecting our growing market capitalization and trading activity.

RUCONEST® revenues amounted to US$82.2 million  a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase in RUCONEST® revenues was primarily driven by a volume increase in the U.S. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$15.1 million in the third quarter of 2025  a 34% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume.Gross profit increased by US$22.2 million or 33% to US$90.2 million (3Q 2024: US$68.0 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues.The operating profit increased 285% and amounted to US$15.8 million compared to US$4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted to exclude US$0.2 million of non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  the operating profit amounted to US$16.0 million. The improved operating result was primarily driven by an increase in revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses.The net finance result amounted to a loss of US$2.8 million compared to a loss of US$2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. This was primarily driven by lower interest income due to a lower average overall cash position and decreased interest rates.The Company had a net profit of US$7.5 million  compared to a net loss of US$1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. The change was primarily driven by increased revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses.Cash generated from operations amounted to US$32.0 million  compared to US$9.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  increased from US$130.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2025 to US$168.9 million at the end of the third quarter of 2025. This increase was primarily driven by the net cash flows generated from operating activities.Nine months 2025Total revenues increased 32% during the first nine months of 2025 to US$269.6 million  versus US$204.5 million during the first nine months of 2024. Total RUCONEST® revenues were 34% higher at US$231.2 million  compared to revenues of US$172.6 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in RUCONEST® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$38.4 million in the first nine months of 2025  a 20% increase compared to the first nine months of 2024. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume.Gross profit increased by US$63.9 million or 35% to US$245.2 million (9M 2024: US$181.3 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues.The operating profit amounted to US$19.6 million compared to an operating loss of US$15.3 million in the first nine months of 2024. Adjusted to exclude US$10.1 million of non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  of which US$8.0 million is included in General and administrative expenses and US$2.1 million is included in Research and development expenses  the operating profit amounted to US$29.7 million. The improved operating result was primarily driven by an increase in revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses which include a total of US$20.4 million in Abliva-related expenses. Excluding these Abliva-related expenses  operating expenses increased by 4% compared to the first nine months of 2024.The net finance result amounted to a loss of US$11.3 million compared to a gain of US$1.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. This decline was mainly driven by the absence of a one-time fair value gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 following the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity  as well as by unfavorable EUR/USD exchange rate movements in the nine months of 2025.The Company had a net loss of US$2.8 million  compared to a net loss of US$14.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. The change was primarily driven by increased revenues  partially offset by a change in the net finance result and higher operating expenses  including US$10.1 million non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses  most of which are not tax-deductible.Cash generated from operations amounted to US$44.0 million  compared to US$11.1 million used in operations in the first nine months of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased by US$0.5 million to US$168.9 million from US$169.4 million at the end of 2024  primarily driven by purchases of Abliva shares totaling US$68.0 million and non-recurring Abliva acquisition-related expenses totaling US$10.1 million  primarily offset by US$44.0 million of cash generated from operations.Outlook/SummaryFor 2025  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$365 million and US$375 million (23% to 26% growth).Total operating expenses between US$304 million and US$308 million  assuming constant currency  including US$10.2 million non-recurring Abliva-related transaction and integration expenses  but excluding one-time restructuring costs of approximately $7 million to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025.Continued growth of RUCONEST® in the acute HAE market.Significant growth in APDS patients on paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy in the U.S.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues for leniolisib  driven by funded access programs and commercial availability in the U.K.Progress towards additional regulatory approvals for leniolisib for APDS patients 12 years of age or older and for pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Advancing the two ongoing Phase II clinical trials in PIDs with immune dysregulation to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Advancing the ongoing pivotal FALCON clinical study for KL1333 in mitochondrial DNA-driven primary mitochondrial disease.Continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of clinical stage opportunities in rare diseases.No further specific financial guidance for 2025 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 07:30 CET today.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET/07:30 ET on Thursday  November 6.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of Banijay Group N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://group.banijay.com/results-center/https://group.banijay.com/APPENDIXGlossaryFrance’s 2025 Social Security Financing ActOnline sports betting : the rate of public levies will increase from 54.9% to 59.3% of revenue (GGR- bonus)  coming from a social contribution rate (CSG) that will rise from 10.6% to 15% of revenue.Online poker: the rate of public levies will increase from 0.2% of stakes to 10% of revenue.Online horse race betting: no change.New taxation: the social security financing Act introduces a 15% tax on advertising and promotional campaigns (excluding sports sponsoring) run by gaming operators.GlossaryAdjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization net of reversals (excluding D&A fiction and non-recurring provisions).

So I read the foreword  because for the book itself I’ll wait a few more days and I’m already preparing the 28 euros it costs. Okay  I don’t have a problem paying  but you can’t call it cheap either. So  in his foreword  Alexis “apologizes” in a way—not for what he did while in office  but because… he had good intentions  though the result  of course  was not always the best. As he probably realized afterward  along with… the whole country that paid dearly. Anyway  you should note that what he clearly wants to say is that he had noble and patriotic intentions for the good of the people  etc.  etc.—or at least that’s how I understood it from his foreword  but I reserve judgment. However  I want to focus on one point that Tsipras mentions because I have a personal testimony. He says  in a way (in the foreword)  that he could have waited for the memorandum to be completed with the famous Hardouvelis email and then taken office. That is  for SYRIZA to wait for the elections at their scheduled time  get elected  and not topple the Samaras government early by voting down the President of the Republic. Here’s the excerpt: “When I took responsibility for the country in 2015  the reality was relentless. Many urged me to avoid responsibility  to defer it to others  so that I could take over a completely exhausted country as a ripe fruit. I did not falter. I assumed responsibility when Greece was at one of the most critical junctures in its modern history. The decisions that had to be made were not only politically costly  they carried moral weight  social implications  historical dimension. I felt I was carrying on my shoulders the ghosts of yesterday’s unjust struggles  but also the hopes of an entire generation that dared to believe that things could change.”But Nikos Pappas said something else…I have no reason not to believe Alexis’ statements above  but at that time  just before the first 2015 elections  I had asked his (at the time absolute best friend) Nikos Pappas: “Why don’t you wait for the Hardouvelis email to be voted on  to implement the last act of the memorandum (I remind you  not even 1 billion euros remained)  vote for Kouvelis as President  and take over the country ‘clean’ in a few months?” Pappas’ answer then was… even clearer (December 2014): “What are you saying  are you crazy? Now… that things are turning  we’ll topple them and become the government  and if the situation changes afterward  what will we do? Who lives  who dies…” As you can understand  we have another perspective—or at least another interpretation of the same event! I would say  haste makes waste  although in our case  they tripped the whole country.ELTA – HatzidakisI won’t dwell much on the ELTA case because I think it has been exhausted  regarding the essence of the problem. Besides  I hear that today in Parliament  Pierrakakis will certainly address it. What I honestly don’t understand (or try to understand) is why there is so much intensity and eagerness from Hatzidakis to show that he is not at fault  not responsible  etc. An opposition newspaper  EfSyn… made it a front-page story. So what  so what happened? Small potatoes for a politician  especially when he’s not accused of any fraud; it’s just an issue. I think he is doing himself a disservice because Kostis has dealt with very difficult and substantive issues in the past  not nonsense  which I still believe the ELTA case is.The message from New Democracy MPsOtherwise  in Parliament  a mix of irritation  the disruption of the psychological bond with the media  and the stress of re-election make New Democracy MPs return to “rebellion” through questions. Of course  they don’t want it to appear or be said that they are rebelling  but when they challenge the whole electricity pricing model and “slightly attack” DEI  how should we put it? Obviously  the MPs’ stance is not productive  because they also have something to lose from dismantling the sweater. On the other hand  they feel that if they don’t push now and allow themselves to be taken for granted  their voters will chase them. With all this  it’s pointless to make Charakopoulos secretary of the parliamentary group  because the MPs have resumed the same behavior  just without his participation.A story from ChaniaSince Nikos Karahalis decided yesterday on Liagas to tell stories about his collaboration with Karystianou and revealed her plans to form a party—which she did not deny with a tweet—I’ll tell you another one. Last July  during the height of the cicadas  on the day of the anniversary of the restoration of Democracy  messages started arriving at many media outlets that Karystianou  who was to appear at an event in Chania  would make a weighty political statement toward creating a party. It was even linked to Eleftherios Venizelos  to cleansing  etc. The main distributor of the message was Karahalis  apparently not alone. Anyway  the channels went  interest rose  and Karystianou appeared—while a reception was ongoing at the Presidential Mansion—wondering who told the media about the party plans and of course firmly denying those scenarios…P-TEC and the return of 3+1Otherwise  after yesterday’s receptions of American officials at the Presidential Mansion and Jefferson House  the large P-TEC energy conference opens today. Host is Stavros Papastavrou  while K.M. will open the program on Friday. Naturally  there will also be one-on-one meetings with Bergam and Chris Wright  but the numbers are interesting: 300 companies participating and 1 200 delegates  a record for P-TEC conferences. At the same time  ministers from 25 countries are in Greece  who in the coming days will have opportunities for meetings  contacts  etc. However  the news is that on the occasion of the session  at Zappeion the 3+1 arrangement will be revived with participation from Greece  Cyprus  Israel  and the USA. From Greece: Papastavrou  Cyprus: Giorgos Papanastasiou  Israel: Eli Cohen  USA: Chris Wright. That is indeed significant.Agreements  news  and GilfoyleThis weekend  generally  we will have very interesting news from there. I am told that Exxon Mobil will announce the start of drilling in Greece  the newly established Aktor-DEPA joint venture will have a major collaboration with an American company for LNG transport via the Vertical Corridor  among other things. All of these are much more important for the country  not only economically but also geopolitically  but now we supposedly care about the ELTA issue. Let me tell you  these agreements are the largest ever in the history of Greek-American relations  and the “maestro” is none other than American ambassador Gilfoyle. She has been working on the project long before coming to Athens  and yesterday evening contacts naturally started between Greeks and Americans at the ambassador’s residence  where a formal dinner was held.Kimberly’s acquaintances at the Maximos MansionAnd speaking of Kimberly  at her “first” visit yesterday at the Maximos Mansion she made new acquaintances: Marinakis’ representative  National Security advisor Thanos Dokos  Aristotelia Peloni  Giorgos Efthymiou  and Panos Amyras. Of course  she also met Pinat  who is everywhere.Big Apple vs Red AppleThe election of Mamdani seems to have been a “shock” only for those who did not “read” the polls and did not have deep  multi-layered roots in New York’s market. Based on what has been officially disclosed  at least initially  12% of tech companies from Silicon Alley (not Valley) already have plans to move their financial headquarters mainly to Miami  and later to New Jersey  also under a Democratic Governor. Among them  there seems to be a very prominent exit with Greek involvement  from the Real Estate and Supermarket sector. This particular group of companies  worth several billion dollars  appears to be already in the process of moving its headquarters as—according to Manhattan sources—“they had seen early what was coming and had openly spoken about their intentions.”National Bank announces results without insurance agreementsToday at 10:30 a.m.  National Bank will announce Q3/9-month results. Announcements regarding National Bank’s decisions on bancassurance and new collaborations with insurance companies  as the market expected  will not be made. The reason is that it is on track but the agreement for National Insurance with Piraeus Bank has not yet been completed.The Backstage and Euronext’s Plans for EXAELet’s start market news with developments on the Euronext-EXAE front  as the time is near. We are therefore expecting Euronext to announce tomorrow  Friday  or at the latest on Monday  the new percentage with which it will proceed with the public offer. The 67% is now a thing of the past  and the threshold will likely be set around 50% +1. At the same time  brokers have received a letter informing them that they will receive a 0.40% commission on the value of the shares they submit for exchange. Euronext remains steadfast on the current size of its offer  but I don’t think we should rule out the possibility—especially if the match is tight around 50%+1—of a last-minute  that is  one or two days before the deadline  slight improvement in the offer. However  this is only a probability  and there is no certainty. Behind the scenes  there has been a major mobilization  many meetings  deliberations  and contacts  and it seems that the target for 50% +1 looks feasible. Banks  insurance companies  mutual funds  and institutional investors accept it. The key remains foreign institutional investors who hold significant stakes—for example  JP Morgan Chase with 3.52%  Morgan Stanley with 3.76%  etc. Meanwhile  Praude continues to increase its position (8.12%)  but it is estimated that it is hedging to secure its options because it has purchases at higher prices. The situation with Sandgrove Capital  which holds equity swaps for 5.62% of EXAE  is less clear. Sandgrove  possibly with other funds  is doing arbitrage  going long on EXAE and short on Euronext. As the public offer evolves  with Euronext approaching 50% of EXAE  those in a difficult position will be those who refuse and become trapped after the offer with EXAE shares. In such a case  Euronext  having absolute control  will halt dividends and  most importantly—as noted in the public offer information—will have the ability to make decisions regarding EXAE’s subsidiaries. For example  the Depository may move to Italy  and shareholders will just watch…Spyros Theodoropoulos: “I built a town planning office to get a permit – Which foreign investor could handle this?”Particularly revealing  but also with a great sense of humor  was the president of SEV  Spyros Theodoropoulos  when asked about “how friendly Greece is to investment?” at an event organized by the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE)  as part of Green Deal Greece 2025. Using a personal example that drew attention  he described how a major investment in Stylida turned into a marathon of bureaucracy and how he literally had to “build” a new town planning office from scratch to get a permit. “Two years ago  I bought an old textile factory in Stylida to modernize it and reopen it ” said Spyros Theodoropoulos. However  when the company went to the Lamia Town Planning Office to get a building permit  they said they could not issue it because the office had been on strike for a whole year! The investment was “frozen” for months. Desperate  the businessman asked his contractor what they could do. “He told me: Leave it to me  we will get the permit from the Stylida Town Planning Office. To my surprise  as I knew Stylida had no town planning office. And he said: ‘We will build one!’” And that’s what happened: the contractor approached the mayor of Stylida  who  realizing the deadlock  created a new town planning office from scratch  transferring personnel from the municipality’s technical services. Shortly after  the new office issued the building permit  and the factory was completed. “The question is ” commented the SEV president  “which foreign investor could go through all this adventure? Who would have the patience and the connections to set up… a town planning office from scratch?”The “Bribe” and Stasinou’s Revelation: €50 000 Envelope for TEE PermitEqually revealing about town planning offices was the president of TEE  Giorgos Stasinou  who has publicly supported transferring YDOM from municipalities to the Land Registry. As he publicly admitted yesterday  a town planning office requested a €50 000 bribe for issuing a building permit for a building belonging to TEE itself! The TEE president revealed that when he asked the engineers why the permit process was stalled  they told him the head of the office demanded a “fee” of €50 000 to proceed. “Imagine ” said Stasinou  “asking for a €50 000 bribe not from a private individual  but from TEE itself  the engineers’ association supervising town planning offices!”Dendias  Theodoropoulos  and 50 Entrepreneurs on Defense BusinessReturning to Spyros Theodoropoulos  in the afternoon the SEV president invited Minister of Defense Nikos Dendias to a closed meeting with entrepreneurs—members of SEV—to have an open discussion on all issues and clarify roles and collaborations under the Greek Defense Innovation Center (ELKAK). I am told that around 50 entrepreneurs will attend this closed meeting  for which the SEV booked the amphitheater of the National Gallery.Eurobank’s Plan for ATMs at ELTAEurobank is planning what to do with ATMs operating in ELTA branches whose operation is ending. First  a mapping will take place  followed by implementing a plan to serve customers. Eurobank’s collaboration with ELTA  though no longer exclusive  remains strategic  and many ELTA branches still operate the bank’s ATMs. The plan must be comprehensive  which requires a broad assessment of the landscape: what types of ATMs exist at closing locations  where they can be moved if needed  what services they provide  and how close other bank ATMs or branches are. Eurobank intends  where ELTA branches close  to maintain ATMs in the same location (if possible) or place them nearby. Eurobank’s relationship with ELTA originated from the legal merger with the New Postal Savings Bank (or the “good bank” of TT)  which Eurobank absorbed at the end of 2013.The Time of Bonuses at Intracom HoldingsAfter a sweeping transformation including the sale of subsidiaries such as Intrasoft International (acquired by Netcompany Group)  Intracom Defense (to Israel’s IAI)  the major deal for Europe Asfalistiki  and significant investments from INTRACOM VENTURES  it is now time for changes to the remuneration policy of the board and general managers. The new policy will be voted on tomorrow at an extraordinary general meeting and  if approved  will introduce a new compensation regime  including performance-based bonuses  profit-sharing  stock option plans  in-kind benefits  etc. Beyond cash compensation  company cars  corporate credit cards  life and health insurance  and retirement benefits may be provided. Executive board members receive fees for attending meetings (3 000–7 000 euros per month per person)  lower fees apply for non-executive members  and general managers have a similar fixed-plus-variable pay structure. Strategically  Intracom Holdings’ key projects  particularly the VORIA project  have entered a maturation phase  while real estate investments continue dynamically.Why Greek Shipowners Are Lining Up for the Chinese Shipyard HengliThe explosive rise of Chinese shipyards Hengli has caused a stir in the shipping market  entering the bulk carrier order market rapidly—and notably with a Greek “signature.” Hengli  primarily known as an energy and petrochemical giant  seems to treat its shipyard as a “grain of sand” relative to its overall finances. Yet  this “grain” is causing waves. As one market insider noted  “Hengli builds ships at a pace others need decades to achieve.” The story began simply: the company  after acquiring a shipyard close to closing  started constructing Kamsarmax bulk carriers for its own account. When potential buyers appeared  Hengli did something unprecedented: it sold the already-built ships. Production now runs like an industrial line  not a traditional shipyard. Star Bulk of Petros Pappas placed an order for three bulk carriers  EastMed Group of Thanasis Martinos  and Efnav of Philippos Efstathiou  reportedly signed for four and six ships  respectively. Deliveries are set for 2026–2027  with prices around $36 million per ship. Including the latest deals  Hengli now has over 50 Kamsarmax ships in its global order book—nearly 1/8 of the total market. Other Greek-owned shipping companies  some listed on Wall Street  are also in discussions. Hengli openly declares ambitions to expand influence in high-end international projects  with ships meeting IMO emission standards and prepared for eco-fuels. Considering Cosco Shipping’s chairman Wan Min closely monitors the group  this is not just a shipbuilding success but a Chinese geo-economic strategy to tie shipping more closely to its network.Costamare Plays Defense ConsistentlyCostamare Inc. shows once again why it is considered one of the most disciplined and long-term thinking shipping companies on the Wall Street board. While other players in the sector are tested by freight rate volatility and new balances in container transport  the Konstantakopoulos group continues to invest methodically—this time adding two new 3 100 TEU containerships to its shipbuilding program in China. With this move  the series of new ships now reaches six  all secured with eight-year charter contracts to “blue-chip” clients in the liner market. Deliveries of the first four ships are expected in 2027  while the two new ones will follow in 2028. The cost per unit is estimated at $50–55 million  levels that confirm the shift of investment interest toward “feeder” and “Bangkokmax” sizes of the category. Despite a small drop in net profits ($99 million in Q3 versus $111 million in 2023)  Costamare remains in excellent financial condition: liquidity of $569.6 million  no significant debt maturing until 2027  100% coverage of charter contracts for 2025 and 80% for 2026  and total contracted revenue of $2.6 billion. For Wall Street investors  this means one thing: predictable cash flows in an otherwise volatile sector. It is no coincidence that Jefferies remains positive on the stock  emphasizing that Costamare “plays defense with precision… and buys time for the next upward phase of the cycle.”Market Hopes Rest on TITANTITAN’s market capitalization climbed again above €3 billion (+1.16% to €39.3)  as the company announces nine-month results today.

Now that banking stocks are under pressure from liquidation of profitable positions  market expectations rest on TITAN.Body-to-Body Battles Around the 2 000-Point StrongholdWith the help of Coca Cola (+2.26% to €39.9) and Cenergy (+2.07% to €14.8)  the Athens Stock Exchange General Index once again fended off forces trying to break the psychological stronghold of 2 000 points. With trades of €199.4 million and prearranged block trades totaling €26.5 million  the General Index  after dipping to 1 996.5 points (-0.85%)  managed to rise to 2 017 (+0.18%) and finally closed slightly positive at +0.04% at 2 014.47 points. AKTOR (+4.18% to €8.48  due to news on the partnership with DEPA) and Metlen (+1.20% to €45.6) offered significant support throughout the session. DEI (+0.5% to €15.95) continued steadily toward a market capitalization of €6 billion. The announcement of National Bank’s Q3 results yesterday boosted its stock +0.69% to €13.18  while Piraeus Bank shares came under strong pressure  closing down -1.79% at €6.79 with heavy trading. Jumbo (-2.15% to €27.3) lost part of recent gains  while EYDAP and OTE dropped over 1%. Despite the General Index’s positive close  yesterday’s battle between buyers and sellers ended in a stalemate.The “Greening” of the Skaramagas ShipyardsThe Skaramagas Shipyards  owned by Giorgos Prokopiou  are officially included in the international Green Award program as an Incentive Provider  enhancing their role in promoting environmental excellence and sustainability in shipbuilding.

The Japanese tech company’s market capitalization shrank by $32 billion within hours  causing concern in Asian markets. Led by the charismatic Masayoshi Son  SoftBank is one of the largest tech groups globally. Its investment portfolio ranges from telecommunications to AI  with the Vision Fund holding stakes in hundreds of high-tech startups. Notable investments include Alibaba  Arm Holdings  WeWork  and DoorDash. The stock fell from ¥27 200 to ¥23 000  with analysts attributing the collapse to potential losses in the Vision Fund portfolio and broader AI sector uncertainty  where SoftBank has major exposure. SoftBank manages over $150 billion in assets  but faces pressures from $160 billion in total debt.Who Is the World’s Largest Gold Buyer? (Not China or India)India has traditionally been one of the world’s largest gold buyers. China has systematically invested in gold in recent years  aiming to undermine the dollar’s dominance in a multipolar world. This year  however  the world’s largest gold buyer was… Poland  which is stacking gold bars in its vaults as if preparing for a new Cold War. Poland acquired nearly 67 tons of gold this year  surpassing every other country. “Gold is the only safe asset ” states the central bank governor Adam Glapiński bluntly. Warsaw has set a target of 30% of its reserves in gold. Currently  it is at 24%. Simple arithmetic shows it will buy another 150 tons to reach its goal. Poland is concerned not only about Russia  but also the FED and the ECB. Geopolitical uncertainty at its eastern borders combines with suspicion of the dollar and the euro. Warsaw is building its own wooden—actually  golden—walls  seeking financial independence.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.13,0.17,0.7,True,English,"['The Americans', 'big deals', 'urban planner', 'Kimberly', 'P-TEC', 'Alexis', 'Ithaca', 'Papas', 'Laestrygonians', 'Spyros', 'story', 'Chania', 'absolute best friend', 'electricity pricing model', 'weighty political statement', 'famous Hardouvelis email', 'many media outlets', 'New Democracy MPs', 'usual government news', 'MPs’ stance', 'patriotic intentions', 'one point', 'personal testimony', 'Samaras government', 'ripe fruit', 'critical junctures', 'modern history', 'moral weight', 'social implications', 'historical dimension', 'unjust struggles', 'entire generation', 'Nikos Pappas', 'last act', 'Pappas’ answer', 'opposition newspaper', 'Small potatoes', 'substantive issues', 'psychological bond', 'other hand', 'parliamentary group', 'same behavior', 'Eleftherios Venizelos', 'main distributor', 'Alexis’ statements', 'good intentions', 'first 2015 elections', '1 billion euros', 'same event', 'front-page story', 'Nikos Karahalis', 'scheduled time', 'Alexis Tsipras', 'ELTA case', '28 euros', 'Newsroom', 'anticipated', 'book', 'foreword', 'problem', 'way', 'office', 'result', 'course', 'country', 'noble', 'people', 'judgment', 'memorandum', 'SYRIZA', 'President', 'Republic', 'excerpt', 'responsibility', 'reality', 'others', 'Greece', 'decisions', 'shoulders', 'ghosts', 'yesterday', 'hopes', 'things', 'something', 'reason', 'Kouvelis', 'months', 'December', 'situation', 'perspective', 'interpretation', 'haste', 'waste', 'Hatzidakis', 'essence', 'Pierrakakis', 'intensity', 'eagerness', 'fault', 'EfSyn', 'politician', 'fraud', 'disservice', 'Kostis', 'difficult', 'past', 'message', 'mix', 'irritation', 'disruption', 'stress', 'rebellion', 'questions', 'DEI', 'sweater', 'voters', 'Charakopoulos', 'participation', 'Chania', 'Liagas', 'stories', 'collaboration', 'Karystianou', 'plans', 'party', 'tweet', 'height', 'cicadas', 'anniversary', 'restoration', 'cleansing']",2025-11-06,2025-11-07,en.protothema.gr
