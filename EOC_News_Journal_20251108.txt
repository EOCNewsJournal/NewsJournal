With some in Norway saying their…,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is keen for further financial support from European allies - Copyright AFP Angelos TZORTZINISPierre-Henry DESHAYESNorway has grown vastly richer after overtaking Russia as Europe’s main gas supplier following the invasion of Ukraine  sparking calls in Oslo for the Scandinavian nation to use its colossal sovereign wealth fund to help Kyiv.With some in Norway saying their country’s windfall makes it a “war profiteer”  several Norwegian political parties  including allies of the Labour government  are pushing for Oslo to help lift a main obstacle blocking Europe from using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine financially.Western nations have frozen billions in Russian assets over Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine  including approximately 210 billion euros ($243 billion) held in Europe.Ukraine’s European allies have been using interest from those funds to support Kyiv  but are keen to go further by tapping the funds themselves — a proposal some warn carries huge risks  including spooking other foreign nations into pulling their money from the European Union.That is where Norway comes in.“It is absolutely essential for Europe’s security that Russia does not win its illegal war of aggression ” the head of Norway’s small opposition Liberal Party  Guri Melby  told AFP.“Norway has the financial means to guarantee a loan that would enable Ukraine to better defend itself against Russia  and I think we should do it ” she said.– Backing for mega-loan –The plan goes like this.At a time when many EU member states have strained public finances  the European Commission plans to use part of the frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine a 140-billion-euro loan  interest free  to finance its budgetary and military support over the next two years.But Belgium  home to the international deposit organisation Euroclear  which holds the bulk of the frozen assets  has demanded strict guarantees from other EU countries in order to share the risks in the event  for example  that Russia were to regain possession of its assets.Some heavily indebted countries  such as France  would have a hard time agreeing to such a demand.Arguing that Norway  Western Europe’s biggest oil and gas producer  made an extra 109 billion euros from soaring gas prices after Russia’s invasion  two Norwegian economists have suggested their country should step up even though it is not an EU member.“By hoarding these profits  Norway’s government turned the country into a war profiteer ” the duo  Havard Halland and Knut Anton Mork  wrote in an op-ed last month.Thanks to its AAA credit rating — the highest awarded by rating agencies — and its sovereign wealth fund  the world’s biggest  valued at around $2.1 trillion  Norway “could singlehandedly take on the contingent liability associated with fresh Ukrainian debt  and without a dent to its credit rating”  they said.The idea resonated with some European political leaders.“That would be great ” said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen during an EU summit in Copenhagen last month.Norway’s government  which has already earmarked civil and military aid of more than 275 billion kroner ($27.4 billion) to Kyiv over the 2023-2030 period  is proceeding cautiously.“We are closely monitoring the situation and continuing our dialogue with the European Union ” said finance ministry state secretary Ellen Reitan.– ‘Moral obligation’ –According to AFP’s sources  Norway is in talks with Brussels but has no current plans to provide a single-handed safety net to Kyiv.Norway’s Greens Party is considering making the issue one of its demands in upcoming budget negotiations with the government  which needs the Greens’ support  among others  to pass its 2026 budget bill.“Norway is the only country in Europe that has so much money set aside and can allocate such a sum without needing to take on debt or raise taxes ” Greens leader Arild Hermstad told AFP.“And besides  we have made so much money as a result of this war that it is simply a moral obligation.”,neutral,0.01,0.81,0.19,mixed,0.2,0.21,0.59,True,English,"['war profiteer', 'financial

In addition  consistent trends in improvements were shown in fatigue and pruritus symptoms. At week 182  72% of patients receiving IQIRVO maintained a biochemical response  with a 47% reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from baseline. The proportion of patients achieving normal ALP levels remained consistent with previously presented Phase III results from the ELATIVE trial. Improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue were sustained  with similar results observed for pruritus and data also confirmed a long-term  well-characterized safety profile with no new safety signals.1“PBC does not impact all patients in the same way. Therefore  it is important for us to have access to data associated with long-term treatment benefit on the disease biomarkers and liver tests  as well as a positive impact on symptoms. These preliminary results  which indicate a potential improvement not only in pruritus  but also in fatigue  are very encouraging ” said Dr. Cynthia Levy  Professor of Medicine  Division of Digestive Health and Liver Diseases  University of Miami. “We need to regularly monitor our patients with PBC over their lifetime and this data from the ELATIVE trial confirms that elafibranor is an effective treatment  with a reassuring  well-characterized safety profile  over the long-term.”In a second late-breaking presentation of a further analysis of the ELATIVE trial  showing the relationship between changes in the expression of fatigue-associated proteins and reported outcomes of fatigue in patients on IQIRVO  was presented. 2 The clinical findings from this analysis are consistent with previously published mechanistic data3  suggesting that PPAR α/δ agonist activation may modulate key pathways involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. Fatigue remains one of the most common and burdensome symptoms for patients with PBC. Currently  there are no therapies approved to address it  however  clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue have been observed with IQIRVO  which is a PPAR α/δ agonist  versus placebo  in the ELATIVE trial with around one in two patients reporting a significant reduction in fatigue severity.4 Together  these data support further research into how IQIRVO may help address fatigue in PBC.“These findings underscore IQIRVO’s potential as a long-term treatment option that not only manages the markers of disease progression and symptoms that impact the quality of life of people living with PBC  but also helps us better understand the mechanisms behind fatigue ” said Sandra Silvestri  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Ipsen. “With a consistent safety profile over three years and these emerging mechanistic insights  IQIRVO is positioned to play a transformative role in the management of PBC.”About the ELATIVE TrialELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Patients continued their assigned treatment after Week 52 until all patients had completed their treatment  or for a maximum of 104 weeks. The open-label long-term extension of ELATIVE remains ongoing.About IQIRVO® (elafibranor)Iqirvo (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist  which exerts an effect on PPARα and PPARδ. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ decreases bile toxicity and improves cholestasis by modulating bile acid synthesis  detoxification and transporters. Activation of PPARα and PPARδ also has anti-inflammatory effects by acting on different pathways. In 2019  Iqirvo was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Iqirvo was granted U.S. FDA accelerated approval in June 2024  conditional approval by the EMA in September 2024 and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in October 2024  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. The FDA  EMA and MHRA approvals are contingent on the further verification of clinical benefit. Iqirvo is currently in regulatory processes with other authorities. Iqirvo (elafibranor) was developed by GENFIT. Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.About Primary Biliary CholangitisPBC is a rare  autoimmune liver disease where a build-up of bile and toxins and chronic inflammation cause irreversible fibrosis of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. Impacting approximately 100 000 people in the US and 165 000 people in Europe  the majority being women  PBC is a lifelong condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated and may lead to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by internal and external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 100 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

It has a pipeline of almost 2 000. It currently owns 31 hotels  leases 22 and operates three under management contracts.Dalata shareholders  including chief executive Dermot Crowley  will get the proceeds from the sale no later than November 21  making for a pre-Christmas windfall for investors.In July  the Dalata board recommended an all-cash offer of €6.45 per share from the Pandox consortium which represented a near 50pc premium to the twelve-month volume-weighted average share price up to March 6.The closing of the sale marks another exit from the stock exchange in Dublin.Companies including CRH  Flutter Entertainment  DCC  Greencore and Datalex are among those that were once listed on the dwindling exchange.The company being used to effect the acquisition of Dalata is Pandox Ireland Tuck.Dalata  which was founded by former chief executive Pat McCann  said the scheme of arrangement in connection with the final recommended cash offer by Pandox Ireland Tuck became effective today.It confirmed that its shares will be delisted from Euronext Dublin and from the main market of the London Stock Exchange by 7am next Monday.Releasing first-half results in August  Dalata said its revenue per available room across Ireland has remained stable at the same level as last year despite figures showing a clear decline in visitor numbers to the country  especially earlier in the year.Revenue at the group in the first half of the year edged 1pc higher to €306.5m. Its adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation declined 5pc to €102.5m.Profit after tax tumbled 45pc to €19.6m  the company noted in its results. It blamed the sharp fall in after-tax profits on the cost of its strategic review that led to the agreed sale of the business  as well as an increase in non-cash accounting charges.During the first half of the year  Dalata completed the €83m acquisition of the Radisson Blu hotel on the Dublin Airport campus. The 229-bedroom property will be rebranded as a Clayton hotel next year.Dalata also completed a number of deals in cities including Berlin  Madrid and Edinburgh.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['Hotel group Dalata', '€1.4bn acquisition', 'Monday', 'former chief executive Pat McCann', 'twelve-month volume-weighted average share price', 'chief executive Dermot Crowley', 'near 50pc premium', 'Radisson Blu hotel', 'cash accounting charges', 'Dublin Airport campus', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Pandox Ireland Tuck', 'Irish hotel group', 'Irish group', 'cash offer', 'dwindling exchange', 'Pandox consortium', 'mainland Europe', 'Maldron brands', 'management contracts', 'Christmas windfall', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Euronext Dublin', 'main market', 'available room', 'same level', 'clear decline', 'visitor numbers', 'first half', 'sharp fall', 'strategic review', '229-bedroom property', 'Clayton hotel', 'hotel company', 'Scandinavian investors', 'first-half results', '€83m acquisition', 'tax profits', '€1.4bn sale', 'last year', 'Dalata shareholders', 'Dalata board', 'Shares', 'Monday', 'properties', 'UK', 'Eiendomsspa', '56 hotels', '12,000 rooms', 'pipeline', '31 hotels', 'proceeds', 'November', 'July', 'March', 'closing', 'exit', 'Companies', 'CRH', 'DCC', 'Greencore', 'Datalex', 'scheme', 'arrangement', 'connection', 'final', '7am', 'August', 'revenue', 'figures', 'country', 'earnings', 'interest', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'cost', 'business', 'increase', 'deals', 'cities', 'Berlin', 'Madrid', 'Edinburgh']",2025-11-07,2025-11-08,independent.ie

Our lasme-cel program for r/r B-ALL and eti-cel program for r/r NHL demonstrated their ability to induce deep and meaningful responses  underscoring their potential to improve outcomes in diseases with high unmet medical needs” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. “We look forward to sharing an additional development update on eti-cel at the ASH 2025 Annual Meeting and to provide the first interim analysis for the pivotal Phase 2 BALLI-01 trial in Q4 2026. Together  these milestones strengthen our leadership in allogeneic CAR-T innovation and position Cellectis for a transformative year ahead.""_______________1 Cash  cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits include restricted cash of $4.4 million as of September 30  2025 and fixed-term deposits of $168.2 million as of September 30  2025  of which $137.6 million are classified as current financial assets and $30.6 million are classified as non-current financial assets (due to a fixed bank deposit investment maturing in October 2026  including accrued interest).Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical ProgramsBALLI-01 study evaluating lasme-cel (UCART22)Clinical data from the Phase 1 BALLI-01 study with lasme-cel for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)  were presented at the Cellectis’ R&D Day that took place on October 16  2025. The presented data position lasme-cel as a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with r/r B-ALL.In the Phase 1 of BALLI-01 study  40 transplant ineligible third line or beyond (3L+) patients were dosed with lasme-cel: 18 patients (n=18) were dosed with product manufactured by an external CDMO (Process 1  or P1) and 22 patients (n=22) were dosed with Cellectis-manufactured product (Process 2  or P2).Highlights include:Efficacy: lasme-cel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% with Process 2 product (n=22)  and an ORR of 83% at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D; n=12) and 100% in the target Phase 2 population (n=9)Safety: in Phase 1 (n=40)  lasme-cel was generally well tolerated; there was one case of grade 2 immune effector cell–associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS)  which resolved.Durability: among patients who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi)  median overall survival was 14.8 months.Depth of response in target Phase 2 population: the CR/CRi rate was 56%  with approximately 80% of these patients achieving MRD-negative status.Transplant eligibility in target Phase 2 population: all patients (100%) became eligible for transplant  and 78% proceeded to transplantation.The survival curve for this study suggests a clear benefit: patients who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after lasme-cel therapy showed a trend to longer overall survival than those who did not undergo transplant.The Phase 1 data showed that lasme-cel maintained its efficacy regardless of the number or type of prior lines of treatments  including CAR-T (60% of subjects)  transplant (50% of patients)  and blinatumomab (80% of subjects).Following successful End-of-Phase 1 meetings with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  Cellectis provided a registration path for lasme-cel in r/r ALL. The first interim analysis for the Phase 2 of the BALLI-01 trial is expected in Q4 2026. Cellectis anticipates submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2028.Commercial Opportunity for Lasme-celAs part of the R&D Day presentation  the Company discussed the potential commercial opportunity for lasme-cel in r/r B-ALL.If approved for commercialization  Cellectis estimates that lasme-cel could achieve up to approximately $700 million in potential peak gross sales across the U.S.  EU4 (France  Germany  Italy  Spain) and UK in 2035  corresponding to an estimation of about 1 100 patients treated annually. Furthermore  gross peak sales could increase to up to approximately $1.3 billion with potential label expansion to second line and first line MRD+ consolidation. These estimates highlight that lasme-cel has the potential to drive meaningful growth of the CAR-T market in B-ALL  leading to a robust peak sales potential with attractive margins stemming from the allogeneic approach.American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2025 annual meeting poster presentationOn November 3  2025  Cellectis announced the acceptance of an abstract for lasme-cel for poster presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2025 annual congress  that will take place on December 6-9  2025.The poster highlights the correlation between alemtuzumab exposure and depth of response in the difficult-to-treat r/r ALL patients who have received lasme-cel. Additionally  the data identifies a threshold exposure level of alemtuzumab above which achieving a complete response/complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) is more likely without any increase in toxicities.The poster presentation will occur on December 8  2025  6:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET  in Room OCCC - West Halls B3-B4.NatHaLi-01 study evaluating eti-cel (UCART20x22)At the R&D Day  Cellectis unveiled preliminary data on eti-cel  its allogeneic CAR-T product candidate for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL)  demonstrating an encouraging ORR of 86% and CR rate of 57% at the current dose level (n=7)  with 4 out of 7 patients achieving a complete response. The preliminary high rate of complete responses underscores the potential of this innovative approach to transform outcomes for r/r NHL patients. Cellectis expects to present the full Phase 1 dataset for eti-cel  including low-dose IL-2 combination cohorts  in 2026.On November 3  2025  Cellectis announced the acceptance of an abstract for poster presentation at ASH 2025.The poster provides a development update on eti-cel for patients with r/r NHL and outlines the addition of low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) to further deepen and extend anti-tumor activity of eti-cel in patients with r/r NHL  supported by compelling preclinical data.The poster presentation will occur on December 7  2025 at 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM ET  in Room OCCC – West Halls B3-B4.InnovationCircular single-stranded DNA (CssDNA) as a non-viral template for gene therapyIn October 2025  Cellectis presented findings in a poster  highlighting the strong potential of circular single-stranded DNA (CssDNA) as a universal  efficient non-viral template for gene therapy  at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) annual congress.Over the past decade  non-viral DNA template delivery has been used with engineered nucleases to target single-stranded DNA sequences in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).While developed for gene therapy purposes  so far this method has been restricted to gene corrections. To expand this scope  Cellectis developed an editing process using its gene editing technology and kilobase-long circular single-stranded DNA donor templates.The data presented show that:CssDNA editing process achieved high gene insertion frequency in viable HSPCs. CssDNA-edited HSPCs show a higher propensity to engraft and maintain gene edits in a murine model than adeno-associated viruses (AAV)-edited HSPCs.TALE base editors (TALEB) off-targets in the nuclear genomeAt ESGCT 2025  the Company presented in a poster a comprehensive study of TALE base editors (TALEB) off-targets in the nuclear genome.TALE base editors (TALEB) are fusions of a transcription activator-like effector domain (TALE)  split-DddA deaminase halves  and an uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI).These recent additions to the genome editing toolbox can directly edit double strand DNA  converting a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) through the formation of an uracil (U) intermediate without the need of DNA break. Base editing has great potential in therapeutic applications. However  being able to avoid potential off-target effects is key toward this goal.To evaluate TALEB safety  Cellectis combined advanced bioinformatic predictions with multiple experimental approaches to investigate potential off-target effects in the nuclear genome of primary T cells.The study found no evidence of biases towards off-site C-to-T editing at sites flanked by CTCF binding sites  a key DNA-binding protein that regulates genome organization and gene expression at genome wide level.These results provide a strong framework for the safe development of TALEB in therapeutic cell engineering  supporting their potential for future nuclear and mitochondrial applications.AstraZeneca – Joint Research and Collaboration AgreementIn its presentation during the Cellectis’ R&D Day held in October  AstraZeneca highlighted the significance of its strategic investment and research collaboration with Cellectis to accelerate its cell therapy and genomic medicine ambitions. The collaboration leverages Cellectis’ gene editing expertise and manufacturing capabilities to develop up to 10 novel cell and gene therapy products for areas of high unmet medical need  including oncology  immunology and rare genetic disorders.Servier arbitrationWith respect to the ongoing arbitration proceeding through the Centre de Médiation et d’Arbitrage de Paris  the arbitral decision is expected to be rendered on or before December 15  2025.IovanceIn November 2025  Iovance reported that clinical results for IOV-4001  a PD-1 inactivated TIL cell therapy  in previously treated advanced melanoma patients are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. Other potential indications for IOV-4001 are also in development.Financial ResultsCash  cash equivalent and fixed-term deposits: As of September 30  2025  Cellectis had $225 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current and non-current financial assets. The Company believes its cash  cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits will be sufficient to fund its operations into H2 2027.This compares to $264 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets as of December 31  2024  with no fixed-term deposits classified as non-current financial assets as of such date. This $39 million change includes $30.5 million of cash-in from our revenue  $7.1 million of interest received from our financial and cash-equivalent investments  $2.9 million cash-in from credit VAT  $1.5 million cash-in from other financial investments  offset by cash payments from Cellectis to suppliers of $35.5 million  Cellectis’ wages  bonuses and social expenses paid of $32.4 million  the payments of lease debts of $8.1 million  the repayment of the “PGE” loan of $4.0 million and the payments of capital expenditures for $3.0 million.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending in supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical development expenses of lasme-cel  eti-cel and potential new product candidates  and operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France) and Raleigh (North Carolina).Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $67.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to $34.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024. This $33.3 million increase between the nine-month period ended September 30  2024 and 2025 was mainly driven by the evolution of activities performed in connection with the Research Plans and fulfillment of our performance obligations under the AstraZeneca Joint Research and Collaboration Agreement. As a reminder  revenues as recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30  2024 included a $5.4 million development milestone under the License Agreement with Servier.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $69.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to $69.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024  down by $0.6 million mainly driven by a decrease in purchases & external expenses of $2.1 million  offset by an increase of $1.7 million in R&D personnel expenses of which non-cash stock-based compensation increase by $1.0 million and wages and salaries increase by $0.7 million.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $15.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to $14.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024. The $0.8 million change is mainly due to a non-cash stock-based compensation increase of $0.7 million and an increase of $0.1 million in purchases and external expenses.Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income increased slightly by $0.1 million between the nine-month periods ended September 30  2024  and 2025.Net financial gain (loss): We had a consolidated net financial loss of $25.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to an $5.7 million net financial gain for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024. This $31.2 million difference reflects mainly (i) a one-off $14.3 million gain in change in fair value of the derivative instrument component of the Subsequent Investment Agreement dated November 7  2023 between us and AstraZeneca Holdings (the “SIA”)  which was recognized in the nine-month period ended September 30  2024  (ii) a $5.8 million loss in the fair value remeasurement of the warrants issued to the European Investment Bank (""EIB"")  as required by our finance contract entered into with EIB in December 2022 recorded in nine months period as of September 2025 to be compared to $3.9 million fair value gain recorded in 2024  (iii) a $16.7 million increase in foreign exchange loss and a $2.0 million increase in foreign exchange gain over the period due to the USD volatility  partially offset by (iv) a $7.5 million decrease in loss on fair value of our investment in shares of Cibus  Inc.  which was entirely sold in the first quarter of 2025.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $41.3 million (or a $0.41 net loss per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to a $42.7 million net loss (or a $0.49 net loss per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024. The $1.4 million change in net loss was primarily driven by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $33.3 million offset by (ii) a $0.2 million increase in operating expenses and other operating income  (iii) a $31.2 million change from a net financial gain of $5.7 million as of September 30  2024 to a net financial loss of $25.6 million as of September 30  2025 and (iv) a decrease in deferred tax asset income of $0.5 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: Consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $37.4 million (or a $0.37 loss per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  compared to a net loss of $40.4 million (or a $0.46 loss per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30  2024.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.CELLECTIS S.A.INTERIM CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)($ in thousands)As of December 31  2024 September 30  2025 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 116 845 Property  plant  and equipment 45 895 41 198 Right-of-use assets 29 968 25 512 Non-current financial assets 7 521 35 736 Other non-current assets 11 594 18 179 Deferred tax assets 382 382 Total non-current assets 96 476 121 852 Current assets Trade receivables 6 714 8 056 Subsidies receivables 14 521 16 411 Other current assets 5 528 4 503 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 260 306 192 223 Total current assets 287 069 221 193 TOTAL ASSETS 383 544 343 045 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 5 889 5 902 Premiums related to the share capital 494 288 435 162 Currency translation adjustment (39 537 ) (32 725 ) Retained earnings (292 846 ) (266 586 ) Net income (loss) (36 761 ) (41 275 ) Total shareholders’ equity - Group Share 131 033 100 478 Non-controlling interests - - Total shareholders’ equity 131 033 100 478 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 50 882 63 399 Non-current lease debts 34 245 29 252 Non-current provisions 1 115 1 339 Total non-current liabilities 86 241 93 990 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 16 134 18 240 Current lease debts 8 385 8 331 Trade payables 18 664 16 095 Deferred revenues and deferred income 112 161 94 008 Current provisions 828 1 082 Other current liabilities 10 097 10 820 Total current liabilities 166 269 148 577 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 383 544 343 045Cellectis S.A.INTERIM CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS (unaudited)For the nine-month period ended September 30  2025($ in thousands  except per share amounts)For the nine-month period ended September 30  2024 2025 Revenues and other income Revenues 28 789 62 552 Other income 5 263 4 834 Total revenues and other income 34 052 67 386 Operating expenses Research and development expenses (69 670 ) (69 081 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (14 153 ) (14 988 ) Other operating income (expenses) 896 958 Total operating expenses (82 926 ) (83 111 ) Operating income (loss) (48 874 ) (15 725 ) Financial gain (loss) 5 677 (25 550 ) Income tax 514 - Net income (loss) (42 683 ) (41 275 ) Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (42 683 ) (41 275 ) Basic net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.49 ) (0.41 ) Diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.49 ) (0.41 ) Number of shares used for computing Basic 87 355 605 100 262 948 Diluted 87 355 605 100 262 948UNAUDITED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSFor the three-month period ended September 30  2025($ in thousands  except per share amounts)For the three-month period endedSeptember 30  2024 2025 Revenues and other income Revenues 16 200 35 172 Other income 1 851 1 992 Total revenues and other income 18 050 37 164 Operating expenses Research and development expenses (23 829 ) (24 069 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (5 167 ) (5 208 ) Other operating income (expenses) 175 154 Total operating expenses (28 820 ) (29 123 ) Operating income (loss) (10 769 ) 8 041 Financial gain (loss) (12 346 ) (7 452 ) Income tax 59 - Net income (loss) (23 056 ) 589 Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (23 056 ) 589 Attributable to non-controlling interests - - Basic net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.23 ) 0.01 Diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.23 ) 0.01 Number of shares used for computing Basic 100 093 635 100 325 229 Diluted 100 093 635 101 708 538Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresCellectis S.A. presents adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis in this press release. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS.Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes stock-based compensation expense - a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)For the nine-month period ended September 30  2025($ in thousands  except per share data)For the nine-month period endedSeptember 30  2024 2025 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (42 683 ) (41 275 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 283 3 860 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (40 400 ) (37 415 ) Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.46 ) (0.37 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 87 355 605 100 262 948 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.46 ) (0.37 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 87 355 605 100 262 948RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME (unaudited)For the three-month period ended September 30  2025($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period endedSeptember 30  2024 2025 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (23 056 ) 589 Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 566 1 602 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (22 490 ) 2 191 Basic adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.22 ) 0.02 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 100 093 635 100 325 229 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.22 ) 0.02 Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 100 093 635 101 708 538About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Positive results from the pivotal LIBERTY-AFRS-AIMS phase 3 study (NCT04684524) evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults and children aged 6 years and older with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) demonstrated significant improvements in signs and symptoms of disease across all primary and secondary endpoints  including reductions in sinus opacification  nasal congestion  and nasal polyps compared to placebo. These are the first-ever positive phase 3 results specifically in AFRS and will be shared today at the American College of Allergy  Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting  Orlando  FL  US.Recently  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Dupixent in adults and children aged 6 years and older with AFRS. Priority review is granted by the FDA to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions. If approved  AFRS would represent the ninth FDA-approved indication for Dupixent.AFRS  a subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis  is a chronic type 2 inflammatory disease of the sinuses caused by an intense allergic hypersensitivity to fungi  most usually aspergillus. It primarily affects people living in warm  humid climates where fungal spores are common in the environment. It can lead to nasal polyps  nasal congestion  loss of smell  thick mucus discharge  poor health-related quality of life  bone loss around the sinus cavities  and facial deformities. AFRS is a unique and distinct type of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps that can be harder to treat because it does not respond well to available options. Current standard-of-care treatment is surgery and prolonged courses of systemic steroids; however  disease recurrence can occur.“People with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis live with persistent nasal obstruction  congestion  and polyps that can place a great strain on their day-to-day lives. With limited treatment options  uncontrolled symptoms can progress to serious complications like the buildup of thick mucus that may require surgery  bony erosion of the sinuses  and facial deformities ” said Amber U. Luong  MD  PhD  FACS  Professor and Vice Chair for Academic Affairs in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the McGovern Medical School of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston  US and lead investigator of the study. “This study is significant as it is the first positive phase 3 study for an investigational treatment specifically for AFRS. The ability of Dupixent to alleviate the hallmark signs and symptoms of AFRS  and to reduce the risk for surgery and corticosteroids by 92%  provide the strongest evidence to date that IL4 and IL13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation leading to this disease  as they seem to be for multiple other type 2 inflammatory diseases.”In the LIBERTY-AFRS-AIMS study  62 adults and children aged 6 years and older with AFRS were randomized to receive an age- and weight-based dose of Dupixent (200 mg or 300 mg; n=33) every two or four weeks or placebo (n=29). The differences for Dupixent compared to placebo were as follows:Primary Endpoint: Sinus opacification scores (a measure of nasal congestion as assessed by computed tomography [CT] scans) improved by 50.0% in the Dupixent group versus 9.8% in the placebo group at 52 weeks (7.36-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001); a significant reduction in sinus opacification scores was also observed at 24 weeks (p<0.0001)Sinus opacification scores (a measure of nasal congestion as assessed by computed tomography [CT] scans) improved by 50.0% in the Dupixent group versus 9.8% in the placebo group at 52 weeks (7.36-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001); a significant reduction in sinus opacification scores was also observed at 24 weeks (p<0.0001) Secondary Endpoints: Patient-reported nasal congestion/obstruction improved by 66.7% in the Dupixent group versus 25.3% in the placebo group at 24 weeks (0.87-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001)  with continued improvement at 52 weeks to 80.6% in the Dupixent group compared to 11.1% in the placebo group (1.40-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001) Nasal polyp size (as assessed by endoscopy) reduced by 60.8% in the Dupixent group compared to 15.2% in the placebo group at 24 weeks (2.36-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001)  with continued reduction of 62.5% in the Dupixent group compared to 3.6% in the placebo group up to 52 weeks (2.77-point placebo-corrected reduction; p<0.0001) 92% lower risk of systemic corticosteroid use and/or in need of surgery in the Dupixent group compared to placebo (29.1% fewer proportion of patients; p=0.0010) over 52 weeksThe safety in the study was generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. The overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 70% with Dupixent and 79% with placebo. The most common treatment-emergent AEs (>10%) occurring more frequently in Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (15% Dupixent  14% placebo) and nosebleed (12% Dupixent  4% placebo). Serious AEs were reported in 0% and 7% of patients treated with Dupixent and placebo  respectively. Additionally  AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were reported in 3% of Dupixent patients and 4% of placebo patients.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in AFRS have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About LIBERTY-AFRS-AIMSLIBERTY-AFRS-AIMS is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled phase 3 study assessing the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in adults and children aged 6 years and older with AFRS. During the 52-week study  patients received an age- and weight-based dose of Dupixent (300 mg every two weeks for adults and children weighing ≥60 kg  200 mg every two weeks for children weighing ≥30 kg to <60 kg  or 300 mg every four weeks for children weighing ≥15 kg to <30 kg) or placebo. More than 80% of patients had a history of type 2 comorbidities.The primary endpoint assessed change from baseline in sinus opacification assessed by CT scans using the Lund-Mackay score (LMK; scale: 0-24) at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints assessed at 24 weeks included:Change from baseline in patient-reported nasal congestion (NC; scale: 0-3)Change from baseline in nasal polyp score (NPS; scale: 0-8) as measured by endoscopyLMK scoreSecondary endpoints assessed at 52 weeks included:Change from baseline in NPSChange from baseline in NCProportion of patients requiring surgery or systemic corticosteroidsAbout DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and bullous pemphigoid in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  lichen simplex chronicus  and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The presence of 30 American and European ministers in Athens and the commercial agreements for energy  with the corresponding geopolitical significance for Greece  are indeed good news. If one considers that two months ago… we were crying our fate – if not all of us  at least the opposition – about the “international isolation of the country” because of Mitsotakis  the rejection we got from Erdogan  the snubbing by Trump etc. Well  between us  that didn’t show much yesterday from the presence of two top ministers who are Trump’s “tablemates”  and 25 Ministers of Energy of Europe and the Balkans. Now all this was happening in Zappeion and at the same time a few dozen meters down pupils were demonstrating for Palestine (the needle got stuck again…) but what can we do  this is Greece.The 3+1 is stabilizingI wrote yesterday about the first meeting after a long time of the 3+1 scheme at energy minister level Greece–Cyprus–Israel  with the participation of the American  which took place on the sidelines of the Conference. Let me tell you that among other things the GSI cable was discussed  while the Cypriot minister Papapastasiou put on the table the destabilizing role of Turkey  without however appearing like he is “complaining”. The most interesting thing I learn is that the scheme becomes permanent and apparently in the first half of 2026 Papastavrou will pack his suitcases for Washington  for the repeat session.The VIP lunch at AigliI stay on P-TEC  because my guy “caught” an interesting mobility at noon  during the lunch break  at the restaurant “Aigli Zappeiou”. Four major companies  ACEBA  BECHTEL  Westinghouse and the Nuclear Energy Institute made an invite with main face the American Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the very heavy names of the forum and of course most of the American officials who flooded the Athens center. From Greece present was Stavros Papastavrou  who in general was receiving kudos as host.End to suspensionsFrom Zappeion I go to Crete and to the measures on gun possession being announced. This morning Chrysochoidis from Heraklion will describe the installation of the FBI on the island  but also in general the police security plan that must be readjusted in light of the new data. He will also describe the interventions on gun possession  I understand the central idea is to cut suspensions for sentences related to gun possession  as well as the suspensive effect in first instance sentences up to the appeal. In other words  someone facing serious prosecution for illegal gun possession to go to jail. Not of course for a knife or a pocketknife  but for heavy weapons. K.M will also refer to the issue on Sunday in his post. Of course  how far this solves the problem I honestly doubt  because we are talking about a “misery” of centuries.The fight of the dayAlways the fights of politicians in Parliament or on TV have fun but yesterday’s between Giannoulis (SYRIZA) and Petros Pappas (SYRIZA–Kasselakis–PASOK) was top. What acrobat the one called the other  what illiterate  what errand boy and it ended with the old time classic of Panos Kammenos where Pappas accused Giannoulis that “he’s begging on all fours” to Tsipras to take him into his party. Don’t tell me left wing fights are not always the best? I am trying to predict the next one  at the level of party change  I feel something that Theodora Tzakri might be it  but I’m not betting.Announcements about Motor Oil strategyWe wrote a few days ago that Motor Oil has started a process for selling 49% of ANEMOS and is close to agreement with a big foreign energy player that has Greek presence. In the stock exchange announcement that Motor Oil issued on 4/11/25 and informs that its financial results will be announced 19/11 and a teleconference will follow 20/11 and after the typical and usual are mentioned in the announcement  there is the following phrase: “Additionally in the context of the above teleconference the management of the company will proceed to inform regarding the group’s strategy”.Don’t speak  it is not necessaryNational Bank as recorded in the 9 month results “is bursting” with capital. And this was the main observation and concern of analysts: how the bank management will utilize these capital  apart of course from the high distributions. CET1 stood at 19.0%  marking an increase of about 10 basis points relative to the previous quarter and about 70 basis points from the beginning of the year  despite the fact there was provision also in the 9 months for dividend distribution in the 2025 year of 60% from the bank’s profits. Yesterday the bank CEO Pavlos Mylonas in the teleconference received persistent questions from analysts about what he intends to do with the capital buffer. For his part he refused equally persistently to answer and anyway he could not do otherwise. He was specifically asked about bancassurance and he stated he cannot comment – as the column predicted yesterday – because the negotiation with CVC for the sale of 10% of National Insurance has not yet closed  which is also heading to Piraeus Bank. Until the completion of the negotiation NBG management cannot speak publicly about its plans in the sector which however will not take long to be revealed. A small hint Mylonas gave was that there are not many opportunities in the domestic market and that he does not intend to make any investment without it producing economic result and synergies for the bank. He also received a question about plans regarding Cyprus where he answered curtly with the known “no comment”  which made some think because as an answer it also accepts the interpretation “I have  but I cannot refer to it”. Sources from Cyprus anyway mention that their radars have not detected any movement and I do not have difficulty sharing this view  as in the Cypriot market Cyprus  Alpha  Eurobank already dominate and there is no “room”.The National plunge and the climate in the ASEThe National share however did not welcome well the results and closed with losses of 4.40%. If you wonder why  the column lists two data points: Q1 had EPS 0.42 euro  Q2 EPS fell to 0.35 euro and Q3 EPS to 0.30 euro. Also Q1 had ROTE 19.1%  Q2 ROTE fell to 15.7% and Q3 ROTE was 13.5%. The general conclusion is that Greek banks are affected by the reduction in interest rates and they do not have strong revenues from other sources to offset and overcover whatever losses from rates. That is why all this battle for insurance  asset management  subsidiaries etc. Their performances move within the range of analyst estimates  but there is not yet a noticeable beat of estimates like happens with foreign banks  something that would show the dynamism of the sector. This weakness they try to cover  combined with the fear of an earlier upgrade of ASE because of Euronext (the probabilities are that HEX next Friday will belong to Euronext) are the reasons the market lately does not feel well.The “dust storm” over DELTA and the bar set highAnd since the discussion came to CVC  let me note on this occasion that again a “dust cloud” was raised in the market regarding the case of DELTA and CVC’s intention to sell it within the framework of the investment exit that it must stage manage. However  as a significant player in food with active interest told the column  the bar remains high. The same seems to apply to the frozen dough segment (Elliniki Zymi – Chrysi Zymi) as well as for the restaurants (Goody’s – Everest) which are under the Vivartia umbrella. In the frozen dough market however it seems we will have new developments since Ideal appears ready to make a move via Barba Stathis  but in something more… small  cheap and compact. Note that under the umbrella of the Barba Stathis Group  before the acquisition by Ideal  was the entire “related” frozen dough segment of Vivartia.HHG merges Ygeia and MiteraThe plan of HHG (Hellenic Healthcare Group) which concerns the evolution of the hospitals YGEIA and MITERA into a single health complex is kicking off. In mid July the Group had prepped the market for the plan of creating a single complex  the largest in the country  with capacity over 800 beds. Now the merger of the two companies proceeds. Based on the merger plan Ygeia absorbs Mitera  with the net position of the latter amounting to 57.6m euros  according to the valuation report. The process includes the issuance of new shares  while the final decision for the merger will be taken by the GMs of the two companies. Operationally of course many Ygeia cases and hospitalizations already take place in the Mitera building. The plan which is carried out at the 50 years of operation of Ygeia includes among others the renovation of the exterior facades of the two hospitals  their functional unification  the shaping of the common exterior areas into a green park etc.TITAN at the port of Le HavreThese days mark three years from the appointment of Marcel Cobuz to the position of President of the Executive Committee of the TITAN Group. The two families who traditionally ran TITAN chose the former head of Lafarge Holcim in Europe  with 20 years experience in the construction materials industry and were vindicated for their decision. Yesterday’s announcement of the Group that it is in exclusive talks for the acquisition of Vracs de l’Estuaire  which has state-of-the-art facilities  at the port of Le Havre  in northern France  came only one day after the announcement of the excellent 9 month results and the jump of the market cap above 3.1bn euros. In the last year  Cobuz’s moves raised the total value of the Group. In February  the Group completed the listing of Titan America on the New York Stock Exchange  raising capital of 393m euros. At the same time  the Adocim unit in Turkey was sold  resulting in Net Debt falling dramatically to 302m euros from 622m euros. Cobuz promoted the renaming to Titan S.A.  creating the TITAN Edge product family (low carbon solutions) and the expansion of TITAN Premier services  while at the same time investing in alternative cementitious materials and in digitization of the production process.The “NATO” of shipping (The Koreans build  the Greeks invest  the US guarantees)Another episode in the saga of “shipping diplomacy” between Washington and Seoul was written this week  with the announcement that Nikos Notias’ SteelShips will build two MR2 product tankers at the K Shipbuilding yard in South Korea – and indeed to US specifications. For the initiated on Wall Street  the news has depth exceeding the displacement of 50 000 dwt of each vessel: it is the clearest indication of the revival of American ambitions for the shipbuilding industry  with Korean know-how and Greek entrepreneurial initiative as catalyst. Notias’ ships are expected to enter the US Tanker Security Program (TSP)  a program that  with the help of tax incentives and government contracts  secures available fleet for military needs. In other words  the Greek shipowner powers up engines to cover not just commercial  but geopolitical needs. From an investment perspective  the move shows smart arbitrage: Notias exploits the Korean cost efficiency  while keeping the advantage of the US registry  a rare mix that offers stable returns in an environment of elevated geopolitical risks and energy transition. This cooperation is not isolated. After President Trump’s visit to South Korea and the announcement of bilateral agreements for modernization of the American shipbuilding base  Washington seems to seek a new “shipbuilding NATO”  where Koreans build  Greeks invest and Americans insure their strategic presence at sea. In the Piraeus scene of course they comment that Notias is not simply the man who builds ships – but who bridges worlds: between an American fleet that is searching for a reason to exist and a shipping that remains global even when it bears national flag. On the Wall Street board such moves are not read only as investments in hardware  but as bets in geoeconomics. And for the moment  SteelShips seems to have set course in the right direction.The buying low  positioning high strategy of ThenamarisThenamaris of Nikolaos Martinos seems to pick up the thread of shipbuilding again  ten years after its last suezmax order. This time though  instead of the Korean yards  the Greek shipowner turned to China and specifically to the state Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding (SWS)  for two new suezmax tankers  158 000 dwt each  at a price close to 81m dollars per vessel. The choice of Chinese and not Koreans  was not random. Information says the Chinese yards offered earlier delivery (early 2028) and more competitive price  as Koreans were asking above 84m dollars per vessel. Thenamaris knows well the “field” of SWS  since only this year it received six LR2 tankers from the same yard  which it had ordered in 2023. Then the cost ranged around 63.5m dollars per vessel – a move which had already shown the company’s turn to China. Not few see this order as a “signal of return” of Thenamaris to the game of big investments  especially after the rumors that the company was discussing  ultimately without result  the acquisition of the LR2 fleet of Frontline of John Fredriksen  worth 1bn dollars. Wall Street would say it simply: Thenamaris is buying low  positioning high.The iron lady from Chios and the entrance of P.L. into tankersOn the other side of the Atlantic the Chios born Angeliki Frangou remains the stable reference point of Greek shipping for New York analysts. The head of Navios Maritime Partners  with the “iron nerves”  closed a deal worth 133m dollars in tanker resales  while most peers struggle to secure financing. Markets see in her the “female Warren Buffett” of shipping – less shine  more resilience. At the same time  Panos Laskaridis  who made a name in reefers and bulkers  invests in tankers. Laskaridis Shipping acquires yet another MR tanker from Chinese Pro Tanker Investment  having already received two vessels from the same yard  wanting to build a modern  methanol-ready force in energy products. The fact that he pays above the average market price (about 48.5m dollars) does not go unnoticed in Wall Street circles: American investors see a Greek who buys not cheap  but smart. In an era where green transition upends shipping data  Laskaridis seems to “read” the momentum. So  while Athens appears indifferent to the backstage of shipping moves  in New York and Hong Kong analysts whisper about a “Greek axis” being rebuilt. And as a trader from Houston commented: “When the Greeks start buying ships above market price  they know something that we still have not seen in the charts.”The tourism company of PapamantellosEveryone involved in energy  and not only  knows Kostas Papamantellos as a key executive of the German giant RWE and as one of the “architects” of the major deal with PPC Renewables for the joint development of an RES portfolio in Greece. K. Papamantellos is the head (President and CEO) of RWE Renewables Hellas  as well as Vice President and CEO of the (joint with PPC) METON Energiaki. Beyond energy  he is opening his horizons toward tourism as well. Thus  he proceeded to set up the company Echinousa Estate Single-Member IKE  with main activity “vacation accommodation services” etc.  with the name obviously pointing to the beautiful island of Kimolos. The initial share capital of the company  which is based in Pallini  is 250 000 euros  which has been paid in by Kostas Papamantellos. For the record: Kostas Papamantellos is the son of Dimitris Papamantellos  who after graduating from NTUA completed a PhD at RWTH-Aachen (from which the son is also a graduate) on metallurgical processes in steelmaking. Dimitris Papamantellos  who passed away in 2015  stood out for his scientific formation  his honesty and his integrity. He had served  among others  as governor of PPC during 1981-1986  Chairman of the Board of LARCO (1986-1989)  Special Secretary of the Ministry of Education for European issues and CSF in 1995 etc. But the grandfather of Kostas Papamantellos also left his mark — he was a military officer and served as aide-de-camp of Nikolaos Plastiras. In fact  during the junta he was imprisoned in the infamous building on Bouboulina street for his participation and the salute he addressed at the funeral of Georgios Papandreou.Attention: Scam (Phishing)There is no end to the attempts of various fraudsters to intercept through the internet the data of unsuspecting citizens. In one of the most recent such phishing operations a govgr logo is used on a blue background and the email is titled “application progress update”. In the… essence  i.e. in the text that follows  the fraudsters are in the… pleasant position to inform us that “after the completed examination of the documents and the tax data that you submitted  the pending reinstatement of your tax minimums has been pre-approved. In order for your application to be completed and to maintain the timely processing of your reversal  you must submit additional control data through our secure online portal within three days from receiving the official notification. This pre-approval means that your tax refund request meets the initial entitlement requirements and can now proceed to the final stage of processing.” Of course  from the linguistic / orthographic errors alone  even the minimally suspicious person understands that this is a scam. Further  there is the access point to the… secure portal with the footnote: “Please ensure that all information you provide is accurate and complete in order to avoid possible delays.” At the end they report that “after you successfully submit all the required data  please wait 14 working days  so that our department can carry out the final check  verification and approval process. During this period your application will be submitted to final compliance checks and approval processes. If you face technical difficulties accessing the secure portal  have questions about the required documents or need help with the submission process  please do not hesitate to contact us.” The brazen text is signed… respectfully by the “Tax Refund Department”… Of course if one notices the fine print  an address is written that refers to Denmark (brescia | Industrivej 13  Viborg  8800 Denmark)  while the email seems to come from Italy. In any case  special attention is needed…Sudden wave of sales at the close of the sessionA sudden massive attack by sellers at the close of the session pushed the General Index from the “safe haven” of 2 005 into the depressing level of 1 998.38 points (-0.8%). Indicative of the “battle” that was given around the fort of 2 000 units is the value of transactions that exceeded 283.9 million euros with blocks exceeding 25.8 million euros. National Bank (-4.4% at 12.6€) starred in the downward movement of the market with transactions worth 55.1 million euros. The drop in National dragged down the entire banking sector  but AlphaBank reacted first and turned -1.98% into a positive +1.4% at 3.48 euros. Eurobank even without the dividend (0.04681€) rose to 3.24€ (+0.75%)  while Piraeus held at 6.79€. VIOHALCO  proud of its subsidiaries  climbed +5.09% to 9.29 euros  while Cenergy (+3.24% at 15.28€) now included in the MSCI index  wrote a new historic high. TITAN (+3.69% at 40.75€) and the energy stocks gave critical support to the General Index. HelleniQ Energy (+1.62% at 7.83 euros) and PPC at 15.95€ showed that they are protagonists of the newsflow  while Intralot exceeded again 1€ (+0.92% at 1.1 euros) helping Intracom (+1.06% at 3.35€) as well.The shipowners  the American ministers and the proposalsI return to what happened at P-TEC  this time with the “shipping”  because the positions of the Greek shipowners who met with Minister Bergam at Zappeion are very interesting. Prokopiou’s proposal in the framework of the Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) was not just an intervention in favor of Greece–US cooperation. The Greek shipowner proposed not to waste time in American plans that will take years to produce results – such as the recreation of a shipbuilding “cluster” in the US. He called on the Americans to utilize the existing Greek shipping know-how and fleet through “preemptive commercial arrangements”  a scheme that combines geopolitical loyalty and economic efficiency. Particularly interesting was his point about shipbuilding orders being placed in Korea  Japan and mainly China. In an era where global trade competition is hardening  Prokopiou reminded that “the floating pipelines” –the ships– do not know borders of production  as long as the interests of the free market and allies are respected.Nikolas Tsakos and the “de-guiltification” of shippingNikolas Tsakos referred to the need to “de-guiltify” shipping. “It is one of the few times we spoke about our industry without feeling guilty” he said  noting that shipowners have often been presented as a necessary but… unpleasant link of the global economy. This observation was not only communicational. It was a political position with economic substance: the head of Tsakos Energy Navigation reminded that 60%-80% of the goods and energy that drive the global economy pass through tankers and bulk carriers. And that shipping  despite the disproportionate weight it carries  remains “the most economical  efficient and environmentally friendly way of transporting large quantities of products.” Recognizing the fragmentation of the sector –“shipowners are not voters anywhere ” he said humorously– Tsakos supported Prokopiou’s logic of realistic approach. He explained that a large part of the Greek fleet is already active in the United States  transporting cargoes for American oil companies  and that “instead of ships going empty all the way to China for maintenance  it would be preferable if they headed to American shipyards  if the right investment framework exists.”Maria Angelikousi and the 10% of US energy exportsMaria Angelikousi captured how Greek shipping has become a cornerstone of American energy extroversion. “We transport 10% of the energy exports of the United States ” she stressed  putting on the table a statistic that Washington can hardly ignore. Her reference to the 700 safe loadings from American terminals was not just statistics. It was a reminder that Greek shipowners are already a critical arm of the American energy strategy. Angelikousi spoke of a “strategic moment” in Greek-American relations and the need to build “deep and lasting bonds in shipping and energy”. She supported the American effort to revive the shipbuilding industry  recognizing however  like Prokopiou and Tsakos  that this process requires time. “We do not expect to go back to the times of Liberty ships ” she said pointedly  reminding that the Greek side is ready to support the US in this transitional stage with ships  know-how and human capital. Angelikousi described in detail a fully integrated model of training and advancement of 9 000 seafarers  with 800 cadets joining the Group’s ships annually.Record number of Wall Street “zombies”The indices on the American Stock Exchange are soaring to unprecedented heights. One would think that this rise in stock values reflects the overall economic activity. The truth  however  is that the number of listed “zombie” companies has also reached record levels. “Zombies” are companies that cannot generate enough profit to cover their interest payments and survive only through continuous borrowing. In October  zombie companies in the Russell 3000 index increased by 83  reaching 639—the highest number since December 2021. Many of the companies that entered the “zombie” category in October come from the health and biotech sectors. These are industries currently hit by rising operating costs and reduced government funding. The pandemic brought a lot of money to these sectors. The post-pandemic era  however  lacks both government support and investment. The previous peak in the number of Wall Street zombies was recorded in March 2021  with 749 zombie companies. Back then  interest rates were near zero  and easy borrowing sustained weak companies. Since then  interest rates have risen significantly and remained high for a long period  making loans more expensive and repayment more difficult. While large companies maintain access to cheaper financing and broader credit lines  smaller companies in the Russell 3000 index are drowning in debt.Deutsche Bank hedges against Artificial IntelligenceBloomberg revealed that Deutsche Bank is planning a new investment risk-hedging strategy against Data Center financing. According to the agency  the German bank is creating a basket that “shorts” stocks related to artificial intelligence. It is establishing investment instruments with synthetic risk transfer as well as default protection. In simple terms  Deutsche Bank is paying substantial amounts to limit potential losses from a possible “burst” of the data center bubble. With synthetic risk transfers  the bank’s credit risk is passed on to third-party investors who are willing to take investment risks  without actually selling the bank’s assets. “Data centers are the new Gold ” say market insiders  as demand for AI infrastructure is currently exploding. Valuations of companies related to Artificial Intelligence and Data Centers have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels  and DB is taking precautions.,positive,0.75,0.25,0.0,mixed,0.18,0.19,0.64,True,English,"['good news', 'shipowners’ quips', 'Motor Oil', 'National Bank', 'new rumors', 'Zappeion', 'agreements', 'strategy', 'plunge', 'Delta', 'American Energy Secretary Chris Wright', 'big foreign energy player', 'bank CEO Pavlos Mylonas', 'corresponding geopolitical significance', 'Cypriot minister Papapastasiou', 'Four major companies', 'police security plan', 'Nuclear Energy Institute', 'old time classic', 'two top ministers', 'The VIP lunch', 'left wing fights', 'stock exchange announcement', 'energy minister level', 'illegal gun possession', 'first instance sentences', 'Motor Oil strategy', 'The 3+1', 'lunch break', 'same time', 'first meeting', 'long time', 'first half', 'American officials', 'National Bank', 'good news', 'long period', 'front stage', 'European ministers', 'commercial agreements', 'international isolation', 'Cyprus–Israel', 'other things', 'GSI cable', 'destabilizing role', 'interesting thing', 'repeat session', 'interesting mobility', 'main face', 'heavy names', 'new data', 'central idea', 'suspensive effect', 'other words', 'serious prosecution', 'heavy weapons', 'K.M', 'Panos Kammenos', 'Theodora Tzakri', 'financial results', 'following phrase', '9 month results', 'main observation', 'high distributions', 'previous quarter', 'dividend distribution', 'persistent questions', 'bank management', '3+1 scheme', 'Aigli Zappeiou', 'Athens center', 'Stavros Papastavrou', 'Petros Pappas', 'SYRIZA–Kasselakis', 'next one', 'party change', '10 basis points', 'Greek presence', 'capital buffer', '30 American', '25 Ministers', '70 basis', 'Newsroom', 'introversion', 'nonsense', 'Greece', 'fate', 'opposition', 'country', 'Mitsotakis', 'rejection', 'Erdogan', 'snubbing', 'Trump', 'tablemates', 'Balkans', 'Zappeion', 'pupils', 'Palestine', 'needle', 'participation', 'place', 'sidelines', 'Conference', 'Turkey', 'suitcases', 'Washington', 'P-TEC', 'guy', 'noon', 'restaurant', 'ACEBA', 'BECHTEL', 'Westinghouse', 'invite', 'forum', 'course', 'kudos', 'host', 'suspensions', 'Crete', 'measures', 'Chrysochoidis', 'Heraklion', 'installation', 'FBI', 'island', 'general', 'light', 'interventions', 'appeal', 'someone', 'jail', 'knife', 'issue', 'Sunday', 'post', 'problem', 'misery', 'centuries', 'politicians', 'Parliament', 'TV', 'fun', 'Giannoulis', 'PASOK', 'errand', 'fours', 'Tsipras', 'something', 'Announcements', 'process', 'ANEMOS', 'context', 'company', 'group', 'concern', 'analysts', 'CET1', 'increase', 'beginning', 'year', 'fact', 'provision', '9 months', 'profits', 'bancassurance', 'column', '2026', '4', '19.0']",2025-11-07,2025-11-08,en.protothema.gr
