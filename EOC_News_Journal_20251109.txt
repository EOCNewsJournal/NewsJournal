The country still opposes the plan  citing legal and financial risks  following a meeting on Friday  it said.The bloc is seeking to raise around €140 billion ($160 billion) to fund Ukraine using Russia’s assets as collateral. The scheme entails Moscow eventually paying reparations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement.The Belgian government is concerned over the lack of alternative proposals from the EU Commission  Euronews said  citing sources familiar with the results of the talks. “For Belgium  it is essential that all options are explored. Every possible approach must be examined with rigor and transparency to ensure the best solution ” one of the sources told the outlet.The bulk of the immobilized assets  estimated at around $300 billion  is deposited at the clearinghouse Euroclear in Belgium. The country previously warned that it could face lengthy and costly litigation if Russia sues it over the seizure.Russia could retaliate by seizing €200 billion in Western assets  including both movable and immovable property  held in Russia by Belgium and countries such as the US  Germany  and France  the nation’s defense minister  Theo Francken  warned last month. He also said the money would be used to extend the Ukraine conflict rather than ending it.Russia has said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft  and that anyone who appropriates them will be “subject to legal prosecution one way or another.”Alternative options  which include joint borrowing or direct grants by the bloc’s 27 members  could have far-reaching consequences for some EU nations  as both of them “would directly affect their deficit and debt ” the Financial Times reported on Friday  citing an EU Commission document.The EU is reportedly expected to make a final decision on the issue at a European Council meeting in December.,negative,0.0,0.43,0.56,mixed,0.21,0.21,0.58,True,English,"['frozen funds', 'EU', 'Belgium', 'Russia', 'media', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'EU Commission officials', 'EU Commission document', 'European Council meeting', 'frozen assets', 'EU nations', 'The EU', 'immobilized assets', 'Western assets', 'financial risks', 'peace settlement', 'alternative proposals', 'possible approach', 'best solution', 'costly litigation', 'immovable property', 'defense minister', 'Theo Francken', 'joint borrowing', 'direct grants', 'reaching consequences', 'Financial Times', 'final decision', 'legal prosecution', 'Alternative options', 'Euronews reports', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Belgian government', 'Friday', 'breakthrough', 'Belgium', 'mind', 'Kiev', 'country', 'plan', 'bloc', 'collateral', 'scheme', 'Moscow', 'reparations', 'part', 'lack', 'sources', 'results', 'talks', 'rigor', 'transparency', 'outlet', 'bulk', 'clearinghouse', 'Euroclear', 'lengthy', 'seizure', 'countries', 'Germany', 'France', 'money', 'theft', '27 members', 'deficit', 'debt', 'issue', 'December']",2025-11-08,2025-11-09,rt.com
53627,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.ekathimerini.com/economy/1286148/euronext-moves-goalposts/,Euronext moves goalposts in acquisition process for Hellenic Exchanges,With 10 days left till the end of the public offer process for the acquisition of Hellenic Exchanges  Euronext felt compelled to change the terms it has set.,With 10 days left till the end of the public offer process for the acquisition of Hellenic Exchanges  Euronext felt compelled to change the terms it has set.Having apparently found it difficult to obtain the minimum acceptance rate of 67% of its shares in the public offer from HELEX shareholders – which also explains the public relations onslaught over the past week – it has reduced it to 50% plus one share of voting rights. This is also allowed by the recent amendment made by the government to the institutional framework governing public offers.During his recent visit to Athens  the head of Euronext  Stephane Boujnah  had rejected the possibility of improving the price (20 shares of HELEX to 1 of Euronext)  in the context of the optional public offer which has been running since October 6 and will be completed on November 17. However  he had not mentioned anything regarding the possibility of changing the terms of the public offer  with the minimum acceptance threshold  67%  being one of the basic ones. Kathimerini then asked Euronext whether there was a possibility of changing the terms of the offer  and the company’s response was that “we remain committed to the offer we have made.”Two weeks later  however  and since the acceptance of the proposal is apparently not progressing as the European group expects  due to the very large dispersion in the shares of the Greek group  it is proceeding with Plan B: The reduction of the minimum acceptance threshold from 67% to 50% +1. Based on the change in the terms of public offerings that the government made in October (and after the public offer had already begun)  Euronext would be allowed up to five days before the end of the acceptance period  that is  until November 12  to “revise” (and not just “improve” as was the case before) the terms of the public offer.This revision  as Euronext notes  offers HELEX shareholders who wish to participate in the public offer an increased possibility of securing the premium offered by Euronext  while underlining Euronext’s commitment to the successful completion of the transaction.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['acquisition process', 'Hellenic Exchanges', 'Euronext', 'goalposts', 'public relations onslaught', 'minimum acceptance rate', 'minimum acceptance threshold', 'public offer process', 'optional public offer', 'public offers', 'public offerings', 'acceptance period', 'Hellenic Exchanges', 'past week', 'one share', 'voting rights', 'recent amendment', 'institutional framework', 'recent visit', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'European group', 'large dispersion', 'Greek group', 'Plan B', 'successful completion', 'HELEX shareholders', 'increased possibility', 'Euronext notes', '10 days', 'acquisition', 'terms', 'shares', 'government', 'Athens', 'head', 'price', 'context', 'October', 'November', 'basic', 'Kathimerini', 'company', 'response', 'proposal', 'reduction', 'case', 'revision', 'premium', 'commitment', 'transaction']",2025-11-08,2025-11-09,ekathimerini.com
