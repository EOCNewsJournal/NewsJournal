It remains unclear whether the option of not bankrolling Kiev was even considered.The potential cost to EU economies is substantial  as servicing a collective loan of that size could result in up to €5.6 billion in annual interest payments. The commission cautioned that borrowing on this scale could also raise general EU borrowing costs and undermine other financial instruments.Kiev expects its Western backers to cover a deficit of nearly $50 billion next year  with its 2026 draft budget projecting around $114 billion in spending and only $68 billion in revenue – nearly all of which is earmarked for military purposes. Most non-military government expenses  including salaries  pensions  healthcare  and education  will rely entirely on foreign aid.Belgium continues to oppose the use of Russian assets as loan collateral  citing serious financial and reputational risks. The frozen funds  totaling around $300 billion globally  with roughly $200 billion held at Belgium’s Euroclear  are technically not confiscated and could be reclaimed by Russia if EU sanctions are not continually renewed.The EU has already stretched legal definitions by classifying the interest generated on the frozen funds as windfall profits not belonging to Russia  and using them to arm Kiev.The new plan hinges on the assumption that Russia will eventually repay the loan as part of a future peace settlement – an outcome Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has described as improbable. On Friday  EU Commission officials once again failed to convince Belgium to back the asset seizure.Russia has said it would regard any use of its frozen assets as theft  and could retaliate by seizing €200 billion in Western assets held in Russia by foreign governments and companies.,negative,0.01,0.35,0.65,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['EU economies', 'Russia', 'assets', 'Brussels', 'FT', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'frozen Russian central bank reserves', 'Most non-military government expenses', 'general EU borrowing costs', 'future peace settlement', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other financial instruments', 'EU member states', 'annual interest payments', 'The European Commission', 'EU Commission officials', 'frozen assets', 'Financial Times', 'joint borrowing', 'serious financial', 'EU capitals', 'EU economies', 'EU sanctions', 'Western assets', 'legal consequences', 'ballooning deficits', 'direct grants', 'national budgets', 'potential cost', 'Western backers', '2026 draft budget', 'military purposes', 'foreign aid', 'reputational risks', 'legal definitions', 'windfall profits', 'new plan', 'asset seizure', 'foreign governments', 'reparations loan', 'collective loan', 'public debt', 'loan collateral', 'members', 'choice', 'economic', 'funding', 'Kiev', 'newspaper', 'Ukraine', 'document', 'month', 'failure', 'consensus', 'Friday', 'option', 'size', 'scale', 'spending', 'revenue', 'salaries', 'pensions', 'healthcare', 'education', 'Belgium', 'use', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'assumption', 'part', 'outcome', 'theft', 'companies']",2025-11-09,2025-11-10,rt.com

Bratislava has refused to send military aid to Kiev  instead calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.Western nations have frozen around $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets since 2022 and used interest from the funds last year to raise $50 billion in loans for Ukraine. The EU is now seeking to raise €140 billion ($160 billion) more using Russian assets as collateral. The scheme is based on the presumption that Moscow would eventually pay reparations to Kiev as part of a peace settlement.EU leaders failed to reach an agreement on the confiscation during a summit in October  effectively postponing a final decision until a European Council meeting in December.In an interview with the Saturday Dialogues show  Fico questioned whether Brussels is seeking to end the hostilities or continue fueling the conflict  suggesting that providing an additional $160 billion to Kiev could prolong the fighting for another two years.“I said this very clearly: the Slovak Republic  as long as I am prime minister  will not participate in any legal or financial mechanisms whose goal would be the confiscation of frozen assets and which are intended to end up as military expenditures in Ukraine ” Fico said.He warned that tapping the frozen funds could trigger billion-euro arbitrations  causing enormous difficulties for EU member states. He also pointed to Belgium  whose government has cautioned that the move could provoke severe retaliatory measures from Moscow.Most of the frozen assets are held at the Euroclear clearinghouse in Belgium. The country has repeatedly said that the EU proposal undermines trust in European financial institutions.Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken warned in October that retaliation from Russia could cost the EU more than $170 billion. “Of course  this money will not rebuild Ukraine but will continue the war ” he added.Moscow has warned that using its frozen assets would amount to theft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said channeling the funds to Ukraine would “boomerang” and that anyone attempting to seize Russian assets would face legal prosecution.,neutral,0.01,0.85,0.14,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['EU member', 'Russian assets', 'seizure', 'Prime Minister Robert Fico', 'Belgian Defense Minister', 'European Council meeting', 'severe retaliatory measures', 'European financial institutions', 'Saturday Dialogues show', 'EU member states', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'financial mechanisms', 'frozen assets', 'EU initiative', 'military expenses', 'military aid', 'peaceful resolution', 'Western nations', 'The EU', 'peace settlement', 'EU leaders', 'final decision', 'two years', 'Slovak Republic', 'military expenditures', 'billion-euro arbitrations', 'enormous difficulties', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'EU proposal', 'Theo Francken', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'frozen funds', 'legal prosecution', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Slovakia', 'prolongation', 'Bratislava', 'Kiev', 'interest', 'loans', 'collateral', 'scheme', 'presumption', 'Moscow', 'reparations', 'part', 'agreement', 'confiscation', 'summit', 'October', 'December', 'interview', 'Brussels', 'hostilities', 'fighting', 'goal', 'Belgium', 'government', 'move', 'country', 'trust', 'retaliation', 'money', 'war', 'theft']",2025-11-09,2025-11-10,rt.com

CNG Fuels is also 60pc owned by private equity group Foresight  with 16 refuelling stations across the UK.Philip Fjeld  co-founder and CEO of ReFuels  revealed the company was considering an Irish expansion during a recent investor update. He said it would make sense to assess the market across the island of Ireland before others.“We continue to have on-and-off discussions there  whether or not that could make sense for us to look at.“We’ve got a quite unique competency  not only in running the stations that you’ve seen  but also in design  build  operational philosophy  the whole package.""Fjeld said there were aspects of such an expansion that would make a lot of sense for ReFuels  both strategically and operationally.“We’ve got customers using our stations across the UK today that also have a home base in Ireland or Northern Ireland ” he said.“So tying that knot together makes sense.""But of course  it needs to also make sense from a financial perspective  a strategic perspective.”Bio-CNG is a renewable form of natural gas produced from organic waste by breaking down materials like food waste and agricultural leftovers through anaerobic digestion.The resulting biogas is purified to remove impurities and increase its energy content  creating Bio-CNG.Suppliers of the fuel claim it emits up to 90pc fewer carbon emissions than alternative heavy fuels.The fuel is already offered in Ireland. In 2024  Flogas opened the Republic’s first-ever dedicated Bio-CNG refuelling self-service station.Last month  ReFuels announced CNG Fuels had entered into a £25m (€28m) five-year debt facility with Foresight Energy to build three new Bio-CNG refuelling stations in Wales and England.By the end of 2028  ReFuels aims to have the capacity to serve 20 000 heavy goods vehicles per day.
