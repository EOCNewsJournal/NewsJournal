So what's the defence strategy?,Belgium is the latest target in a string of mysterious drone incidents across Europe  with some officials directly pointing the finger at Russia. It has left authorities scrambling to boost defences.,"The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech  a technology based on artificial intelligence.Even before at least three drones were reportedly spotted over a power plant in northern Belgium on Sunday evening  Brussels was on high alert.A rash of drone sightings has led to repeated airport closures in the country  stranding thousands of passengers and grounding planes.Belgium is the latest target in a string of mysterious drone incidents across Europe over airports and military sites — and some officials have directly pointed the finger at Russia. It has left authorities scrambling to boost defences.Belgian media are reporting that the drones this weekend were seen over Doel nuclear power plant near the Port of Antwerp. CBC News has not yet been able to confirm these reports.A photo shows the cooling tower of the Doel nuclear plant near Antwerp  Belgium  on Jan. 4  2016. The plant was reportedly swarmed by drones on Sunday night. (Francois Lenoir/Reuters)Unlike the multiple Russian drones that violated Polish airspace in September at the same time as a widespread air attack on Ukraine  there is very little known about the most recent sightings.'Element of whack-a-mole'There is no indication that a ny of the drones involved in the recent sightings have been intercepted or have crashed.“There is a sort of element of whack-a-mole or hide and seek here ” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute and the Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel.“These drones  whoever launches them or wherever they are launc hed [from]  t hey don’t linger  right? They enter ... blocked airspaces and then they’re gone again.”On Sunday  the head of Britain’s military said it was going to be sending experts and equipment to Belgium to help detect and defend against the drones.The head of Britain's armed forces  Richard Knighton  told the BBC that Belgium had asked for assistance  after the airport in Brussels was closed last Tuesday evening for hours as a result of drone sightings.Belgium’s Liège Airport  which is primarily used for cargo traffic  had flights suspended multiple times last week — including on Sunday — after reports of drones.In Germany   where drones grounded 17 flights at the Munich airport in October  authorities are assembling rapid-response teams to counter the threat  which the country’s defence minister has pinned on Russia.A sign with a drone ban is displayed outside the airport in Munich  Germany  on Oct. 6. (Angelika Warmuth/Reuters)In response to a question from a journalist on Friday  Boris Pistorius said he thought Belgium was being targeted because of the ongoing debate about using 140 billion euros ($226 billion Cdn) in Russia’s frozen assets to aid Ukraine. That money is being stored in a Belgian-based clearinghouse called Euroclear.""This is a measure aimed at spreading insecurity  at fearmongering in Belgium: 'Don’t you dare to touch the frozen assets '"" Pistorius said on Friday. “This cannot be interpreted any other way.”Russia dismisses claimsLast month  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called any accusations against Russia for launching the drones unfounded  adding that “numerous politicians in Europe are now eager to blame Russia for any issue.”The frequency of the drone sightings has become “quite unprecedented ” according to Guiseppe Spatafora  a research analyst at the EU Institute for Security Studies.In an email to CBC  he said that while it might be difficult to find direct evidence of Russian involvement  there is a clear “novelty” to the countries experiencing drone disruptions — they have either taken significant steps to support Ukraine or are considering doing so.When air traffic came to a halt in Copenhagen on Sept. 22  Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called it “the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date  ” and that Russian involvement couldn’t be ruled out.After that incident  Danish authorities said that whoever was operating the drones was “capable” and able to pilot them in different flight patterns. Police said at the time that officers decided against trying to shoot them down  given the risk to passengers at the airport and the fuel and planes on the runways.Since the Danish incidents  there has been very little information released about the more recent European sightings  but officials have promised to beef up defences.Crew members aboard a NATO AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) flight survey the skies looking for potential threats  including any aircraft or drones entering NATO airspace. (Briar Stewart/CBC)More NATO patrolsAfter Polish airspace was violated by around 20 Russian drones earlier this fall  NATO announced Eastern Sentry  a mission to step up aerial patrols in Poland using surveillance aircraft equipped with a large radar dome that allows the crew to see more than 500 kilometres in any direction.While the system allows the crew to spot planes and ships at sea  smaller drones are a challenge.WATCH | NATO is on the lookout for drones in Eastern Europe: How NATO is tracking airspace threats over eastern Europe | Duration 4:31 NATO is on the lookout for airspace threats over eastern Europe as suspicious drone sightings continue to shut down airports. For The National  CBC’s Briar Stewart gets a closer look at the Operation Eastern Sentry mission and what it's watching for in the skies“We need to tweak our systems to be able to see those drones  because an aircraft  a normal aircraft  will not have the same radar return as small drones ” said Capt. Joel  an aircraft commander who is only being identified by his full name in line with NATO security protocol.Joel spoke to CBC during a surveillance flight on Nov. 4  where a crew of 28 was focused on monitoring NATO’s eastern flank for any aerial incursions.“The situation in Ukraine proved to us that during a tense situation  man can be creative to find new ways of fighting ” Joel said. ""The concept we had five or 10 years ago evolved pretty quick …we need to evolve as well.”When CBC asked a NATO public affairs officer how the Western military alliance has been involved in monitoring the most recent drone sightings  he replied that the information couldn’t be shared  as it is classified.Police and army inspect damage to a house destroyed by debris after a Russian drone was shot down in the village of Wyryki-Wola  in eastern Poland  on Sept. 10. (Getty Images)Deploying a drone wallEuropean Union officials who have been speaking for months about the need for a region-wide “drone wall” are now vowing to have one in place by 2027.“I wouldn’t call it completely unrealistic  but let’s just call it very ambitious ” said Funk Kirkegaard.He says one of the lessons from the battlefields of Ukraine over the past 3½ years is that it is exceedingly difficult to intercept waves of nimble  relatively cheap drones that can be deployed en masse.He says Europe should instead narrow its focus  and concentrate on protecting critical infrastructure.But he says there are decisions that need to be made about the risk of intervention — like shooting down a suspicious drone in an urban area.“Even if we are able to shoot it down  what happens if it falls on a house?” he said.“These are real-time decisions with a lot of uncertainties.”",neutral,0.01,0.86,0.13,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['Mysterious drones', 'key sites', 'defence strategy', 'Europe', 'Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen', 'Doel nuclear power plant', 'Doel nuclear plant', 'Jacob Funk Kirkegaard', 'Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel', 'large radar dome', 'different flight patterns', 'Liège Airport', 'mysterious drone incidents', 'widespread air attack', 'recent European sightings', 'multiple Russian drones', 'defence minister', 'Danish incidents', 'recent sightings', 'air traffic', 'drone sightings', 'Russian involvement', 'drone ban', 'drone disruptions', 'audio version', 'artificial intelligence', 'high alert', 'latest target', 'Belgian media', 'cooling tower', 'Francois Lenoir/Reuters', 'Polish airspace', 'senior fellow', 'Peterson Institute', 'armed forces', 'Richard Knighton', 'cargo traffic', 'rapid-response teams', 'ongoing debate', '140 billion euros', '226 billion Cdn', 'frozen assets', 'Belgian-based clearinghouse', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'numerous politicians', 'Guiseppe Spatafora', 'research analyst', 'EU Institute', 'Security Studies', 'direct evidence', 'clear “novelty', 'significant steps', 'critical infrastructure', 'little information', 'Airborne Warning', 'potential threats', 'Briar Stewart', 'Eastern Sentry', 'aerial patrols', 'Eastern E', 'Danish authorities', 'airport closures', 'NATO AWACS', 'NATO airspace', 'NATO patrols', '20 Russian drones', 'Sunday evening', 'military sites', 'Sunday night', 'same time', 'Boris Pistorius', 'Control System', 'surveillance aircraft', 'three drones', 'CBC News', 'Crew members', 'smaller drones', 'Munich airport', 'northern Belgium', 'article', 'text', 'speech', 'technology', 'rash', 'country', 'thousands', 'passengers', 'planes', 'string', 'airports', 'officials', 'finger', 'defences', 'Antwerp', 'reports', 'photo', 'Jan.', 'September', 'Ukraine', 'Element', 'mole', 'indication', 'ny', 'sort', 'airspaces', 'head', 'Britain', 'experts', 'equipment', 'BBC', 'assistance', 'hours', 'result', 'flights', 'October', 'Oct.', 'question', 'journalist', 'Friday', 'money', 'measure', 'insecurity', 'claims', 'accusations', 'issue', 'frequency', 'email', 'countries', 'halt', 'Copenhagen', 'Sept.', 'date', 'Police', 'officers', 'risk', 'fuel', 'runways', 'skies', 'mission', 'Poland', '500 kilometres', 'direction', 'ships', 'challenge', 'WATCH', 'lookout']",2025-11-11,2025-11-12,cbc.ca

The leading role was played today by industrial “papers”  in contrast to banks  which acted as a “weight” in a possible more dynamic rise. Investors focused on 9-month corporate results and the end of the US shutdown.Specifically  in Tuesday’s (11/11) session  the General Index gained 8.93 points or +0.44% to close at 2 024.44 points. The index’s range of variation was set at around 10 points  with a daily low of 2 020.52 points and a daily high of 2 030.89 points. The gains of the HA amount to +1.47% within November and +37.75% within 2025.Titan and ElvalHalcor led today’s gains  both recording “jumps” of more than +3%. In the case of the cement company  the high targets set by management for the next 4 years played a key role. GEK TERNA remained on a steady upward trend  which reached an intraday high of EUR 23.5 and reached a 26-year high (January 2000). Meanwhile  Aktor continued its “flights” above 9 euros and renewed its 22-year record (January 2004). Strong gains were also reported for Coca-Cola HBC and Cenergy Holdings.9-month performance and rich business developments in the spotlightBank of Cyprus and Optima bank announced their nine-month financial results this morning. Aegean will follow later  after the close of the trading session. On Thursday 13 November  OTE  HELLENiQ ENERGY and Austriacard Holdings will be next.

It should be noted that the revision of the public offer does not extend the acceptance period  which expires on November 17.Titan is holding an Investor Day in Athens today  during which management will present the group’s new strategic growth plan entitled “TITAN Forward 2029”. The targets for the period 2025-2029 are annual sales growth of 6%-8% with the aim to reach EUR 4 billion by 2029  annual EBITDA growth of 11%-13% to reach EUR 1 billion by 2029  an increase in basic earnings per share (EPS) to EUR 5-6 per share  and total returns to shareholders of approximately EUR 500 million.Tomorrow (12/11) the public offer for Lamda Development’s 7-year bond will start  with the process lasting until Friday 14 November. It is recalled that the aim is to raise EUR 500 million  while the yield range is set between 3.80% and 4.10%.Technological correction in the US – Strong rise in EuropeThe lifting of the US government funding impasse has improved sentiment in global markets. The Senate has given the green light to end the shutdown and now the bill to do so must pass the House of Representatives. If approved by that body as well  it will then be sent to Donald Trump for his signature.Wall Street rose strongly in Monday’s session as the prospect of ending the longest government shutdown in US history brought relief to investors. However  sellers are returning to the US market  with tech stocks coming under renewed pressure  especially those related to the AI sector. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down -0.2% and -0.5%  respectively  while the Dow Jones gains +0.1%.European bourses are on the rise  picking up speed as time passes  with investors digesting the latest developments regarding the US government shutdown.

You might remember our reports (on protothema.gr) about the sewage pollution in Patmos  about the broken wastewater treatment plant that polluted the sea all summer during the tourist season. And also about the taps in the island’s houses that were giving out dirt and mud instead of water. For these reports  we received a fierce attack (oh  come on  the donkey’s tail dripped) from the mayor—he said we were almost Turkish agents—but what’s the result? Well  the Municipality of Patmos got two fines  one €17 800 from the South Aegean Region and one €12 000 from the Port Authority  and naturally  the criminal cases are still pending… but no work has been done yet. In other words  the wastewater treatment plant still isn’t working. For now  the only thing that has been done on the island  my sources tell me  is that municipal fees have been increased.Domestic grumbles-The echo of the energy agreements in Athens is still lingering; some grumbles are circulating in the business circles  but my source told me that complaints should be made… transatlantic  not to the government. Anyway  the same (good) source told me that “all the good ones fit on the road to development and business ” if you catch my drift. For now  the next important meeting  relevant to energy but not only  is Zelensky’s in Athens  expected later this month.Samaras-We also had echoes yesterday from Samaras. My source in the M.M told me that “none of us here  and of course not K.M  even considered for a moment answering Samaras  especially when we saw the interview.” I told you (yesterday too) that Samaras  being an experienced politician  will think carefully about forming a party instead of throwing stones at Mitsotakis  which  by the way  initially fell from… boulders to pebbles and very soon will end up as beach gravel.Farmers’ appointments-Relatively early compared to other times  farmers and livestock breeders from Thessaly  Macedonia  Crete  etc.  are starting their mobilizations today in Athens. The mobilization is by bus  not tractors  but in November they haven’t come down to the capital before. Protests start around 12:00 outside the Ministry of Rural Development  but I hear that Minister Tsiaras is preparing to receive them. After Tsiaras  a planned protest will take place outside OPEKEPE offices  and finally their delegation is expected to deliver a protest resolution to Vice President Chatzidakis  who recently met livestock breeders from Crete.Waiting for the Hyperfund-It’s been circulating for days that some ND MPs are preparing a question about the Hyperfund and its subsidiary companies  in the aftermath of the ELTA case. I understand the tones are somewhat cooling  as MPs don’t want to appear to be opposing the government with back-to-back questions  after the one about the energy market’s operation. Not to mention  there is also coordination with Pierre about possibly holding a more organized briefing for Parliament by the Hyperfund management in the near future.Cypriots are coming-Greece and Cyprus have always been close  even if the relationship sometimes goes through ups and downs. After Mitsotakis’ visit to Cyprus for Glafkos Clerides’ memorial  the Intergovernmental Greece-Cyprus meeting takes place in Athens on Wednesday  which is highly significant. The agenda will  of course  include the GSI cable project  so it will also be an opportunity for clarifications. K.M handled preparations yesterday  while in M.M on Wednesday  Christodoulides and ten other ministers are expected to attend for further matters.National Bank voted for Konstantinos Argyros (and rightly so)-Moving on to market news  I think we wrote about Motor Oil’s plans to sell 49% of ANEMOS; regarding rumors circulating in the stock market about a DEI capital increase  I don’t have any info  so I’ll start—with a note that the column usually doesn’t—with a lifestyle story that also has some business interest. As you know  next June  we have Posidonia. Traditionally  all banks organize a large evening event inviting their shipping clientele. For years  National Bank has chosen the Four Seasons Astir for this event  where last year Anna Vissi entertained the guests in a very successful event  full of fun that lasted late and even dragged some celebrities to try their singing skills in the small hours. Due to last year’s success  and as Vissi is on top form this year  the bank wanted to repeat it. Alas  the singer asked the bank for a €200 000 fee. When National Bank heard the amount  “their ears fell off ” so they booked Argyros instead.Grin-valia-The €55 million losses for 2024 (though expected to be reduced—perhaps significantly—this year) seem to bring major grumbles (sic) at Grivalia Hospitality  starting from the top and reaching the last employee. Rumor has it that the atmosphere within the company is… special  with continual cases of dysfunctional behavior regardless of hierarchy. Even secretaries behave beyond professional limits  considering themselves the second most important person in the company  as was heard recently at the offices. All this creates tensions and is clearly linked to financial performance  as well as high-profile departures like Panagiotis Panagiotidis  head of Grivalia Developments  the company’s construction arm  and months earlier  former CEO Natalia Straf. In any case  Grivalia is struggling to leave behind the negative impact of large new investment ventures  notably the One & Only Aesthesis in Astir Glyfadas. The big gamble  of course  is the Six Senses in the Megalonisos Petalion  a €250 million investment many see as pivotal for Grivalia’s trajectory.European taxes on banks and the Greek “voluntary” model (€750 million and counting)-Matteo Salvini of the Lega  Minister of Transport in Giorgia Meloni’s three-party government and one of the vice presidents  recently found a solution: impose a tax on banks’ windfall profits to raise €5 billion for the Italian State. Similar windfall taxes were imposed in Spain (4.8% surtax)  Hungary (up to 30%)  Czechia (60%)  Lithuania  Romania  and Slovakia  with rates ranging from 2% to 60%. In 2023  Spain collected €1.2 billion  Hungary €640 million  and the Czech government expects €600 million annually. Salvini’s proposal was immediately rejected without praise by coalition partner Antonio Tajani of Forza Italia  Minister of Foreign Affairs and also vice president. In August 2023  Meloni’s government suddenly announced an additional 40% tax on banks’ net interest income. Bank shares plummeted by €9.2 billion in one day—a sum triple the expected tax revenue. Ultimately  Meloni backed down and imposed a 0.26% cap on risk-weighted assets  letting banks double the amount in retained reserves instead of paying. In 2024  Meloni found a gentler compromise to boost budget revenues  postponing certain credit refunds to banks. The European Central Bank warned governments that such a tax raid would hurt weaker banks and make attracting domestic and foreign capital more expensive. In Greece  the government seems to have chosen a cautious  conservative approach  asking banks to voluntarily strengthen social actions and policies. Initially  a €50 million donation for Thessaly disaster restoration  followed by M. Giannakou’s school renovation program with €100 million in 2024 and another €100 million in 2025 (expected to continue in 2026 and 2027). Meanwhile  the government imposed socially minded measures on banks  like cutting ATM and transfer fees in two phases by Chatzidakis and Pierrakakis  reducing system income by €150 million per year  and by year-end banks will need to contribute again via the Swiss franc loan regulation. The total bill  if I calculate correctly  is €400 million so far  with another €350 million on standby  not counting the new Swiss franc package.New funds enter the Greek market-In the Greek market  cases of cooperation between institutional and private capital creating investment funds are increasing  supporting new “made in Greece” technologies and repatriating Greeks who built careers abroad. Periklis Mazarakis  who worked in Boston and New York for the last 15 years  returned to Greece and founded a Greek private equity fund  Golden Age Capital. He raised €200 million with institutional funding from EATE and private investors supporting export-oriented SMEs. Nikos Kalliagkopoulos worked eight years at Prime Ventures in Amsterdam  where he selected and funded high-tech startups (deep tech). He returned to Greece  joined Big Pi Ventures of Veremis/Doxiadis as partner  and now contributes to evolving the fund from Venture Capital to Private Equity. Dimitris Papageorgiou  after ten years in Boston as a researcher at MIT and partner in several startups  returned to Greece and started as Partner at Blue Dome Capital  the first defense fund in dual-use technologies (military and civilian) with €100 million in capital.Temperatures rose at the Shipping meeting with the Competition Commission-Correctly prepared  the Competition Commission appeared at the public consultation for its interim report on Shipping  leaving the best impressions with the participants. However  tensions and… turbulence were not absent in the calm waters of the sector. Both the Secretary General of the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy  Evangelos Kyriazopoulos  and the President of SEEN  Dionysis Theodoratos  found themselves on the defensive  defending the operation of the Council of Maritime Transport. With a sharp statement  shipping analyst and banking executive Giorgos Xiradakis sounded the alarm about delays in new shipbuilding and funding from European programs  pointing out that the “green transition” does not stop  even if the IMO has temporarily hit the brakes. He even warned about the possibility of Europe setting a 10-year age limit for ships entering coastal shipping – as already happens in Japan and China. “If that happens  let’s see who will be left to travel…” he commented. The study’s authors  professors Maria Lekakou and Thanos Pallis  raised issues about port development and restructuring the transport network  even prompting Kyriazopoulos to request… a second speech. The “hot” topic  however  remains the imbalance between high-speed and conventional ships  especially in winter. Some suspect that the stagnation in fleet renewal suits those who want less competition and “frozen” subsidies. The cherry on the cake was added by Xiradakis  denouncing the lack of transparency in state subsidies  which now exceed €150 million annually. “Companies receiving support are not obliged to publish their balance sheets. How can the legislator check where the money goes?” he asked pointedly. And so  the discussion on Shipping generated more… waves than the Commission expected.Personnel changes at the ECB-66% of the ECB’s executive arm  meaning 4 out of 6 executive members  will be replaced by the end of 2027. The most significant changes are those of ECB President Christine Lagarde and Vice President Luis de Guindos  whose term ends in May. At the same time  economist Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel are stepping down  creating new balances within the central bank. Of course  policy at the ECB doesn’t change with personnel  but the extent of the changes may influence certain areas.The ATHEX packages-Packages have begun at ATHEX ahead of the deadline for accepting Euronext’s public offer to acquire 50% plus one share (down from the original 67%) of the ATHEX Group voting rights. Yesterday  a package of 1.4 million ATHEX shares was traded at €6.28. In the coming days  we will see intense activity as the acceptance period  which started on October 6  ends on November 17  with no apparent intention for an extension or change in the price (20 ATHEX shares for 1 Euronext share). Private shareholders remain key  as do foreign institutional investors holding significant stakes  often appearing through major investment banks (JP Morgan  Morgan Stanley  etc.)  Praude controlling 8.12%  and other arbitrage funds.The Venetian lawyer and Euronext-In Paris  they still believe that their proposal to exchange 1 Euronext share for 20 ATHEX shares will achieve broad acceptance  exceeding 50%+1. One of the factors ensuring over 50% acceptance is the investment fund Praude Asset Management Limited  based in Malta. It has already gathered 8.12% of ATHEX voting rights  managed by lawyer Massimo Malvestio from Venice. The Italian ran a large law firm with 40 lawyers and in 2004 founded his own fund  “Hermes Linder Fund SICAV.” In 2009 he founded Praude Asset Management Limited. In 2014  he moved to Malta and became Chair of the Investment Committee of Praude Smart Biz Post. It appears that Malvestio’s shares will add weight to Euronext’s proposal  as he clearly believes that in stock markets  “power lies in unity.”TITAN: The little secret of Le Havre-At today’s Investor Day organized by TITAN management  some analysts may question why the Group wants to buy a loss-making company  Vracs de l’Estuaire. The key word here is one: “Casablanca.” Vracs de l’Estuaire belongs to the Moroccan CIMAT-CIMAF group and started operations at the Port of Le Havre in 2017. CIMAT (Ciments de l’Atlas) produces cement in Morocco with two plants and operates 13 grinding plants in 11 countries across West and Central Africa. TITAN CEO (Chairman of the Executive Committee) Marcel Cobuz  a former CEO of Lafarge Holcim in Casablanca (2015-2017)  knows the Moroccan cement market  competitors (CIMAT)  and logistics from Morocco to Europe inside out. A glance at the map shows that the Le Havre plant is ideally located to serve one of Europe’s largest and fastest-growing markets. It strengthens TITAN’s presence in France  complementing its existing activities in the Marseille market. The Port of Le Havre serves as a cement (clinker) import hub for the European market—the exact model Cobuz knew well from his tenure at Lafarge in Casablanca.Fragkou unloads the old ships-Navios Maritime Partners  under the leadership of Angeliki Fragkou  continues steadily with its fleet renewal strategy  reminiscent of hedge fund moves. This time  it concerns the VLCC Nave Quasar (297 000 dwt  built 2010)  with a reported sale price of $52.5 million  the same as that achieved last month for the sister ship Nave Constellation. The information is supported by brokers in Greece  the U.S.  and the U.K.  while official confirmation from the company is expected. Estimates suggest Chinese interests behind the acquisition  reinforcing the trend of Chinese investment in VLCCs. The sale of Nave Quasar fits a broader pattern: Navios  a “frequent seller” of old bulkers  tankers  and containerships  has sold 47 ships since summer 2022  generating total revenues of around $1.23 billion. In 2025 alone  11 sales have already taken place  totaling $272 million. The VLCC Nave Quasar is the oldest of the five managed by Navios Partners and is on a floating-rate contract  participating in Cosco Shipping Energy Transportation’s VLCC pool  with expiry in December. Navios has around 150 ships in the water and another 25 under construction  including aframax  LR2  MR2  and containerships. Fragkou shows that she’s not just selling ships; she manages opportunities with absolute professionalism  as if viewing shipping through the lens of a trading platform.Fleet expansion strategy for VENERGY-VENERGY Maritime  part of V Group led by Byron Vassiliadis  steadily strengthens its fleet  sending strong signals to the global charter market and investors. Following the recent delivery of M/T ODYSSEAN  the company now owns three modern MR2 tankers and reportedly targets another one soon  confirming its dynamic medium-term growth strategy. Even more significant is the order for four additional Crude Oil/Product Oil/Chemical Tankers at K Shipbuilding  expected for delivery in the first half of 2027. This move is not merely expansion but a strategic positioning in a market where demand for MR tankers and oil products shows resilience despite freight rate fluctuations. From a chartering perspective  VENERGY enhances its negotiating power  also managing CAPTAIN NIKOS and CAPTAIN LEON  allowing coverage of more routes and exploitation of arbitrage opportunities in spot and time charter markets. According to international analysts  continuous investment in modern  high-spec ships with lower operating costs and enhanced environmental compliance makes the company attractive to investors seeking strong cash flows in a sector with limited modern MR tanker supply. Overall  VENERGY moves with strategic planning  combining rapid expansion  fleet stability  and performance outlook  positioning itself as a leading player in the global tanker market.The “fire trio” that lifted the ATHEX-Buyers staged a full comeback at the Athens Stock Exchange  with American wind at their backs due to the agreement in the works to end the U.S. government shutdown. Three blue-chip stocks took center stage thanks to notable gains and new highs: Aktor  DEH  and Viohalco. Deals for U.S. LNG boosted Aktor with gains over 6.5%  marking the best session in seven months. Most importantly  it closed above €9 for the first time in almost 22 years  stopping at €9.1  with the next best close at €9.195 on January 28  2004. DEH solidified above €16  closing at €16.44 and reaching €16.55 intraday  levels unseen since September 2009. Its market cap now exceeds €6 billion  placing it 8th among ATHEX-listed companies  surpassing Metlen. Finally  Viohalco bounced back  erasing Friday’s 1.1% loss and rising 3.3% yesterday  reaching €9.49 for the first time.Where there’s marriage and joy…-It didn’t take much to convince the Athens stock market to overcome its fears and let the banking sector regain the lead. Positive starts in international markets  rising futures on Wall Street  and the sense that Greece is taking a major role in the energy chessboard  combined with Scope’s favorable comments  created a favorable environment to reverse last week’s “correction.” For National Bank  the €0.221 dividend cut was as if it never happened. It closed at €12.7 (+1.28%) on €34 million in trades. However  it failed to reclaim 2nd place by market capitalization  as Eurobank jumped +3.47% to €3.33  with a market value of €12.3 billion. Piraeus followed +2.75% at €6.80  while Alpha closed at €3.45 (+1.02%). The General Index showed positive momentum from the session start and closed near the day’s high  +1.44% at 2 015.51 points  with trading value at €258.9 million  including €55.3 million in packages.Gold doesn’t believe the shutdown is over-In Washington  politicians assure that the multi-day government shutdown is ending after 9 Democratic votes secured a new funding deal. Gold prices  however  express their doubts. Gold is trading at $4 110  just below historic highs. Meanwhile  official data shows that central banks bought 39 tons of gold in September  +79% more than the previous month. Overall  since the start of the year  central bankers have bought 200 tons  trusting the precious metal more than the printed banknotes. Each U.S. government funding deal means more deficit  more debt  and ultimately more pressure on the dollar. U.S. public debt exceeds $35 trillion  with annual servicing costs approaching $1 trillion. Americans pay more in interest than defense spending. Gold at $4 110 does not share the politicians’ optimism—it’s already pricing in the next move.“Building” the new bubble—in copper-As ironic as it sounds  “green technologies” promising to save the planet require massive amounts of copper. An AI data center consumes five times more copper than a traditional data center. An electric vehicle needs four times more copper than a conventional car. Renewable energy grids require five times the cabling. Morgan Stanley warns that 2026 will see the largest copper production deficit in 22 years. They estimate a shortage of 590 000 tons  rising to 1.1 million tons by 2029. The problem isn’t just insufficient production; major mines face structural issues: aging infrastructure  lower high-grade reserves  and regulatory constraints delaying new projects by up to a decade. Global production is contracting for the first time since 2020  just as demand skyrockets. All this signals a surge. Copper prices will remain high not due to speculation  but fundamentals. The 2026 deficit is not a temporary shock—it marks the start of a decade where copper becomes the bottleneck for technological progress. Whoever controls copper controls the future.
