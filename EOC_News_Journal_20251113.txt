This milestone marks a decisive step towards the full commissioning of the site  with construction launched in May 2024 now reaching its final stageAwarded through a public tender in December 2022 and backed by a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA)  this 180-hectare project features more than 180 000 bifacial solar panels  over 350 inverters  and a three-kilometer transmission line. Once fully operational  the plant will generate around 252 gigawatt-hours per year- enough to power 60 000 residents - and avoid more than 140 000 tons of CO₂ emissions annually.Financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with support from the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus  Voltalia has led the project from development through engineering  procurement and construction (EPC) supervision as well as operations  with maintenance planned once the plant becomes operational.Aligned with Voltalia’s mission to provide renewable energy while generating positive environmental and social impact  the Sarimay project includes extensive initiatives such as planting 2.65 million Haloxylon persicum shrubs to restore local ecosystems. Voltalia also supports surrounding communities  including local schools  to promote education and training. At the peak of construction  approximately 776 workers were mobilized on site  85% of whom were local. All activities were conducted in strict compliance with Health  Safety  and Environment (HSE) standards to ensure safe and responsible working conditions.Building on Sarimay’s success  Voltalia is developing a second major project in Uzbekistan: Artemisya  a 500-hectare hybrid complex  with the first phase delivering 100 megawatts of wind power and 100 megawatts / 200 megawatt-hours of storage. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2026  with commissioning planned for late 2027. Artemisya will generate approximately 383 gigawatt-hours per year  further strengthening Uzbekistan’s renewable energy capacity.Robert Klein  CEO of Voltalia  stated: ""The first megawatt-hours from Sarimay marks a major achievement for Voltalia in Central Asia. Successfully completing this 126-megawatt solar project demonstrates our ability to deliver large-scale renewable solutions that benefit both the environment and local communities. We are excited to build on this momentum with our upcoming Artemisya project  which will further strengthen Uzbekistan’s renewable energy capacity and support the country’s energy transition goals for 2030.""Next on the agenda: Q4 Turnover 2025  on January 28th  2026 (post-closing)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in renewable energies.
