He has urged the bloc to keep up the financing by tapping Russian assets  which Moscow has repeatedly said would amount to theft.Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday  Dombrovskis stated that Ukraine was facing a “very sizable funding gap” and additional borrowing would risk undermining its debt sustainability.According to Dombrovskis  tapping Russian sovereign reserves  unlike other alternatives under consideration  would allow the EU to continue channeling funds to Kiev without imposing fiscal burdens on member states. He explained that Ukraine would only need to repay the loan if Russia pays reparations in the future  whereas other mechanisms would require significant budgetary contributions from EU governments.On Thursday  Dombrovskis also announced that the EU had paid out the final €4.1 billion ($4.8 billion) loan to Ukraine under the ERA Loans program which was financed by proceeds from Russia’s frozen assets.Last week  Financial Times reported that the bloc failed to agree on a €140 billion reparation-loan scheme in October. The European Commission had reportedly warned EU members they would face ballooning deficits and rising debt unless they agreed to use frozen Russian assets as collateral. In a document circulated to EU capitals  the Commission estimated that servicing a collective loan of that size could lead to €5.6 billion in annual interest payments.Western nations have frozen around $300 billion in Russian sovereign reserves since 2022  with roughly $200 billion held at Belgium’s Euroclear. Despite repeated efforts by the EU to tap these funds  Belgium has continued to block such attempts  including the current reparation-loan proposal  arguing they would expose the country to serious legal and financial risks and would only prolong the conflict.Moscow has repeatedly stated that seizing its assets would equate to theft and has threatened to retaliate by targeting up to €200 billion in Western assets held in Russia.,neutral,0.0,0.63,0.37,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['EU', 'loans', 'Kiev', 'commissioner', 'final €4.1 billion ($4.8 billion) loan', '€140 billion reparation-loan scheme', 'sizable funding gap', 'significant budgetary contributions', 'annual interest payments', 'current reparation-loan proposal', 'Russian sovereign reserves', 'ERA Loans program', 'The European Commission', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European Commissioner', 'frozen assets', 'collective loan', 'Ukrainian debt', 'press conference', 'additional borrowing', 'other alternatives', 'fiscal burdens', 'member states', 'other mechanisms', 'Financial Times', 'ballooning deficits', 'rising debt', 'Western nations', 'repeated efforts', 'serious legal', 'financial risks', 'Western assets', 'growing concerns', 'debt sustainability', 'EU governments', 'EU members', 'EU capitals', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'Kiev', 'Economy', 'financing', 'Moscow', 'theft', 'Brussels', 'Wednesday', 'consideration', 'funds', 'reparations', 'future', 'Thursday', 'proceeds', 'October', 'collateral', 'document', 'size', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'attempts', 'country', 'conflict']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,rt.com
53678,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/627740-norway-reparation-loan-guarantee/,Norway won’t use own wealth fund to guarantee Ukraine aid,Norway will not guarantee an EU loan for Ukraine with its sovereign wealth fund  Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Kiev’s backers argued that Oslo could help overcome a weakness to the bloc’s proposed “reparation loan” schemeNorway will not tap its massive sovereign wealth fund to act as a financial backstop for a proposed EU loan to Ukraine based on Russian assets frozen by the bloc  Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg has said.Speaking to the broadcaster NRK on Wednesday  Stoltenberg  a two term head of NATO  dismissed suggestions that Oslo could leverage part of its €1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) fund to move Brussels’ proposed “reparation loan” for Kiev out of its present quagmire.The idea had reportedly been floated in Norwegian media and backed by some local politicians ahead of a visit by Stoltenberg to Brussels on Wednesday.“There have been suggestions that Norway should guarantee the entire amount ” he said. “That is not the case. Whether we can contribute will depend on what the EU proposes.”The European Commission is seeking to issue a €140 billion ($160 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium. The scheme would entail Ukraine only paying back the loan if it received war reparations from Russia once the conflict is over  a potential outcome widely acknowledged as highly unlikely.Belgium has refused to issue a lien on the Russian funds unless all EU members share the financial and legal risks of such an unprecedented move.Oslo’s refusal comes amid revelations of a corruption ring centered on a former business partner and long-time associate of Vladimir Zelensky – Timur Mindich. According to Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU)  Mindich  reportedly known as “Zelensky's wallet ” was the ringleader of a scheme through which at least $100 million in kickbacks was extorted from contractors of state nuclear operator Energoatom.Ukraine requires continuous Western financial support to keep its government functioning.

53679,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/627725-rubio-russia-sanctions-options/,US ‘running out of things to sanction’ in Russia – Rubio,US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says Washington has exhausted major sanction options against Russia Read Full Article at RT.com,Washington has blacklisted oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft and now wants Europe to take the lead  the Secretary of State has saidWashington has nearly exhausted its list of viable targets for sanctions against Moscow  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday  following its latest move to blacklist two of Russia’s largest oil companies.In late October  US President Donald Trump ordered new sanctions on energy majors Lukoil and Rosneft  a move that Rubio said was made at the request of Ukraine and its backers.Washington also disrupted Lukoil’s attempt to sell its foreign assets to a Swiss-based energy trader  which the US Treasury Department claimed had ties to the Russian government.“We hit their major oil companies  which is what everybody’s been asking for ” Rubio told reporters. “I don’t know what more there is to do. I mean  we’re running out of things to sanction in that regard.”The top US diplomat added that targeting the so-called “Russian shadow fleet” - tankers that Western governments accuse of transporting oil covertly in defiance of their punitive measures - should now fall to European nations  as “a lot of these are happening in areas much closer to them.”The US and its allies have sought to cripple the Russian economy with sanctions and provide an advantage to Ukraine in the ongoing conflict. However  Moscow maintains that its economy has adapted  redirecting trade to non-Western markets.Meanwhile  Ukraine faces a worsening financial crisis  with reports suggesting that it may run out of cash as early as February without an increase of Western aid. The European Union is pushing for a €140 billion ($160 billion) “reparation loan” to keep Kiev afloat  using frozen Russian sovereign assets as collateral – a move Moscow has condemned as outright theft.Belgium  which holds the majority of the immobilized Russian funds through the clearing house Euroclear  has blocked the proposal  demanding that other Western states share the financial and legal risks.,neutral,0.02,0.87,0.11,negative,0.0,0.41,0.59,True,English,"['US', 'things', 'Rubio', 'US President Donald Trump', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'US Treasury Department', 'top US diplomat', 'Russian shadow fleet', 'Swiss-based energy trader', 'largest oil companies', 'major oil companies', 'other Western states', 'worsening financial crisis', 'The European Union', 'State Marco Rubio', 'The US', 'foreign assets', 'Russian government', 'Russian funds', 'energy majors', 'European nations', 'US Secretary', 'oil giants', 'Western governments', 'Western markets', 'Western aid', 'Russian economy', 'viable targets', 'late October', 'punitive measures', 'ongoing conflict', 'reparation loan', 'outright theft', 'clearing house', 'legal risks', 'latest move', 'new sanctions', 'Washington', 'Lukoil', 'Rosneft', 'lead', 'list', 'Moscow', 'Wednesday', 'request', 'Ukraine', 'backers', 'attempt', 'ties', 'everybody', 'reporters', 'things', 'regard', 'tankers', 'defiance', 'lot', 'areas', 'allies', 'advantage', 'reports', 'cash', 'February', 'increase', 'Kiev', 'collateral', 'Belgium', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'proposal', '€']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,rt.com

53681,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-pitches-eu-joint-debt-as-backup-plan-to-finance-ukraine/,Von der Leyen pitches EU joint debt as backup plan to finance Ukraine,The Commission's preferred plan to use Russian frozen assets for Ukraine is currently blocked by Belgium.,The stakes are high for Belgium because it hosts the financial firm Euroclear that holds the bulk of the immobilized assets  and fears the initiative might create legal and financial risks. The assets were frozen by the EU after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.If the assets plan does not come to fruition  von der Leyen suggested issuing common EU debt that will be eventually repaid by national capitals  as POLITICO previously reported.Another option involves tasking each country to individually fund Ukraine through their national budgets.Both alternatives  however  are unpalatable for highly indebted countries such as France and Italy  which have little means to finance Ukraine.Von der Leyen said during Parliament’s plenary session that using the frozen Russian assets “is the most effective way to sustain Ukraine's defense and its economy. And the clearest way to make Russia understand that time is not on its side.”Her comments to Parliament come as the EU's finance ministers are set to discuss the topic in Brussels on Thursday.The EU is facing pressure to reach a rapid agreement as Ukraine is expected to run out of money next spring.,neutral,0.02,0.84,0.14,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Von der Leyen', 'EU joint debt', 'backup plan', 'Ukraine', 'von der Leyen', 'frozen Russian assets', 'common EU debt', 'financial firm', 'financial risks', 'full-scale invasion', 'national capitals', 'national budgets', 'indebted countries', 'little means', 'plenary session', 'effective way', 'clearest way', 'finance ministers', 'rapid agreement', 'assets plan', 'stakes', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'bulk', 'initiative', 'legal', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'fruition', 'POLITICO', 'option', 'country', 'alternatives', 'France', 'Italy', 'Parliament', 'defense', 'economy', 'time', 'side', 'comments', 'topic', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'pressure', 'money']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,politico.eu
53682,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/kyivs-european-allies-debate-ways-of-keeping-the-cash-flowing-to-ukraine-but-the-picture-on-the-battlefield-is-grim-269541,Kyiv’s European allies debate ways of keeping the cash flowing to Ukraine but the picture on the battlefield is grim,Facing increasing pressure on the front lines  Kyiv is hoping that its European allies can quickly reach an agreement of billions of Euros in funding.,The EU is considering a range of options as it tries to work out how to continue to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia. There are three mechanisms presently under consideration. One is using Russia’s frozen assets to back a loan of €140 billion (£124 billion). Another is borrowing the money at interest  although this is not popular.The third idea  which was proposed by Norwegian economists  is that Norway could use its €1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund – the biggest in the world – to guarantee the loan.It appears that after a day of discussion  finance ministers backed a proposal from the European Commission to use Russian assets.The situation on the front has been largely static for months  although Russian forces have been making small gains in some key areas. The battles for the strategically important cities of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Huliaipole in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia are a good indication of the progress of the war in general.It’s hard  amid the flood of disinformation  to accurately monitor from a distance the exact status of these two important battles. Each day brings fresh reports of multiple attacks and advances by Russian troops. There have also been reports that Russian units have captured Pokrovsk. This would be a serious blow for Ukraine  as it’s an important supply hub  with several roads and rail lines converging there.But the US-based military think-tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW)  which uses geolocated footage on which to base its assessments  has determined that Russia is not yet in full control of Pokrovsk  having to date seized 46% of the city. ISW analysts say Russian military bloggers are “mounting a concerted informational campaign prematurely calling the fall of Pokrovsk  likely to influence the information space”.The battle for Pokrovsk has raged for nearly 18 months now  without resolution – but with huge casualties on both sides.Similarly  while the situation in Huliaipole is deteriorating for the Ukrainian defenders  “Russian forces will probably spend considerable time setting conditions for efforts to seize the settlement”  the ISW says.It’s important to realise that Russian troops initially entered Huliaipole on March 5 2022 within weeks of its initial invasion the previous month  but were quickly pushed back by Ukrainian troops. Fighting has continued in the region ever since.In other words while both sides have made some tactical gains  neither holds the strategic upper hand.One thing is clear: despite the claims and counter-claims  both sides have suffered significant casualties. In June 2025  the UK Ministry of Defence estimated more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the invasion in February 2022. But Russia still retains considerable reserves of troops to call on  and has not yet had to resort to full mobilisation.Meanwhile Russia’s economy is holding up  despite western sanctions. The effect of the recent imposition of oil sanctions by the US has yet to be seen. At the same time  Russia’s continuing and thriving diplomatic  economic and military relationships with its “enabler ally” China  as well as others on the anti-west axis such as Iran and North Korea – which have been supplying Moscow with weaponry and troops  respectively – is helping it sustain its offensive efforts.Institute for the Study of WarFinancing Ukraine’s defenceUkraine  meanwhile  is now almost entirely reliant on continued western support. Since Donald Trump took power in the US in January  the US stance towards Ukraine has shifted considerably and while Kyiv’s friends in Nato can continue to purchase US weaponry for Ukraine’s war effort  the US will not fund any of the purchases. Consequently  military aid to Ukraine has slowed considerably in the second half of 2025 – by up to 43% according to German research non-profit the Kiel Institute.EU leaders voted in October to meet Ukraine’s “pressing financial needs” for another two years and agreed today to use frozen Russian assets to back its loan. This plan comes with a number of difficulties. These assets are held in Belgium by the securities depository Euroclear. But Brussels is wary of the move  arguing that a Russian lawsuit against the move  if successful  could leave Belgium liable.The other obstacle is that it would need to be unanimously approved by EU member states  something that is thought highly unlikely. The idea of using frozen Russian assets has already been rejected by Hungary and Slovakia. And the recent victory of the populist ANO party in the Czech Republic could signal further isolation for Ukraine. One of the first gestures made by the new Czech government has been to remove the Ukrainian flag from the parliament building.What impact is this loan likely to make in the grand scheme of things? The funds supplied thus far have kept Ukraine from defeat  but have not enabled it to strike a decisive blow against Russia that would win the war or enable it to negotiate a just peace.At the same time it is realistic to acknowledge that while a massive injection of funds would help Ukraine stabilise its economy and buy enough arms to give their troops a better chance on the battlefield  it cannot deliver the manpower  weapons or morale. In the end  this latest wave of aid may buy Ukraine time – but it’s unlikely to deliver victory.,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['European allies', 'Kyiv', 'ways', 'cash', 'Ukraine', 'picture', 'battlefield', '€1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund', 'one million Russian troops', 'concerted informational campaign', 'strategic upper hand', 'thriving diplomatic, economic', 'German research non-profit', 'pressing financial needs', 'populist ANO party', 'important supply hub', 'US-based military think-tank', 'new Czech government', 'EU member states', 'Russian military bloggers', 'frozen Russian assets', 'two important battles', 'One thing', 'important cities', 'military relationships', 'military aid', 'two years', 'Czech Republic', 'Russian forces', 'Russian units', 'Russian lawsuit', 'The EU', 'EU leaders', 'three mechanisms', 'Norwegian economists', 'finance ministers', 'European Commission', 'small gains', 'key areas', 'good indication', 'exact status', 'multiple attacks', 'serious blow', 'several roads', 'rail lines', 'geolocated footage', 'full control', 'information space', 'huge casualties', 'Ukrainian defenders', 'considerable time', 'Ukrainian troops', 'other words', 'tactical gains', 'significant casualties', 'UK Ministry', 'considerable reserves', 'full mobilisation', 'western sanctions', 'recent imposition', 'oil sanctions', 'same time', 'enabler ally', 'anti-west axis', 'North Korea', 'western support', 'Donald Trump', 'second half', 'securities depository', 'other obstacle', 'recent victory', 'first gestures', 'Ukrainian flag', 'parliament building', 'grand scheme', 'decisive blow', 'Donetsk region', 'southern region', 'third idea', 'fresh reports', 'initial invasion', 'offensive efforts', 'US stance', 'ISW analysts', 'Kiel Institute', 'war effort', 'eastern Ukraine', 'Financing Ukraine', 'US weaponry', 'range', 'options', 'defence', 'consideration', 'loan', 'money', 'interest', 'Norway', 'world', 'day', 'discussion', 'proposal', 'situation', 'front', 'months', 'Pokrovsk', 'Huliaipole', 'Zaporizhzhia', 'progress', 'flood', 'disinformation', 'distance', 'advances', 'Study', 'assessments', 'date', 'city', 'resolution', 'sides', 'conditions', 'settlement', 'March', 'weeks', 'Fighting', 'claims', 'June', 'February', 'economy', 'effect', 'continuing', 'China', 'others', 'Iran', 'Moscow', 'continued', 'power', 'January', 'Kyiv', 'friends', 'Nato', 'purchases', 'October', 'plan', 'number', 'difficulties', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'move', 'something', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'isolation', 'impact', 'things', 'funds', 'defeat', 'peace']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,theconversation.com

Almost half (49%) are combining in-house development with supplier offerings  and just 15% are buying AI agents off the shelf  said the report.Huge growth to comeThe Capgemini Research Institute estimates that AI agents could bring up to $450bn in economic value by 2028  and with only 10% of banks and insurers deploying AI agents at scale  there is a huge opportunity.“AI agent adoption is poised for rapid growth as 80% of financial services firms are in the [idea] or pilot stage of deployment ” said the report. “However  a sizeable opportunity remains to be unlocked.”Ravi Khokhar  global head of cloud for financial services at Capgemini  said: “Our data reveals widespread industry optimism that the agentic era will open doors to new markets  signalling a new phase of transformation is upon us. To realise this potential  financial institutions must take a long-term view as humans work alongside agents. This means separating substance from hype.”Commenting on the report  Jörgen Olofsson  chief information officer at Euroclear Sweden  said: “AI agents provide financial institutions with significant opportunities to automate repetitive tasks  improve customer and business support functions  and boost operational scalability.”To date  the survey found that 75% of banks use cloud-native AI agents for customer services  64% for fraud detection  64% for loan processing and 59% for customer onboarding.In the insurance sector  70% use AI agents for customer service  68% for underwriting  65% for claims processing and 58% for customer onboarding.Jesse Antosiewicz  senior director of technology at Liberty Mutual Insurance  who took part in the survey  said: “AI is already delivering measurable improvements in customer experience. From faster processing to more intuitive interactions  the technology is reshaping how services are delivered and how customers engage with the brand.”Another survey respondent  William Tong  senior vice-president of the business technology payments service at Capital One  said: “Agentic AI is gaining trust in customer-facing roles as firms strengthen policies and governance. Opportunities lie in accelerating long processes such as onboarding customers  merchants and partners  shrinking cycle times to transform efficiency and elevate the overall customer experience.”AI babysittersDespite AI’s widespread use  the survey found that about half of banks and insurers are creating AI supervisor roles as 92% of executives admit to a lack of relevant skills among business leaders. AI agent supervisor and coordinator roles are being created by 48% of those interviewed.As well as creating AI agent supervisory roles  46% of banks and insurers are reskilling employees and reallocating them to different divisions according to skill sets.Lloyd Scholz  chief technology officer at insurer Markel  said: “Maintaining a human-in-the-loop remains crucial  especially in regulated settings. Trust  explainability and governance are vital components in deploying AI agents  ensuring that automation supports rather than replaces human judgment.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.92,0.08,0.0,True,English,"['AI agent development', 'finance firms', 'Two-thirds', 'suppliers', 'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group', 'The Capgemini Research Institute', 'artificial intelligence (AI) agents', 'AI agent supervisory roles', 'business technology payments service', 'Jörgen Olofsson', 'chief information officer', 'business support functions', 'AI agent adoption', 'widespread industry optimism', 'Liberty Mutual Insurance', 'chief technology officer', 'AI supervisor roles', 'proprietary AI agents', 'cloud-native AI agents', 'health insurance provider', 'overall customer experience', 'World cloud report', 'financial services firms', 'customer service', 'business leaders', 'customer-facing roles', 'coordinator roles', 'insurance companies', 'financial institutions', 'insurance sector', 'widespread use', 'AI expertise', 'AI platform', 'agentic AI', 'Sakana AI', 'AI babysitters', 'cloud-based platforms', 'largest bank', 'AI-native company', 'key partnerships', 'supplier offerings', 'Huge growth', 'economic value', 'huge opportunity', 'rapid growth', 'pilot stage', 'sizeable opportunity', 'Ravi Khokhar', 'global head', 'agentic era', 'new markets', 'new phase', 'long-term view', 'Euroclear Sweden', 'repetitive tasks', 'operational scalability', 'fraud detection', 'loan processing', 'customer onboarding', 'claims processing', 'Jesse Antosiewicz', 'senior director', 'measurable improvements', 'faster processing', 'intuitive interactions', 'William Tong', 'senior vice-president', 'Capital One', 'long processes', 'cycle times', 'relevant skills', 'different divisions', 'skill sets', 'Lloyd Scholz', 'insurer Markel', 'regulated settings', 'vital components', 'human judgment', 'external partners', 'house development', 'significant opportunities', 'survey respondent', 'Banks', 'suppliers', 'Two-thirds', '1,000 respondents', 'example', 'Vitality', 'Google', 'launch', 'millions', 'people', 'decisions', 'lifestyle', 'Japan', 'MUFG', 'data', 'OpenAI', 'shelf', 'insurers', 'scale', 'deployment', 'doors', 'transformation', 'potential', 'humans', 'substance', 'hype', 'date', 'underwriting', 'customers', 'brand', 'trust', 'policies', 'governance', 'merchants', 'efficiency', 'half', 'executives', 'lack', 'employees', 'loop', 'explainability', 'automation']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,computerweekly.com

Ubisoft requests that Euronext (a European exchange market) to halt trading until further notice.The publisher's statement reads:Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26. Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38  FR001400MA32  and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14  2025  until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.The suspension will remain in place until the company publishes the delayed results ""in the coming days""  Ubisoft announced in said in a statement shared with both Reuters and posted online to various social media channels.The motives for why the company has made this move are currently unclear.

Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year  Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing  postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results.No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided  but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling.There's no sign that's the case here  but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet  and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new ""creative house"" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed  Far Cry  and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that  though  was something of a low-key power struggle: Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft  but the founding Guillemot family was reluctant to let go of the wheel.The deal reached in March left the existing Ubisoft power structure in place—Charlie Guillemot  son of Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot  is co-chief of the new venture  make of that what you will—but as we noted when Vantage Studios was formally christened  it's a name and not much more at this point  and there's still plenty of room for things to go wrong.It seems clear that  at the very least  things aren't going exactly right  but beyond that it's pure speculation. Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad  who specializes in the videogame markets in Asia and MENA  said on Bluesky that the postponement ""could indicate a major announcement related to the company.""(Image credit: Daniel Ahmad (Bluesky))Ahmad added that the results pause ""could imply an acquisition of sorts""—someone making a surprise move on the Ubisoft rubble  possibly—but it could just as easily be an ""accounting/financial issue.""

Nov. 13  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases  today announced advancements for its next-wave Curadigm Nanoprimer platform.The Curadigm Nanoprimer is designed to address one of the most universal challenges in modern medicine—the effective extrahepatic delivery of innovative therapeutic agents that are administered intravenously (“IV”) such as RNA-based vaccines  peptide-based vaccines  and oncolytics viruses. Built from precisely engineered lipid-based nanoparticles  the Nanoprimer is intended to transiently occupy liver pathways responsible for therapeutic clearance. By doing so  the Nanoprimer enables a greater fraction of subsequently administered therapeutic agents to reach their intended target tissues  potentially improving efficacy or reducing liver-related toxicity.Nanobiotix expects the Curadigm Nanoprimer platform to function as a significant driver of long-term growth for the Company  with plans for proprietary internal development of a suite of Nanoprimer products and building momentum for the Nanoprimer platform as a hub for external collaboration.Four New Patent Applications Filed to Expand Intellectual Property Foundation and Fuel Business Development ActivityBuilding on a strong intellectual property foundation  Nanobiotix has filed four new patent applications to cover the Curadigm platform and several potential product applications. Taken together with the intellectual property protections already in place  these filings aim to support the further exploration of the Curadigm platform as a hub for external collaboration as well as the creation of an initial proprietary pipeline.“We believe the Curadigm Nanoprimer platform has broad potential to redefine the way drugs can be designed and developed ” said Laurent Levy  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Board at Nanobiotix. “Our new patent applications aim to further strengthen Curadigm’s intellectual property foundation as both a collaboration platform and as the backbone of a proprietary product pipeline developed internally. With potential applications across several therapeutic areas  the Curadigm Nanoprimer is well positioned to help solve the extrahepatic delivery challenges that limit the potential of innovative therapeutic classes  create new pathways to address the unmet needs of patients  and fuel long-term growth for Nanobiotix.”First Preclinical Therapeutic Vaccine Combo Data Establishing In Vivo Proof-of-Concept for Cancer Treatment and BeyondAt the 2025 Partnership Opportunities in Drug Delivery conference (PODD)  Nanobiotix presented new in vivo preclinical data evaluating the Nanoprimer in combination with nucleic acid-based and peptide-based therapeutic vaccines.Title: Nanoprimer Technology for Enhanced Therapeutic Delivery: Outsmarting the Liver BarrierSession: Cell  Gene  & Novel Biologics DeliveryPresenter: Julie Devalliere  PhD  Nanobiotix Senior BiologistKey findings included:Boosted acute immune response following vaccination with mRNA lipoplex vaccinesImproved memory immune response with mRNA lipoplex vaccinesSimilar results observed with peptide-based vaccinesNanobiotix believes these data establish a new potential pathway for IV-administered therapeutic vaccines in several therapeutic areas including oncology. The findings will serve as the foundation for the Company’s initial proprietary pipeline of Nanoprimer products.“Extrahepatic delivery is a persistent barrier that has prevented potentially gamechanging therapies from improving outcomes for patients in need ” said Matthieu Germain  Head of the Curadigm platform at Nanobiotix. “The new therapeutic vaccine combo data presented at PODD 2025 supports our hypothesis that the Curadigm Nanoprimer could bring a novel approach to unlocking new pathways for IV-administered peptide-based and nucleic acid-based product candidates.”Building Momentum for Strategic CollaborationsThe Curadigm Nanoprimer platform has broad potential for development in combination with IV-administered therapeutic agents. In parallel with establishment of its internal proprietary pipeline  Nanobiotix is actively pursuing collaboration pathways and currently has numerous material transfer agreements in place with biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners who are conducting exploratory evaluations of Nanoprimer combinations.Manufacturing Activities in MotionChemistry  Manufacturing  and Controls (CMC) activities for the Curadigm Nanoprimer are progressing in alignment with Nanobiotix’s development roadmap for both its internal pipeline and external collaborations.About CURADIGMCuradigm is an early-stage nanotherapeutic platform designed to disrupt the design and development of intravenously(IV)-administered therapeutics and improve outcomes for patients.

To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay  we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.Thanks for your understanding.Fred""Original Story:Suddenly  and just 15 minutes before the financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year were meant to go live  Ubisoft not only delayed the release of its results but also halted the trading of its shares and bonds ahead of the market opening tomorrow on November 14  2025.There's been no comment from Ubisoft explaining the delay or why it stopped trading its shares and bonds  but such a sudden stoppage and delay don't exactly indicate that everything is smooth sailing at the company. What it does indicate is that there's likely something major going on within the company right now  potentially something as major as an acquisition.Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38  FR001400MA32  and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14  2025  until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days "" the company said in a statement. ""Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.""Ubisoft just postponed its earnings report and halted the trading of its shares. Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company. pic.twitter.com/MRhTNYykIZ — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) November 13  2025It's no secret that Ubisoft has had a turbulent few years. Beyond several instances of layoffs at the company  it had a few of its big titles in recent years result in big commercial misses  with its one saving grace being the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows.The new subsidiary that it opened alongside Tencent  officially called Vantage Studios  is seemingly a result of its commercial woes  since it included a major investment from Tencent  and  specifically for the company's chief executive officer  Yves Guillemot  allowed the Guillemot family to retain control of the company and held off calls for the company to go private.But those calls might not have been held off for long  since this sudden delay could very well be due to Ubisoft getting set to announce that it has been acquired  either by Tencent or by another large entity. We know that there have been discussions about a Ubisoft buyout following the struggles it has had recently  and now that EA has begun that process with the Saudi Arabia PIF and the Consortium of private equity investors  it could have been that Ubisoft shareholders used EA's purchase as fuel to campaign for Ubisoft to be acquired.For now  this is all just speculation  but the sudden nature of the results release being delayed and the stoppage of trading  on top of everything else that has been going on with Ubisoft in the last few years  point to a major shift in the company due to be announced within the coming days. Or it could be nothing  we'll see.Follow Wccftech on Google to get more of our news coverage in your feeds.",neutral,0.12,0.88,0.0,mixed,0.21,0.15,0.64,True,English,"['First-Half 2025-26 Results', 'Ubisoft Delays', 'Release', 'Acquisition', 'Update', '2025-26 fiscal year', 'one saving grace', 'chief executive officer', 'Saudi Arabia PIF', 'private equity investors', 'chief financial officer', 'big commercial misses', 'first-half 2025-26 results', 'first-half earnings results', 'big titles', 'commercial woes', 'financial results', 'internal email', 'Frederick Duguet', 'full email', 'coming days', 'legal regulations', 'media coverage', 'conference call', 'Investor section', 'detailed view', 'Original Story', 'first half', 'smooth sailing', 'major announcement', 'Daniel Ahmad', 'several instances', 'Creed Shadows', 'new subsidiary', 'major investment', 'Yves Guillemot', 'Guillemot family', 'large entity', 'sudden nature', 'major shift', 'news coverage', 'unnecessary speculation', 'short delay', 'sudden delay', 'extra time', 'earnings report', 'results release', 'sudden stoppage', 'recent years', 'Ubisoft buyout', 'Ubisoft shareholders', 'market volatility', 'market opening', 'Update', 'Insider-Gaming', 'trading', 'closing', 'semester', 'tonight', 'information', 'Euronext', 'stock', 'questions', 'site', 'understanding', 'shares', 'bonds', 'November', 'comment', 'everything', 'company', 'something', 'acquisition', 'FR001400DV38', 'FR001400MA32', 'FR0014000O87', 'publication', 'statement', 'point', 'MRhTNYykIZ', 'ZhugeEX', 'secret', 'turbulent', 'layoffs', 'success', 'Assassin', 'Tencent', 'control', 'calls', 'discussions', 'struggles', 'process', 'Consortium', 'purchase', 'fuel', 'campaign', 'last', 'Wccftech', 'Google', 'feeds']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,wccftech.com

Settlement and delivery of the Offering is expected on November 17  2025  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.About the OfferingThe offering price per ADS of $3.85 (corresponding to €3.33 per ordinary share based on the exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.1576 as published by the European Central Bank on November 12  2025) is equal to the volume-weighted average price of the share of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (""Euronext"") for the last trading session preceding the pricing date of the Offering  less a discount of 0.89%. The offering price was determined by the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with a sub-delegation of powers from the Company’s Board of Directors (Conseil d'Administration) on October 27  2025  pursuant to the 25th resolution of the Company’s combined shareholders’ meeting held on May 22  2025 (the ""General Meeting"").Leerink Partners and Piper Sandler are acting as underwriters for the Offering. Namsen Capital is acting as Equity Capital Markets Advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering.The Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement that was entered into on November 12  2025 in connection with the determination of the offering price. The underwriting agreement does not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).The ADSs sold in the Offering by way of a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights will be issued in accordance with the 25th resolution of the General Meeting through a public offering (to the exception of public offerings defined in Article L.411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code) in the United States only.In connection with the Offering  the Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 5 844 155 additional ADSs  representing 15% of the ADSs sold in the Offering  on the same terms and conditions as in the Offering  pursuant to the 30th resolution adopted at the General Meeting (the ""Underwriters’ Option""). The Company will announce the exercise of the Underwriters’ Option  if any  and the number of ADSs to be issued in connection therewith  if any  as soon as practicable thereafter in a subsequent press release.Piper Sandler  acting as stabilization agent  may effect transactions with a view to supporting  stabilizing  or maintaining the market price of such securities at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the Company’s ADSs market. However  there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and  if begun  such stabilization action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Market.The aggregate net proceeds from the Offering are expected to be approximately $140.1 million (€121.0 million)  after deducting underwriting fees  commissions and estimated expenses payable by the Company  assuming no exercise of the Underwriters’ Option in connection with the Offering. If the Company issues additional ADSs pursuant to the exercise in full of the Underwriters’ Option  the estimated net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering would be expected to be approximately $161.2 million (€139.3 million)  after deducting underwriting fees  commissions and estimated expenses payable by the Company.The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering (also in the event that the Underwriters' Option is exercised in full)  together with existing cash and cash equivalents  as follows:approximately 80% to fund the continuation of the Company’s NATiV3 Phase 3 clinical trial as well as the continuation of the preparation and initiation of the outcome trial and for commercialization activities; andapproximately 20% to fund the working capital and for general corporate purposes of the Company.As of September 30  2025  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €97.61 million and short-term deposits2 convertible in a period exceeding 3 months of €24.71 million. As of the date of this press release  based on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits as of September 30  2025  considering its current cost structure and projected expenditure commitments  the Company estimates that  prior to the issuance of the ADSs  its cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits would enable it to finance its operations as currently planned until the end of the third quarter of 20263  which will not be sufficient to meet its obligations over the next 12 months4.Based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits as of September 30  2025  following the issuance of the ADSs  the Company expects to be able to finance its operations as currently planned:until the beginning of the first quarter of 2027 (based on net proceeds of €121.0 million ($140.1 million) excluding the exercise of the Underwriters' Option) and until the end of the first quarter of 2027 (based on net proceeds of €139.3 million ($161.2 million) if the Underwriters' Option is exercised in full)  assuming no exercise of the Tranche 3 warrants issued in the structured financing announced by the Company on October 14  2024; anduntil the beginning of the third quarter of 2027 (based on net proceeds of €121.0 million ($140.1 million) excluding the exercise of the Underwriters' Option) and until the middle of the third quarter of 2027 (based on net proceeds of €139.3 million ($161.2 million) if the Underwriters' Option is exercised in full)  if the Tranche 3 warrants issued in the structured financing announced by the Company on October 14  2024 are exercised in full for proceeds of up to €116.0 million.These estimates are based on the Company’s current business plan and exclude any potential milestones payable to or by the Company and any additional expenditures related to other product candidates or resulting from the potential in licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies  or any associated development the Company may pursue. The Company may have based these estimates on assumptions that are incorrect  and the Company may end up using its resources sooner than anticipated. There can be no assurance that the Offering will be completed or whether  and to which extent  the Tranche 3 warrants will be exercised  if at all.Samsara BioCapital L.P.  which holds approximately 5.7% of the share capital and approximately 5.2% of the voting rights of the Company as of the date hereof and not taking into account the Offering  subscribed to 5 194 805 ADSs for an amount of approximately $19 999 999.20.

Photograph: iStockNon-executive directors in the financial service sector earn twice as much as counterparts in other businesses  research shows.The findings come from a survey carried out by the Institute of Directors on the remuneration of non-executive board directors and on attitudes on governance issues.The median pay for non-executive directors in financial services businesses was €60 000 to €70 000. In other sectors  it was between €30 000 and €35 000.The study found wide variance between the pay for non-executive directors and chairpersons of companies listed on Euronext Dublin.The highest pay for a board chair on a Dublin-listed company was €422 000  more than 90 per cent higher than the average pay of just over €220 000.The lowest-paid chairperson among the 20 largest Dublin-listed companies received €65 000.Non-executive directors at these listed companies received significantly less  with remuneration ranging €55 000 to €97 000. The average was just above €70 000.Most of directors  totalling 70 per cent  felt their remuneration was a fair reflection of their responsibilities and time commitments.The survey also found strategy and risk management remained the top-rated core competencies prioritised by boards  with artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI skills emerging as increasingly demanded expertise.The survey highlighted a move away from the traditional quarterly board meeting cycle  with most directors attending at least five board meetings a year. They also cited an increased number of committee meetings and said regulatory expectations were increasing their workload.Of the 231 respondents  who between them held 385 directorships  66 per cent made less than €35 000. Slightly more than half (56 per cent) held positions in the financial services sector.Just over two-thirds  68 per cent  of these directors had more than six years of experience as directors.

Photo: MaxwellsJohn Hennessy  a former partner with Arthur Andersen  senior counsel  part-time lecturer and experienced non-executive  ticked all the boxes when he was announced this week as the incoming chairman of agri-services group Origin Enterprises.“John’s appointment as chair-designate of the board marks an exciting new chapter for Origin ” the group’s chief executive  Sean Coyle  said.“He brings a wealth of experience  and I am confident that his stewardship will be instrumental in guiding the board as we execute the next phase of our growth strategy.”But it’s an anointment that’s likely to send a chill through the ranks of executives at Euronext Dublin  which runs the Irish Stock Exchange.For Hennessy has presided over the sales of two Irish public limited companies over the past five years as chairman of recruitment group CPL Resources and more recently Dalata Hotel Group when they waved goodbye to the stock market.They are among a number of high-profile companies  including CRH  Smurfit Kappa (now Smurfit Westrock) and Flutter  that have departed the Irish exchange in recent years – a period that has also been marked by a dearth of initial public offerings (IPO).Mr Hennessy hired Rothschild in March to help with a strategic review of the Dalata  best known for its Clayton and Maldron hotel brands.It did the trick and flushed out a number of interested parties. A €1.4 billion takeover agreement was struck in July with Oslo-based investment firm Eiendomsspar and Swedish hotel company Pandox. It marked a 35.5 per cent premium to Dalata’s market value before the review was launched.Dalata delisted from exchange on Monday after the sale was sealed.This month five years ago  Mr Hennessy agreed to sell off CPL Resources to Japan’s Outsourcing Group in a deal worth €317.8 million – a 36 per cent premium over the company’s prices before the announcement was made.Shares in Origin have barely moved since the now 69-year-old was announced as its incoming chairman.But is it only a matter of time before Hennessy’s track record sparks Origin bid speculation in the market?,neutral,0.09,0.87,0.04,positive,0.64,0.36,0.0,True,English,"['new chairman', 'Origin', 'eyebrows', 'sales', 'CPL', 'Dalata', 'two Irish public limited companies', 'Swedish hotel company Pandox', 'agri-services group Origin Enterprises', 'initial public offerings', 'Maldron hotel brands', 'exciting new chapter', '€1.4 billion takeover agreement', 'Oslo-based investment firm', '35.5 per cent premium', '36 per cent premium', 'past five years', 'Origin bid speculation', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Dalata Hotel Group', 'high-profile companies', 'Irish exchange', 'recruitment group', 'recent years', 'Outsourcing Group', 'stock market', 'former partner', 'Arthur Andersen', 'senior counsel', 'part-time lecturer', 'Sean Coyle', 'next phase', 'growth strategy', 'Euronext Dublin', 'CPL Resources', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'interested parties', 'track record', 'For Hennessy', 'Mr Hennessy', 'market value', 'John Hennessy', 'recent sale', 'Clayton brand', 'incoming chairman', 'chief executive', 'strategic review', 'owner', 'Photo', 'Maxwells', 'boxes', 'appointment', 'chair-designate', 'board', 'wealth', 'experience', 'stewardship', 'anointment', 'chill', 'ranks', 'executives', 'sales', 'goodbye', 'number', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'period', 'dearth', 'IPO', 'Rothschild', 'March', 'trick', 'July', 'Eiendomsspar', 'Monday', 'Japan', 'deal', 'prices', 'announcement', 'Shares', 'matter']",2025-11-13,2025-11-14,irishtimes.com

The strategy identified a funding need of DKK 60–70 million to support the completion of the U.S. clinical study for adults and to further strengthen BioPorto’s commercial platform. A range of financing alternatives – including equity issuance and other strategic financing solutions – were evaluated to ensure robust support for the Company’s long-term growth and operational objectives.The Board of Directors has now executed the first step of this strategy by initiating this private placement of up to 40 438 426 new shares at market price. The Offering is fully pre-subscribed  with advance indications received for the entire amount  and is expected to raise gross proceeds of approximately DKK 43 million.Jens Due Olsen  Chair of the Board of BioPorto  commented: “We greatly appreciate the strong support from both existing shareholders and new institutional and private investors  supplemented by a strong commitment from BioPorto’s Board and management. The private placement provides the financial flexibility to advance our strategic priorities  including completing data collection  submitting a pre-submission to the FDA  and initiating the Validation Study in BioPorto’s U.S. clinical trial  while strengthening our commercial platform. In determining the size of this placement  the Board considered the Company’s range of future financing options  primarily in the form of potential divestments of non-core assets supplemented with credit facilities. The decision taken ensures a balanced and prudent funding structure while covering the projected spending throughout 2026 and thereby positions the Company strongly for its journey towards positive cash flow in the second half of 2027.”Key Terms of the OfferingThe Offering is made as a cash share capital increase directed at a limited group of shareholders  institutional and financial investors without pre-emptive subscription rights for the Company’s existing shareholders in accordance with the authorization stipulated in Article 17e and 17f of BioPorto’s Articles of Association.The Offering comprises up to 40 438 426 new shares of nominally DKK 1 each  equivalent to 8.89% of BioPorto’s registered share capital prior to the share capital increase.The subscription price is DKK 1.072  which corresponds to the closing price of BioPorto shares traded on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S on 13 November 2025.

In all these approvals  the CPT code 64568 was acceptedRevenue for the third quarter of 2025 was €2.0 million  representing 56% year over year growth  compared to €1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024Cash  cash equivalents and financial assets were €22.5 million on September 30  2025  compared to €43.0 million at the end of June 30  2025.“The first weeks post FDA approval have been a huge success. We already completed the first implants in September. The response from physicians has been overwhelmingly positive  driven by the excitement of finally having real optionality in hypoglossal nerve stimulation for OSA patients ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah's Chief Executive Officer. “We also secured reimbursement and generate the first U.S. revenue within the first month post FDA approval. The financing transaction announced today will support our sustained growth in the U.S. market. The momentum and enthusiasm couldn’t be greater.”Strong Initial U.S. Commercial LaunchThe Company is executing its focused two-pronged launch strategy  targeting high-volume hypoglossal nerve stimulation implanting centers while developing strong referral networks with sleep physicians. The first commercial Genio devices were implanted at Townsend Memorial Health System in Houston  Texas  where the surgeon completed five procedures in the first week.As of October 31  the Company has trained 111 surgeons on the Genio system  and 9 accounts implanted Genio. The Company has completed 102 value analysis committee submissions  with 35 approvals received  and has submitted 63 prior authorizations through their Genio Access Program (GAP)  of which 21 approvals have been received. These metrics reflect the strong early traction the Company is seeing in the market and demonstrate the execution of its focused launch strategy.Reimbursement ProgressThe Company continues to make significant progress towards widespread reimbursement coverage with major payor policy updates and strategic partnerships that streamline patient access to the Genio system.

While coverage for hypoglossal nerve stimulation was already established  the inclusion of this code provides additional clarity for providers and payors  which the Company expects will help reduce administrative barriers and streamline patient access. HCSC and BCBS of Michigan represent over 26 million members across six states.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS (unaudited)(in thousands)For the three months ended September 30For the nine months ended September 302025202420252024 Revenue1 9721 2664 3763 258 Cost of goods sold( 779)( 482)(1 675)(1 217) Gross profit€ 1 193€ 784€ 2 701€ 2 041 Research and Development Expense(12 911)(7 902)(31 959)(22 573) Selling  General and Administrative Expense(12 702)(8 042)(35 765)(20 396) Other income/(expense)51180166430 Operating loss for the period€ (24 369)€ (14 980)€ (64 857)€ (40 498) Financial income1 0821 1386 5614 615 Financial expense( 583)(3 043)(8 162)(5 480) Loss for the period before taxes€ (23 870)€ (16 885)€ (66 458)€ (41 363) Income taxes290( 173)( 114)( 724) Loss for the period€ (23 580)€ (17 058)€ (66 572)€ (42 087)Loss attributable to equity holders€ (23 580)€ (17 058)€ (66 572)€ (42 087) Other comprehensive lossItems that may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss (net of tax)Currency translation differences( 33)( 209)197( 221) Total comprehensive loss for the year  net of tax€ (23 613)€ (17 267)€ (66 375)€ (42 308) Loss attributable to equity holders€ (23 613)€ (17 267)€ (66 375)€ (42 308)Basic Loss Per Share (in EUR)€ (0.630)€ (0.496)€ (1.778)€ (1.346) Diluted Loss Per Share (in EUR)€ (0.630)€ (0.496)€ (1.778)€ (1.346)CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (unaudited)(in thousands)As Of September 302025 December 31 2024 ASSETS Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 4 471 4 753 Intangible assets 50 108 50 381 Right of use assets 1 891 3 496 Deferred tax asset 25 76 Other long-term receivables 1 759 1 617 € 58 254 € 60 323 Current assets Inventory 6 075 4 716 Trade receivables 1 356 3 382 Contract assets 1 384 − Other receivables 3 026 2 774 Other current assets 1 026 1 656 Financial assets 11 609 51 369 Cash and cash equivalents 10 869 34 186 € 35 345 € 98 083 Total assets € 93 599 € 158 406 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Share capital and reserves Share capital 6 450 6 430 Share premium 314 417 314 345 Share based payment reserve 11 765 9 300 Other comprehensive income 1 111 914 Retained loss (282 789) (217 735) Total equity attributable to shareholders € 50 954 € 113 254 LIABILITIES Non-current liabilities Financial debt 18 787 18 725 Lease liability 1 382 2 562 Provisions 1 106 1 000 Deferred tax liability 30 19 Contract liability 581 472 Other liability − 845 € 21 886 € 23 623 Current liabilities Financial debt 248 248 Lease liability 742 1 118 Trade payables 9 559 9 505 Current tax liability 3 376 4 317 Contract liability 342 117 Other liability 6 492 6 224 € 20 759 € 21 529 Total liabilities € 42 645 € 45 152 Total equity and liabilities € 93 599 € 158 406RevenueRevenue was €2.0 million for the third quarter ending September 30  2025  compared to €1.3 million for the third quarter ending September 30  2024  representing a 56% year over year increase.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold was €0.8 million for the third quarter ending September 30  2025  representing a gross profit of €1.2 million  or gross margin of 60.5%.

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher R&D activities. Additionally  following FDA approval in August 2025  the amortization of the related intangible assets commenced leading to an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.Selling  General and AdministrativeFor the third quarter ending September 30  2025  selling  general and administrative expenses were €12.7 million  versus €8.0 million for the third quarter ending September 30  2024.

This was driven by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to support commercialization of the Genio system  including the Company’s overall scale-up preparations for the commercialization of the Genio system in the US in connection with the receipt of FDA approval  and increased R&D and manufacturing activities  in addition to higher depreciation and amortization expenses.Cash PositionAs of September 30  2025  cash  cash equivalents and financial assets totaled €22.5 million  compared to €43.0 million at the end of June 30  2025.Third Quarter 2025Nyxoah’s financial report for the third quarter of 2025  including details of the consolidated results  are available on the investor page of Nyxoah’s website (https://investors.nyxoah.com/financials).Conference call and webcast presentationCompany management will host a conference call to discuss financial results on Thursday  November 13  2025  beginning at 10:30pm CET / 4:30pm ET.A webcast of the call will be accessible via the Investor Relations page of the Nyxoah website or through this link: Nyxoah's Q3 2025 Earnings Call Webcast.

Revenue growth of 1.9% on a like-for-like basis.Acute hospitals admission volume growth in France and Sweden despite 1 less business day this quarter compared to the same period last year  reflecting sustained patient need for healthcare and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more quality care services in a competitive landscape.Unaudited group EBITDA for the quarter ending 30 September 2025 increased 7m€ or 6.5% to 112m€  despite the end of the French revenue guarantee curtailing subsidies income by 7m€. Cost inflation remains underfunded by governments and continues to outstrip revenue rates indexation. Recent decision on imaging tariffs in France shows that pressure on price of services fixed by public payors will remain a key challenge.This increase in EBITDA is mainly due to a strong performance in Sweden where all our activities  especially primary care  contributed to the growth.Operational performance sustained through continued cost saving efforts on administrative costs and agency staff  productivity improvements from staffing levels better matching activity volumes and optimizing procurement costs. The portfolio of facilities is continuously reviewed to adjust specialty offering within our geographical clusters to local constraints  needs and opportunities and to enhance the quality of healthcare services to the population they care for.Net financial debt as of 30 September 2025 amounted to €3 819m  including €1 867m of IAS17 (pre-IFRS16) net debt. Pre-IFRS16 unaudited net leverage amounts to 5.2x as of September 2025 vs. 5.3x as of September 2024.Mission-led strategy drives tangible profitable growth and medical excellenceThe implementation of new models of care continues in France  notably through the expansion of day hospitals in medicine  closely aligned with patients’ healthcare needs.Further progress was made to develop out of hospital and outpatient activities with the opening of 2 primary care centres in Norway based on a new public partnership model  2 new mental health outpatient settings in France (10 as of today)  and the set-up of a new imaging heavy equipment in France during the quarter. Concomitantly  the integration of the former Cosem primary care in France is progressing well as an enabler of our objective to coordinate care pathways where we operate.Activity and revenue:Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €1 207m for the quarter ending 30 September 2025  up 2.6% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the period was up with a 1.9% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 1.4% (1.9% on a like-for-like basis) on the back of increased volumes  despite one less business day this quarter compared to last year  and including the +0.5% indexation of MSO tariffs since March 2025. France hospital admissions in our hospitals rose vs. the same quarter last year  mainly through a +2.0% increase in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics) patient stays driven by a +3.5% increase in ambulatory care stays.Nordic countries revenue grew by +2.6% on a like-for-like and constant exchange rate bases  with a reported revenue growth of +5.4% benefitting from 9m€ (or 2.6%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations (appreciation of SEK vs EUR on average vs the same quarter last year). Solid organic growth in Sweden underpinned by primary care activity benefitting from a long-term increasing trend of listed patients as well as growing volumes in St Göran with a reducing length of stay. Softer activity in Denmark primary care units whilst the Danish hospitals revenue stabilised following the merger and consolidation of our facilities in Copenhagen.EBITDA:EBITDA increased 7m€ or 6.5% to 112m€ for the quarter ending 30 September 2025 vs. the prior corresponding period. The Group's EBITDA growth has been negatively impacted by the end of the French government's revenue guarantee from 1 January 2025  representing a 7m€ shortfall vs. the same quarter last year. Funding otherwise received through French tariff increases and various public payors in the Nordics still only partially covered inflation from medical staff salary and wages as well as overall procurement and outsourced services price increases  putting pressure on operating margins. Productivity efforts and cost control across all geographies already initiated last year have been reinforced and allowed the Group operations to offset cost inflation  growing EBITDA by 7m€ and improving EBITDA margin by 0.3 pts. The corresponding actions range from increasing staffing productivity  optimising medical purchases and consumption  to saving on administrative costs and carefully adjusting hiring structure (eg. agency staff)  while also pursuing revenue development initiatives such as in day medicine and imaging activities.Reported EBITDA of 112m€ for the quarter ending 30 September 2025 in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for 69m€ (vs. 66m€ last year) which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt. The increase in the lease accounting impact vs. prior year primarily came from the effect of rents indexation and the impact of a stronger SEK vs the EUR this quarter for c. 0 6m€.Cash flow & financing:Net cash flow from operating activities of -44m€ in this quarter reflects the lower seasonality of our medical  surgical and obstetrical activities over the summer months  and its 13m€ decrease versus -31m€ in the prior corresponding period primarily arises from the negative working capital variation linked to the repayment of French government cash advances over the summer. These were extended in April and May both in 2024 and 2025 to compensate the billing hold caused by the late publication of French DRG tariffs in each year. However  their repayment over the July to September period was higher in this years’ quarter  driving the decrease in working capital variation vs. last year’s comparable quarter.Reported net financial debt as of 30 September 2025 amounted to 3 819m€  of which 1 867m€ on a restated basis (i.e. restated from the IFRS16 impact on operating or non-financial rents). Restated net leverage amounts to 5.2x as of September 2025  vs. 5.3x as of September 2024. Focus remains on cash flow generation through operational efficiency and working capital improvement.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“At Ramsay Santé  our purpose - Improving health through constant innovation - is at the heart of everything we do  and we continue implementing the Company’s 'Yes We Care 2025' strategy of providing integrated care services to patients across all populations throughout the entire care pathways to deliver on our mission.

We have achieved an EBITDA growth of 6 5% and an EBITDA margin improvement of 0 3 pts with an organic revenue growth of 1 9 %. We will continue to transform Ramsay Santé as a partner of choice for patients  doctors  staff and other stakeholders whilst ensuring its sustainable and profitable growth.”The Board of Directors that met on 13 November 2025 approved this unaudited trading update for the quarter ended 30 September 2025.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.
