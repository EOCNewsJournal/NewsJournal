Sign up to receive weekly analysis of the latest developments in international relations  direct to your inbox.Nightly  for months now  Ukraine’s cities have been pounded by relentless aerial attacks. In addition to its grinding and attritional ground offensives in the east and south of the country  since early summer  the Russian military has greatly expanded its air offensive against centres of population  looking to collapse morale and undermine the Ukrainian people’s will to fight on.And as winter approaches  so those aerial bombardments have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure.Repeatedly in recent weeks  whole cities have been plunged into cold darkness as power plants  transmission lines and regional and local substations are damaged or destroyed. Rolling power outages are now common  reportedly lasting up to 14 hours in some cases.So the latest political scandal to hit the government of Volodymyr Zelensky could hardly have come at a worse time for his country. And to make matters worse  it revolves around Ukraine’s energy industry.Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies this week released the findings of Operation Midas  an 18-month probe into Energoatom  the state-owned operator of all of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants  investigating allegations of bribes and kickbacks said to amount to US$100 million (£76 million). Raids were carried out around the country and seven people have been arrested.What makes this so dangerous for Zelensky is that one of the people named in the probe is a former business partner of his. Businessman Timur Mindich was the co-owner  with Zelensky  of Kvartal 95 Studio – the platform on which the Ukrainian president made his name as a comedian before he entered politics (ironically  under the circumstances  as an anti-corruption candidate).Mindich is reported to have left the country  but he is said to have connections to several senior government ministers. The scandal risks tainting the already embattled Zelensky government by association.What’s worse  as Stefan Wolff and Tetyana Malyarenko explain  is that only a few months before this scandal exploded  Zelensky tried to bring Ukraine’s independent anti-corruption agencies under the direct control of his government. He backed down in the face of huge demonstrations  but this latest corruption scandal is likely to weaken him further.He has already lost his justice minister  German Galushchenko  and energy minister  Svitlana Hrynchuk. And  as Wolff and Malyarenko point out  the last thing Zelensky needs while his European allies debate how to raise desperately needed funds to keep fighting is a whiff of corruption surrounding his administration.Read more: Ukraine: energy corruption scandal threatens to derail Zelensky's government and undermine its war effortHaving spent the day debating how to raise the huge amounts of money Ukraine will need in 2026  it appears that the EU is closing in on a preferred option. The European Commission considered two main options. One plan is for either the EU to borrow €140 billion (£124 billion) using its long-term budget as collateral. Another is to use the frozen Russian assets as collateral for a loan to Ukraine  to be repaid after the war if Russia pays reparations to Kyiv.An idea floated by Norwegian economists to use Norway’s €1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund to guarantee the loan was quickly scotched by the country’s finance minister  former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg  who said that while Norway was happy to contribute  it could not be responsible for the entire amount.The next move will be to assuage the fears of Belgium  which is where the assets are held by securities depository Euroclear  that a successful legal challenge by Russia could leave it liable for repayment. The Kremlin has already made noises to this effect.Veronika Hinman  the deputy director of the University of Portsmouth’s military education team  believes that while the massive injection of funds will certainly enable Ukraine to continue to fight  it’s unlikely to be decisive. “It cannot deliver the manpower  weapons or morale ” she writes.Hinman describes the fairly dire situation on the battlefield  where Russia is slowly but surely beating back the defenders outside key cities such as Pokrovsk and Huliaipole. The invaders continue to press for a breakthrough in these strategically important towns  which would allow them to make a push into central Ukraine.Institute for the Study of WarRussia has been unsuccessfully trying to capture both Pokrovsk and Huliaipole for many months (its troops briefly entered Huliaipole on March 5 2022  only a couple of weeks after the invasion started  and were pushed back). But the fight appears to be increasingly lopsided  writes Hinman. Russia may have lost more than a million troops – killed or injured – but it has huge reserves and its retooled war economy appears to be bearing up reasonably well  despite US sanctions.So the need for more money from the EU grows ever more critical  Hinman writes. But she worries that “in the end  this latest wave of aid may buy Ukraine time – but it’s unlikely to deliver victory”.Read more: Kyiv's European allies debate ways of keeping the cash flowing to Ukraine but the picture on the battlefield is grimTrump: lawfare and diplomacyIn the US  meanwhile  blows were struck in a different kind of war as a Florida prosecutor issued subpoenas to a range of officials that the US president believes are part of the “deep-state” opposition to his presidency.When you look at the targets of these subpoenas  which include former CIA director John Brennan  former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok  former FBI attorney Lisa Page and former director of national intelligence James Clapper  the thinking becomes clear. All of them were involved in the federal investigation into alleged links between Russian intelligence and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.As we know  under instruction from Trump  the Justice Department has already gone after several of the president’s enemies  including former FBI director James Comey  former national security adviser John Bolton and New York attorney general Letitia James.It’s all part of what has become known as the “grand conspiracy”  writes Robert Dover  an expert in intelligence from the University of Hull. And it appears as if the Trump administration is gearing up for some serious lawfare.As Dover observes  whether or not these investigations actually end up with anyone facing court is  while not immaterial  not the whole point of the exercise. In the US  these investigations can take a huge toll on their targets: emotionally  financially and health-wise.Dover points to a new unit in the Department of Justice  the “weaponization working group”  whose director  Ed Martin  said his job was to expose and discredit people he believes to working against the president: “If they can be charged  we’ll charge them. But if they can’t be charged  we will name them.” This  writes Dover  is a complete inversion of the traditional approach of: “charge crimes  not people”.It feels like another step on the road to authoritarian government  he observes.Read more: First subpoenas issued as Donald Trump's 'grand conspiracy' theory begins to take shapeThe incumbent of the Oval Office  meanwhile  received the (relatively) new leader of Syria  Ahmed al-Sharaa  this week. He’s the first Syrian leader ever to visit the White House and the visit represents a considerable rise to power and respectability for someone who  until a year ago  was leading an insurgent group against Syria’s Assad regime. His Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was  until July  proscribed by the US as a terrorist organisation.But  as William Plowright  a Syria expert from Durham University  points out  as far back as 2015  former CIA director David Petraeus suggested that the US should consider working with the organisation which later became al-Sharaa’s group  Jabhat al-Nusra  against Islamic State.Associated Press / AlamyAs Plowright observes  there are upsides for both Trump and al-Sharaa in striking up a working relationship  not least of which is that it would deprive Iran of its closest ally in the region.Read more: How former jihadist Ahmed al-Sharaa ended up being welcomed to the White HouseSign up to receive our weekly World Affairs Briefing newsletter from The Conversation UK.

Today marks the next chapter in that legacy – one built around exchange. The brand's transformation redefines the hotel as a dynamic social stage  designed to reflect the fluid rhythm of today's traveler.A striking expression of the new brand language is the Pullman Portal. Inspired by the railway tunnels of Pullman's past  these sculptural entryways mark the transition into a distinct world of exchange. Each Portal acts as a bold architectural signature - recognizable globally  yet reinterpreted locally through materials  form  and color. Guests can already experience the Pullman Portal at Pullman Dubai Jumeirah Lake Towers  while upcoming openings including Pullman Perth Airport and Pullman Hamilton will introduce the design signature to new markets. Further installations will roll out across the network as renovation programs progress.Meeting and event spaces have also been re-imagined with flexibility at their core - places designed to transform with ease from keynote venue to creative studio  from workshop arena to cultural runway - celebrating the belief that exchange thrives in environments built for possibility.A New Culinary StageCulinary and mixology experiences sit at the heart of the Pullman experience. Bars take center stage as social anchors  alive from the first espresso to the final cocktail. This new era will see menus prioritize spontaneity  shareability  and global flavors  encouraging guests to stay  mingle  and discover.Launching in 2026  Unexpected Pairings is an experiential bar ritual that will invite guests to draw from a deck of playing cards to discover imaginative flavor combinations of food and cocktails. The experience playfully redefines the art of mixology and dining  encouraging playful curiosity and provoking conversation and exchange through contrast  discovery  and taste.Human-Centric Service for a New GenerationOver the past 18 months  Pullman has introduced a new learning program for its teams  focused on empathy  cultural awareness  and connection-building. The service culture is grounded in emotional intelligence  empowering Heartists to blend confidence  intuition  and genuine human warmth within every guest interaction.To date  around 60% of Pullman's 20 000+ Heartists have completed the training  with the remainder set to follow in 2026  equipping teams to respond to guests not only efficiently  but with greater insight and sincere care.Pullman xChange: Where Vision Meets LegacyHeld from 13 to 14 November 2025  the inaugural Pullman xChange transformed Pullman Dubai Downtown into a live forum for creative collision. Developed with the House of Beautiful Business – a global think tank and community connecting business  technology  and the arts – the experience explored ideas  innovations  and cultural shifts under the theme Build What Outlasts You.The event forms part of a three-year collaboration between Pullman and the House of Beautiful Business  bringing together a hospitality leader and a global community of creatives and thinkers. Together  the partnership will cultivate a new era of purposeful gatherings  thought leadership  and exchange across continents.The program in Dubai featured immersive workshops  artistic performances  and discussions led by pioneering voices including Abdulaziz AlJaziri Deputy CEO & COO of the Dubai Future Foundation; neuroscientist Hannah Critchlow; cyberpsychologist Elaine Kasket; and architect Adib Dada.Rooted in the belief that progress begins when we challenge what we know and see the familiar with fresh perspective  Pullman xChange blends dialogue  artistic expression  and sensory experience. In 2026  Pullman xChange will come to life in Europe  Asia  and South America  each edition co-created with a cultural collective to reflect local context.Momentum for GrowthPullman's transformation marks a bold step into the future — one that fuses our heritage of movement and modernity with a renewed sense of purpose. Each hotel is conceived as a place of exchange  where ideas and people move freely  fostering creativity and connection. Launching this transformation alongside Pullman xChange felt instinctive  as the event truly brings our brand philosophy to life. It embodies our new spirit — dynamic  connected  and alive with possibility. And this is only the beginning of a movement that will continue to unfold across our hotels worldwide.

The Convertible Bonds may thus give rise to the creation of a maximum of 1 886 790 new ordinary shares with a par value of €0.10 each (the ""New Shares"")  potentially representing approximately 3.52% of its share capital on a non-diluted basis.Patrick ALEXANDRE  CEO of the Company  said: ""We are delighted to be able to issue these convertible bonds without a discount on our current share price and we thank Vatel Capital SA for their support. This bridge financing allows us to remain flexible while BARDA continues to review our EUA application for ZEPIZURE® with a view to filing it as soon as possible.""Reasons for the issue and use of proceedsAs announced in June and September 2025  CROSSJECT has continued its regulatory activities in collaboration with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to obtain regulatory approvals for ZEPIZURE® in the United States  including the filing of an Emergency Use Authorization application with the FDA.Since this summer  CROSSJECT has been submitting data to be included in the dossier to BARDA  who has also organized audits of production facilities  notably in Dijon and Gray  an important preparatory step for a possible inspection by the FDA. CROSSJECT continues to expect BARDA to submit the dossier in 2025  followed by rapid emergency use authorization (EUA) approval by the FDA.In addition  in September 2025  CROSSJECT secured an increase in R&D funding from BARDA for a total amount of €11.3 million. This significant  non-dilutive funding provides increased financial security throughout the future stages of development and will contribute  in particular  to the working capital required for the manufacturing stages.In parallel  CROSSJECT has also made progress in its clinical development plan with a view to a future second New Drug Application (NDA) for ZEPIZURE® for the treatment of status epilepticus in adults and in children. Developments relating to ZENEO® Adrenaline and ZENEO® Hydrocortisone are progressing in line with the resources devoted to the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) process.The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the transaction as follows:Approximately 50% will be allocated to the development and registration of ZEPIZURE®  including the coverage of related operating costs in addition to the R&D costs reimbursed by its US sponsor;Approximately 50% will be allocated to all other research and development activities  investments in manufacturing facilities  and the Company's general corporate needs  including the repayment of certain financial creditors.With the net proceeds from this transaction amounting to approximately €4.9 million  the Company estimates that its net working capital requirements will be sufficient to meet its obligations until it achieves its regulatory objectives for the EUA for ZEPIZURE®. The Company continues to explore dilutive and non-dilutive additional financing to extend its cash runway until it receives the first payments from its US sponsor. The Company could also receive additional funds from the exercise of its stock warrants  issued in November 2024 with an exercise price of €2.25  to meet additional financing needs  for an amount that could reach approximately €10.2 million. As of the date of this press release  only 200 stock warrants have been exercised.Main characteristics of the transactionThe Convertible Bonds were issued with the removal of preferential subscription rights in favor of Investors belonging to a category of persons1   by decision of the Management Board dated November 14  2025  in accordance with the authorization granted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on October 9  2025 within the framework of the delegation granted by the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting held on January 31  2025  under the terms of its 4th resolution.Description of the Convertible BondsThe table below provides a description of the terms and conditions of each tranche of Convertible Bonds:TrancheNumber of Convertible Bonds Nominal value per Convertible Bond Total amount of each Tranche(in euros)MaturityAnnual interest rate Tranche 1 2 000 000 €1 €2 000 000 3 years 7.5% Tranche 2 €2 000 000 €1 €2 000 000 4 years 8.5% Tranche 3 1 000 000 €1 €1 000 000 5 years 9.5%The Bonds are convertible at any time and are transferable.

First  The Company received a message from a shareholder who reported owning more than 5% of the shares. In a separate transaction  a long-standing and supportive shareholder of Tonner Drones reinforced their support for the company by providing a regular bond and indicated they potentially intend to increase their position to potentially 5% as well. Finally  Tonner Drones announces that it has embarked on a path of renewed activity and growth by demonstrating its commitment with an investment in MyHotelMatch ('MHM')  currently an empty shell  to lead the company towards a successful future and turnaround.These actions underscore Tonner Drones' ongoing commitment to value-creation and strategic growth for shareholders. Following a thorough restructuring and refinancing  Tonner Drones further demonstrates that it is now building a new future and wants to embark on a path of growth with renewed activity. Tonner Drones saw opportunities to acquire  at attractive valuation  receivables in the company MHM. Tonner Drones will help MHM to restructure its debt and develop new business within the company.Having successfully completed its own business turnaround  Tonner Drones sees considerable potential for MHM. Possible strategic directions under consideration include strengthening MHM’s core real estate business  exploring opportunities in the rapidly growing drone sector  and assessing the feasibility of establishing a cryptocurrency company.Following a series of productive discussions with MHM’s management  Tonner Drones could play an active role in shaping MHM’s future. The company will make proposals for the formation of a new board of directors. MHM already agreed to appoint a new CEO during the upcoming Shareholders Meeting. Tonner Drones CEO  van den Ouden  is likely to become temporary CEO during the transition phase until the shareholders' meeting. This collaboration is expected to accelerate the development of a renewed strategic vision for MHM  leveraging Tonner Drones’ expertise in business transformation.CEO van den Ouden is since August in the possesion of ORA and receivables against MHM. For transparency reasons and to avoid conflicts of interest  Tonner Drones and van den Ouden have the intention to transfer these assets to Tonner Drones at cost price (€500k was paid for €1 5M worth of receivables and ORA). In total  Tonner Drones will then own €2.75M of the debt and ORA in MHM  with a cost price of €1M.Separate Shareholder Transaction Reinforces Support for Tonner DronesIn a separate development  Tonner Drones has entered into an agreement with a historic and supportive shareholder for a transaction representing a potential stake over 5% of the company’s share capital. Importantly  this transaction is independent of the MHM investment  and the shareholder is or was not involved with MHM in any capacity.During the recent capital increase (that was open for all shareholders)  the investor expressed interest in acquiring a 5 % equity position in Tonner Drones. The board of directors recently came into talks with the investor and is pleased to announce the following transaction  because it values a strong shareholder base of engaged investors.The investor is currently a shareholder in Tonnes Drones  owning close to 3 million shares and over 5 million different listed BSA and has indicated his intention to purchase more shares on the stock exchange to reach a position of around 10M shares. In addition  he is investing €560 000 in a regular bond with a 2% interest rate and maturity date until 31-12-2026. The investor will receive 40 million BSA with a strike price of €0.028. All BSA hold an 1 on 1 parity. Given the investor's long-term vision  he has accepted a 6-month lockup for shares resulting from conversions from the closing date of this contract. The shareholder can reach a position of more than 7 5% of the shares  with proceeds for the Company of €1.120.000. Tonner will use 50% of any BSA exercise to repay the bond loan. The dilution for current shareholders would then be around 6 7%.In addition to this transaction  Tonner Drones is pleased to welcome another shareholder who announced that he recently has acquired more than 5% of the shares on the stock exchange. With CEO Van den Ouden holding over 12% of the shares  Tonner Drones is assured of a strong shareholder base that supports its policy.""I am pleased that we can finally embark on the path to renewed growth  since we've completed the refinancing and restructuring of Tonner Drones. And it is great that we feel the shareholders' support for our strategy."" said CEO Diede van den Ouden. ""We're in an interesting phase with strong momentum in the drone  defense  and crypto sectors. That's why I believe we've found an interesting opportunity with MHM to create value for our shareholders.""Tonner Drones also reports that conversions in TDBS (FR001400RIB4) have been reopened after being frozen during the right issue process. The BSA  that was issued to all shareholders in August 2024  has undergone a ratio adjustment due to the dilution that has occurred. For every 3 TDBS  2.08 shares are now obtained. Based on the minimum conversion number  this equates to 135 000 TDBS and 93 600 shares. The strike remains €0 0125.End of Press-Release.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones develops technologies for the logistics sector.

The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on November 12th 2025  approved the Group's third quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Statements.Third Quarter 2025 ResultsQ3 Group EBITDA of €210 million; EBITDA margin strong at 23%Tubes EBITDA per tonne increased by more than 25% sequentially to €621Robust US customer demand demonstrated in recent bookingsExpanding market share in Brazil via new Long-Term Agreement with PetrobrasQ4 2025 Group EBITDA expected to range between €195 million and €225 millionConfirm expected improvement in EBITDA in H2 2025 vs. H1 2025HIGHLIGHTS & OUTLOOKThird Quarter 2025 ResultsGroup EBITDA of €210 million  up 12% sequentially  in line with midpoint of guidanceGroup EBITDA margin was strong at 23%  the highest level since Q1 2024 Tubes EBITDA margin improved more than 320 bps sequentially to 22%  with Tubes EBITDA increasing 30% sequentially to €188 million due to higher selling prices and slightly higher volumes. Mine & Forest EBITDA decreased by (22%) sequentially to €35 million due to lower volumes and higher costs  though EBITDA margin remained solid at 42%.Adjusted free cash flow of €69 million; total cash generation of €67 million; net debt reduced to €140 millionFinalized sale of Serimax to further streamline invested capital and focus on core business activitiesRedeemed 10% of outstanding 2032 senior notesFourth Quarter 2025 Group EBITDA is expected to range between €195 million and €225 million:In Tubes  EBITDA per tonne is expected to be similar to the Q3 2025 level  while volumes are expected to be slightly above the Q3 2025 level.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 1.4 million tonnes.Full Year 2025 OutlookConfirm Group EBITDA improvement in H2 2025 vs. H1 2025Full Year Group EBITDA is expected to range between €799 and €829 millionPhilippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“Vallourec delivered solid results once again in the third quarter  with Group EBITDA margin rising to its highest level since the first quarter of 2024. This quarter marks three straight years in which Vallourec has delivered a Group EBITDA margin around 20% and positive total cash generation – a clear testament to the major structural changes we have made within our business since May 2022.“Our advantaged manufacturing footprint and reputation for high-quality tubular solutions is paying dividends in the United States. Our order intake in this market in recent months has been robust and reflects stable customer drilling activity and an improvement in our market share. We continue to expect a slowdown in imports  which currently represent about 40% of supply in the US OCTG market  as the market responds to higher steel tariffs.“Also in the quarter  we secured a major contract in Brazil. Our new Long-Term Agreement with Petrobras will expand our market share and further demonstrate Vallourec’s ability to deliver high value-added solutions from our domestic manufacturing base. This contract carries potential revenue of up to $1 billion over four years.“Meanwhile  in select markets in the Eastern Hemisphere  we have seen delays in customer activity that will result in some orders being invoiced in 2026 – later than initially planned. That said  our key international customers continue to advance ambitious plans to grow their oil and gas production capacity over the coming years  which will drive solid demand for our solutions.“Since we announced the New Vallourec plan in May 2022  we have made significant progress towards our two primary strategic goals. We achieved our objective of crisis-proofing our business ahead of plan  and today we can point to significant progress in achieving best-in-class profitability. In the third quarter  we fully closed the gap in Tubes EBITDA per tonne versus our primary peer. This is thanks to our core principle of Value over Volume and the relentless focus of our teams on operational excellence.“Our journey does not end here. We remain focused on improving return on invested capital and returning capital to our shareholders. To this end  today we convened a special meeting for holders of Vallourec warrants  in which we will propose a modification in our warrant terms and conditions in order to allow the delivery not only of newly-issued shares but also of existing shares upon their exercise  at the Company’s option. This will allow maximum flexibility in our shareholder return framework in the coming year.”The consolidated financial statements are included in the pdf version of the press release.INFORMATION AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

Formal entry to the SKAO awaits parliamentary ratification of the intergovernmental agreement following the French government signing accession agreement with the Observatory in April 2022. The CNRS  which leads the SKA-France coordination  signed a collaboration agreement with SKAO in March 2022 which facilitates interaction with the French science community.The SKAO is currently building the two largest radio telescope arrays in the world  which will pose an enormous data challenge.For the SKAO  the SDP is a critical element of the Observatory’s scientific mission. When the telescopes begin early operations in the next few years  the SDP will process vast volumes of data  enabling researchers to decode cosmic signals and push the boundaries of astrophysics. The telescopes will need to process data equivalent to more than one million 4K Netflix streams  reducing it ""on the fly"" down to only a few thousand streams’ worth  and ultimately archiving ~700 PB a year.Initial deployments of SDP hardware are expected in Australia and South Africa during 2026.Through this partnership  the SKAO will be able to scale up its processing infrastructure as the telescopes grow  by relying on Eviden’s scalable approach: a catalogue of predefined scalable units (SUs) that can be deployed on demand at each site.Within this  Eviden offers a combination of Intel powered high-performance computing and software capabilities with Data Direct Networks (DDN) storage systems  ensuring low-latency and high-efficiency data handling  with local services delivered by its partner Evernex to ensure operational readiness and regional support. Eviden will also provide the system-level software that ensures all the hardware components work together as a single system.Nick Rees  SKAO head of Computing and Software said: “The hardware required by the SKAO must meet complex requirements. This includes designing a system that can be deployed in units as needed over time  ensuring that advances in computing and our understanding of the complexities can be incorporated into the SDP hardware during the multi-year construction period. We're dealing with an extremely big data challenge and Eviden is bringing a mature  tried and tested solution to the table. We're very pleased to have them join our delivery journey.”Emmanuel Le Roux  Group SVP  global head of Advanced Computing and AI  Eviden at Atos Group commented: “This project places Eviden’s technology at the core of one of the world’s most significant scientific endeavours of the decade  made possible through international cooperation: to build the two largest radio telescope arrays in the world  located in South Africa and Australia. As we start to deliver the first technologies through this contract  it reflects our commitment to supporting frontier science with co-designed  robust  scalable and energy-efficient computing solutions. We are proud to contribute to SKAO’s vision with a solution designed and delivered from Europe  and deployed across two continents to help unlock new discoveries about our universe.”As the SKAO moves towards delivering science  the partnership with Eviden marks a critical milestone in building the digital foundation for this groundbreaking radio astronomy endeavour. Together  the SKAO and Eviden are enabling a future where data becomes discovery  and where the mysteries of the cosmos come into sharper focus.Jean-Luc Moullet  Chief Research and Innovation Officer at French Ministry of Higher Education  Research and Space  highlighted: “The ministry is very proud of the contribution of France to SKAO  a world-leading infrastructure in radio-astronomy built with a strong partnership of countries and with great discoveries to come. It is a great satisfaction to see the alliance between astronomers and the French company Eviden  a leader in high-performance computing. This project comes with fantastic innovation prospects in this field to perform high-performance computing on very large volumes of data with the goal to minimize the environmental impact. This shows how very ambitious fundamental research can push technology to its limits and benefit to society.”Antoine Petit  President and CEO of CNRS said: “The CNRS and the SKA-France partners are proud of the strong engagement of French industry in tackling one of the most remarkable technological challenges of the SKA project: producing analysis-ready data from the immense data streams generated by the two telescopes. This contribution  which builds on advanced high-performance computing capabilities in the host countries  particularly in France with the CNRS- supercalculator Jean Zay  will play a key role in enabling the redistribution of hundreds of petabytes of data each year to the scientific community worldwide. It also reflects France commitment to the design of SKAO’s future computing infrastructure with a clear focus on environmental sustainability.”***About EvidenEviden is the Atos Group brand for hardware and software products with c. € 1 billion in revenue  operating in 36 countries and comprising four business units: advanced computing  cybersecurity products  mission-critical systems and vision AI.

53733,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/14/3188166/0/en/Press-Release-Sanofi-s-Teizeild-recommended-for-EU-approval-by-the-CHMP-for-patients-with-stage-2-type-1-diabetes.html,Press Release: Sanofi’s Teizeild recommended for EU approval by the CHMP for patients with stage 2 type 1 diabetes,Sanofi’s Teizeild recommended for EU approval by the CHMP for patients with stage 2 type 1 diabetes  Recommendation based on the TN-10 study ...,Sanofi’s Teizeild recommended for EU approval by the CHMP for patients with stage 2 type 1 diabetesRecommendation based on the TN-10 study  demonstrating Teizeild’s ability to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D)  compared to placebo  in adults and children with stage 2 T1DIf approved  Teizeild would become the first disease-modifying T1D therapy in the EUParis  November 14  2025. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Teizeild (teplizumab) to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients eight years of age and older with stage 2 T1D.The positive opinion is supported by positive data from the TN-10 phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT01030861)  which demonstrated that Teizeild significantly delayed the onset of stage 3 T1D by a median of approximately two years compared to placebo. At the end of the study  the proportion of patients who remained in stage 2 T1D was twice as high in the Teizeild group as in the placebo group (57% vs 28%). The safety profile was consistent with previous studies of Teizeild  with the most frequently observed adverse events being blood or bone marrow-related (transient lymphopenia) and dermatologic or skin-related (rash).“We are encouraged by the positive opinion in stage 2 T1D  which represents an important step toward transforming the 100-year-old treatment paradigm for autoimmune T1D ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines at Sanofi. “By targeting the disease at an early stage  Teizeild can help prevent the natural progression of T1D  extending the time patients can stay independent of insulin.”Teizeild (known as Tzield outside the EU) is a CD3 directed monoclonal antibody. It is approved in the US  the UK  China  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and children aged eight years and older with stage 2 T1D. Following the positive CHMP recommendation and based on conversations with the EMA  at this time Sanofi will not progress its application for recently diagnosed stage 3 T1D and is evaluating next steps. Additional regulatory reviews are ongoing in other jurisdictions around the world.About autoimmune T1DT1D is a progressive autoimmune condition where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin producing beta cells by one’s own immune system. There are four stages to the progression of T1D:In stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range (normoglycemia). At this stage  T1D is presymptomatic.In stage 2 (also presymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells / beta cell function.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will start to experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision  and generalized fatigue. Management of stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.Stage 4 is defined as long-standing autoimmune T1D  often accompanied by evidence of chronic diabetic complications  where little to no beta-cell function remains (it’s been estimated that beta-cell mass is reduced by up to 95%). At this point  the T1D-related autoantibodies might not be present anymore in the blood  as most beta-cells have been rendered useless by the autoimmune attack.About TN-10TN-10 was a pivotal phase 2  randomized  placebo-controlled  double-blind study. The study evaluated Teizeild for the prevention or delay of stage 3 T1D in people diagnosed with stage 2 T1D (presence of at least two T1D-related autoantibodies and dysglycemia) who were relatives of people living with autoimmune T1D. Seventy-six participants aged eight to 45 were enrolled (Teizeild n=44  placebo n=32). They were randomized to receive a single 14-day course of either Teizeild or placebo.The primary endpoint was the elapsed time from randomization to the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune stage 3 T1D (progression from stage 2 T1D to stage 3 T1D). Key secondary end points included safety and tolerability.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people's lives and delivering compelling growth.

Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel  Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos.Tsipras–Vaxevanis seriesToday there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga  as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday  especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well  I was told that the relationship soured later  when Tsipras was in the opposition  and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break  especially in politics  and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves  not to the… audience  particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras  with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy  should have expected such clashes  bitterness  and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out  there will be much more  possibly much worse. In that sense  I don’t know whether he did the right thing  because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots ” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore  some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him  hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand  the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad  it’s still publicity  and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most.Nikos and his stars…Meanwhile  Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios  named Stavros Michailidis  appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones  and with a 19-seat capacity  at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft  he replied: “I know  I know  because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP  whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related)  read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand  Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement  yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that?At the Members’ LoungeI hear that today at noon  after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time ” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp  things have always been worked out around a table  but K. M. avoids dinners.Kimberly’s gift to the ArchbishopThe in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm  and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle  who gives especially elegant gifts  brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging  while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica  but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas  about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador.Dendias–USAAfter meeting the Archbishop  the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense  where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast  toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems.Zelensky’s advance teamThe government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency  Maximos Mansion  and Parliament  where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total  from the Press Office  Protocol  and the Ukrainian Embassy  who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time  which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens  then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours  compared with the initial schedule.The ERT bill (the first in 12 years)Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT  the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words  our money—because  shockingly  the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone  including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years  following the bill on the registry of print and online media  order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting  and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things…NikolopoulosA longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who  through Nikos Karachalios  “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had  among other things  an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more?Euronext expects to acquire 54% to 56% of Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX)On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This  of course  remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon  as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side  where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares  brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients  and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors  it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast  where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders  but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success.Will the Euronext–ATHEX “marriage” pave the way for a faster upgrade of the Athens market?If the column had to place a bet  it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g.  a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously  a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know)  and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI  FTSE  etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed  with the relevant decision coming in two or three months  as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market  and beyond that  our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.”OTE’s deal with GEK TERNA – Grid Telecom and the dividendOTE’s CEO  Kostas Nebis  described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber  which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project  with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project  with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT)  of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure  and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023  OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones  and with the completion of the above agreements  OTE will assume the entire project  with the concession period (service period)  before the infrastructure is transferred to the State  amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts  Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas  as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country  in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market.Financial resultsAs for OTE’s results  what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously  something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications  but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market  but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax ” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally  pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case  OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange  with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end.BlackRock  Australian funds  and GEK TERNAAnd since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company  let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically  everything started in early autumn  when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center  where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules  photography was forbidden  the meetings were confidential  and the event was not widely publicized. At that time  representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia  made the necessary presentations  and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent  and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion  but even more important is the increase in trading volume  while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern.Greece on Washington’s radar – Wright’s “signals”Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference  U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight  this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital  his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles  it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region  Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side  particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI  we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation ” he said  implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes  his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives  at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects.Speedboats and Island ConnectivityThe cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close  marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones  facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels  which  however  do not fully cover the needs of islanders  particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time  freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels  which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route  which had been discussed at times  seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link  there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example  when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season.August Memories in the Stock MarketThe trading week began with the General Index at 1 986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week  closing at 2 074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer  when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2 000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets  which were drifting in negative territory  with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight  the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2 074.96 points  while today it traded between 2 057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2 083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million  with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session  followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23)  Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2)  Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2)  TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35)  and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC  Alpha Bank  Optima Bank  and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks  ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit  as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35).Theon and the Contract with the GermansThe Greek company Theon  listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange  is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100 000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move  Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400 000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026  Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi.New Blood in the Stock Market from TREK DevelopmentWith five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register  TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday  the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos  who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing  as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy  Energy Efficiency  and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million  zero debt  and first-half profits of €560 000  TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange  with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs.Turkey’s Aselsan Becomes a Key Player in European Air DefenseThe Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025  after the €1.65-billion agreement in September  while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome  a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI  which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions  Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider.The Next “Subprime Loan” Crisis Will Come From AutomobilesSeventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today  subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October  the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings  the largest subprime auto lender  acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns  then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway.,neutral,0.08,0.85,0.07,mixed,0.23,0.15,0.61,True,English,"['Athens Stock Exchange', 'K.M.', 'free dove', 'green eagle', 'conference', 'ambassador', 'Tsipras', 'consequences', 'Chios', 'August', 'small 19-seat commercial airplane', 'U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle', 'Grande Bretagne” hotel', 'SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos', 'The Intelligence Age', 'free dove” strategy', 'turbulent political period', 'large silver coin', 'San Francisco area', 'innovative weapons systems', 'Tsipras–Vaxevanis series', 'Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga', '19-seat capacity', 'Proto Thema', 'Prime Minister', 'distinguished Greek', 'foreign entrepreneurs', 'public figures', 'particular interest', 'open discussion', 'beloved actor', 'Giannis Bezos', 'publishing house', 'full truth', 'two sides', 'right thing', 'entire party', 'inner feelings', 'big shots', 'other hand', 'firefighting planes', 'data-recording aircraft', 'regular aircraft', 'Air Force', 'Rear Admiral', 'Coast Guard', 'new aircraft', 'less fuel', 'Mr. Michailidis', 'simple announcement', 'party leader', 'Members’ Lounge', 'K.
