I can tell you that the issue of confiscating Russian assets is causing serious concern for many. Our Chinese and Arab partners have openly expressed this: they are closely monitoring the situation. Until now  we've made every effort to maintain their trust — and they appreciate it "" Euroclear CEO Valerie Urban told a French newspaper.Urban added that if this trust begins to erode  the consequences could quickly hit Europe itself.The European Commission is obsessively trying to gain EU countries' approval for using Russia's sovereign assets for Ukraine — the amount in question is around €140 billion  intended as a special ""reparations loan"" that Ukraine is supposed to repay after the conflict  if ""Russia compensates it for material damage."" Belgium opposes this  fearing legal consequences.Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated on November 12 that Belgium understands the criminal nature of imposing the idea of a ""reparations loan"" to Ukraine using Russian assets and knows it will face retaliatory actions from Moscow.Following Russia's special operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze nearly half of Russia's foreign reserves  around €300 billion. Over €200 billion are held in the EU  mostly in the accounts of Belgium's Euroclear  one of the largest clearing systems in the world.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251109/theres-no-legal-way-to-seize-frozen-russian-assets--lavrov-1123080541.htmlrussiaukrainebelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleuroclear  valerie urban  european commission  russian assets  eu investment impact  belgium opposition  russian central bank assets  asset seizure  reparations loan  global investment  european union  arab investors  chinese investors  asset freeze  euroclear ceo  eu financing  g7 sanctions  legal consequences  russian foreign ministry  maria zakharova  belgium legal concerns",neutral,0.0,0.63,0.37,mixed,0.14,0.3,0.56,True,English,"['Global Investment Impact', 'Euroclear CEO', 'EU Plans', 'Russian Assets', 'russian central bank european commission assets', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urban', 'The European Commission', 'largest clearing systems', 'Global Investment Impact', 'belgium european union', ""EU countries' approval"", 'belgium legal concerns', 'special ""reparations loan', 'Russian Assets', 'economy russia ukraine', 'foreign reserves', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'special operation', 'G7 countries', 'Sputnik International', 'many clients', 'government representatives', 'French newspaper', 'material damage', 'legal consequences', 'Maria Zakharova', 'criminal nature', 'retaliatory actions', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'asset seizure', 'asset freeze', 'g7 sanctions', 'belgium opposition', 'eu financing', 'Chinese investors', 'Arab partners', 'arab investors', 'serious concern', 'EU Plans', 'ukraine belgium', 'sputnikglobe', 'warns', 'russian-assets', 'threats', 'investments', 'cdn1.', 'issue', 'situation', 'effort', 'trust', 'amount', 'question', 'conflict', 'November', 'idea', 'Moscow', 'half', 'accounts', 'world', 'lavrov', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-11-15,2025-11-16,sputnikglobe.com
