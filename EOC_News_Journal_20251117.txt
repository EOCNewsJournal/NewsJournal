Depending on the legal framework  we will decide what we can and want to do ” she added.Legal action is “not out of the question ” Urbain said when asked to elaborate.“The most important thing for Euroclear is credibility and trust… We are a crucial link that must remain infallible for the stability of financial markets.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been pushing to use frozen Russian assets to back a €140 billion ($160 billion) loan to Ukraine  an initiative that Belgium has opposed  insisting on guarantees that the legal and financial risks will be shared across the EU.The bloc’s decision to reclassify interest gained from the immobilized funds as “windfall profits” not belonging to Moscow – and to use them to fund Kiev – has already stretched legal definitions.However  Ukraine’s Western backers can no longer afford to keep funding it without seizing Russia’s sovereign funds  according to recent publications in the Economist and Financial Times.Kiev has also struggled to secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund  which has been further complicated by the massive corruption scandal recently uncovered in Ukraine.According to the country’s KSE institute  Kiev’s collapsing budget faces a $53 billion a year shortfall – one that Western sponsors are expected to cover.Moscow has long stated that it will view any attempts to confiscate its Central Bank assets as a “theft” that would fundamentally undermine third countries’ trust in Western financial institutions.,neutral,0.01,0.85,0.14,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Euroclear', 'seizure', 'CEO', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'International Monetary Fund', 'massive corruption scandal', 'global financial institutions', 'third countries’ trust', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Western financial institutions', 'Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear', 'CEO Valerie Urbain', '$50 billion budget deficit', 'collapsing budget', 'financial markets', 'financial risks', 'Financial Times', 'Western backers', 'Western sponsors', 'Le Monde', 'important thing', 'crucial link', 'European Commission', 'windfall profits', 'recent publications', 'KSE institute', 'legal framework', 'Legal action', 'legal definitions', 'new loan', 'Ukraine conflict', '€140 billion', 'bloc', 'finance', 'interview', 'Saturday', 'depository', 'securities', 'given', 'year', 'escalation', 'Anything', 'confiscation', 'hand', 'matter', 'laws', 'question', 'credibility', 'stability', 'initiative', 'Belgium', 'guarantees', 'decision', 'interest', 'Moscow', 'Kiev', 'Economist', 'country', 'shortfall', 'attempts', 'theft']",2025-11-16,2025-11-17,rt.com

Paris wants the G7 nations to provide financial guarantees for the unprecedented move  according to Barrot.The EU Commission is seeking to issue a €140 billion ($160 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium. Under the scheme  Ukraine would only pay it back if it receives reparations from Russia once the conflict is over – an outcome widely viewed as unlikely.The plan has faced opposition from Belgium  which holds the bulk of Russian assets at the Euroclear clearing house. The nation has demanded all EU members share the financial and legal risks of the move.According to Barrot  France has a set of demands linked to the proposed loan as well. Russian assets used as a collateral for the loan should not be “confiscated” to avoid legal issues  the minister said. G7 nations should provide guarantees for the loan alongside the EU nations “so that they carry the financial risk associated with this loan together with us ” he maintained  adding that “we do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.”Paris also demanded the loan be spent “on the military” in a way that “allows us to develop our… defense industry.”The EU has already sought to secure guarantees for the loan from various nations. Last week  Norway refused to use its €1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a financial backstop for the scheme.Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also said earlier this month that his nation would not support the plan. EU leaders failed to reach an agreement on the confiscation during a summit in October  effectively postponing a final decision until a European Council meeting in December.Russia has warned that seizing its frozen assets and using them to finance Ukraine would amount to theft  and that there is “no legal way” for Brussels to do so.,neutral,0.01,0.86,0.13,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['No certainty', 'Russian assets', 'French FM', 'Kiev', 'loan', 'French Foreign Minister Jean Noel Barrot', 'Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico', '€1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'European Council meeting', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'The EU Commission', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU “reparation loan', 'frozen assets', 'EU members', 'EU nations', 'EU leaders', 'G7 nations', 'legal issues', 'absolute certainty', 'defense industry', 'various nations', 'final decision', 'financial risk', 'financial backstop', 'EU loan', 'unprecedented move', 'legal risks', 'legal way', 'financial guarantees', 'Paris', 'Kiev', 'journalists', 'Sunday', '€140 billion', 'Belgium', 'scheme', 'Ukraine', 'reparations', 'conflict', 'outcome', 'plan', 'opposition', 'bulk', 'France', 'demands', 'collateral', 'military', 'Norway', 'agreement', 'confiscation', 'summit', 'October', 'December', 'theft', 'Brussels']",2025-11-16,2025-11-17,rt.com

On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around 140 billion euros ($161 billion) in Russian money could be used as a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine will only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage from Moscow."" Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences. There is still no consensus among EU nations on what to do with Russian state assets  Haddad said. France insists any scenario must comply with international law. At the October 23 summit  EU leaders failed to agree on the Commission's proposal to use frozen Russian Central Bank assets as the basis for a Ukraine loan. The issue will be revisited at the European Council meeting from December 18-19. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling about 300 billion euros. Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly at the Belgian-based clearing house Euroclear. The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the move as a theft. On November 12  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the Commission's proposal to issue a ""reparations loan"" to Ukraine backed by immobilized Russian assets was illegal and warned that Moscow would retaliate.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251115/euroclear-ceo-warns-of-global-investment-impact-amid-eu-plans-to-seize-russian-assets-1123119339.htmlrussiaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalfrozen russian assets  eu debate  benjamin haddad  european defense industry  eu rearmament  russian central bank reserves  reparations loan ukraine  eu legal concerns  belgium opposition  euroclear russian funds  eu summit deadlock  eu ukraine financing plan  moscow response  zakharova warning  g7 asset freeze  eu international law dispute",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.35,0.65,True,English,"['Frozen Reserves', 'EU', 'Plan', 'Russia', 'Defense', 'Ukraine', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'frozen Russian Central Bank assets', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'Belgian news agency Belga', 'russian central bank reserves', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'foreign currency reserves', 'French Minister Delegate', 'Belgian-based clearing house', 'European Council meeting', 'europe european union', 'euroclear russian funds', 'g7 asset freeze', 'The European Commission', 'European defense industry', 'international law dispute', 'Russian assets', 'reparations loan ukraine', 'ukraine financing plan', 'Frozen Reserves', 'zakharova warning', 'Russian money', 'European Affairs', 'European accounts', 'Sputnik International', 'war effort', '140 billion euros', 'material damage', 'legal consequences', 'October 23 summit', 'military operation', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'legal concerns', 'Ukraine loan', 'EU countries', 'Benjamin Haddad', 'EU nations', 'EU leaders', 'belgium opposition', 'moscow response', 'sputnikglobe', 'deepens', 'decision', 'rearmament', 'economy', 'cdn1.', 'November', 'compensation', 'fears', 'consensus', 'France', 'scenario', 'proposal', 'basis', 'issue', 'December', 'start', 'half', 'move', 'theft', 'ceo', 'warns', 'plans', 'russian-assets', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'deadlock']",2025-11-16,2025-11-17,sputnikglobe.com
53739,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/by-delaying-decision-on-using-russias-frozen-assets-for-ukraine-europe-is-quietly-hedging-its-bets-269507,By delaying a decision on using Russia’s frozen assets for Ukraine  Europe is quietly hedging its bets,The EU is not abandoning Ukraine  but it is recalibrating its risk exposure. There is growing doubt that Ukraine can win – even if EU leaders won’t say so aloud.,As Russia continues its grinding offensive and Ukraine braces for another winter of war  the European Union remains paralysed over a seemingly straightforward decision: whether to use 140 billion euros (A$250 billion) in frozen Russian assets to support Kyiv.Officially  the delay is about legal caution and financial liability.But beneath the surface  a more uncomfortable truth is emerging: some EU leaders may no longer believe Ukraine can win.This isn’t about public rhetoric. Most European heads of state still affirm their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.But when we examine strategic behaviour – especially the hesitation to deploy high-risk financial tools  such as using Russia’s frozen assets in Europe – we see signs of realist recalibration.The EU’s frozen assets debate has become a litmus test for Brussels’ confidence in Ukraine’s long-term viability.What are the concerns over using the assets?Belgium holds the bulk of Russia’s frozen assets  amounting to about 210 billion euros (A$374 billion) in a financial institution called Euroclear. European finance ministers have discussed using the assets as a loan to Ukraine  which would only be repaid if Russia provided reparations following the war.Brussels is insisting on legal guarantees before releasing the funds. It is also demanding collective liability shielding from other EU states  citing concerns about lawsuits filed by Russia and financial exposure.There’s a reputational risk  as well  if other countries such as China or India start to view European banks as an unreliable place to park their funds.In parallel  Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has suspended military aid to Ukraine and said his country’s goal is not Russia’s defeat  but to “end war as soon as possible”.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has gone further  saying Ukraine “cannot win on the battlefield”.Although Fico and Orbán are more pro-Russia than other EU leaders  they reflect a growing undercurrent of realist strategic thinking within the bloc.Even among more supportive states  there is growing ambiguity about the war effort. France and Germany continue to support Kyiv  but with increasing emphasis on diplomacy and “realistic expectations.”And while Poland and the Baltic states are the most vocal supporters of using Russia’s frozen assets  Germany  France and Italy have adopted a more cautious posture or demanded Ukraine commit to spending the assets on European weapons – a demand Kyiv resists.Strategic posturing is happening  tooUnavoidably  these frozen assets are not merely financial – they are a geopolitical wager. To deploy them now is to bet on Ukraine’s victory. To delay is to preserve flexibility in case Russia prevails or the war ends in a frozen stalemate.In 2022  supporting Ukraine was framed as a moral imperative. By late 2025  some now see it as a strategic liability.As is invariably the case in international politics  moral aspirations give way to strategic imperatives when the geopolitical push comes to shove. As war fatigue is rising across Europe  many Ukrainians are wondering if Europe still cares.These concerns are amplified by the shifting battlefield: the key transit city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is under siege and Russian forces are advancing in Huliaipole in the south. Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is being systematically dismantled by Russian drone strikes.Skala  425th Separate Assault Regiment/APThis also explains the hesitance of EU leaders about releasing Russian frozen assets. Aside from the legal concerns  questions are increasingly being asked about the trajectory of the war. Could the EU risk billions of euros on a failed cause  while forfeiting leverage in postwar negotiations?From an international politics perspective  this classic realist logic and the widening gap between ethics and interstate relations are neither new nor surprising: states act in their interests  not in service of ideals.The frozen assets are being treated not as aid  but as a bargaining chip – to be deployed only if Ukraine stabilises the situation on the battlefield or if Russia can be pressured into concession.By delaying a decision on the frozen assets  the EU preserves optionality. If Ukraine regains ground  the assets can be deployed with stronger justification. If Russia ultimately prevails  the EU avoids being seen as the architect of a failed financial intervention.This ambiguity is not indecision – it’s strategic posture. The EU is hedging its bets  quietly preparing for multiple outcomes. The longer the war drags on  the more likely unity fractures and realism overtake idealism.No perfect outcomesA final decision on the assets is expected in December. But even if approved  the funds may be disbursed in cautious tranches  tied to battlefield developments and political optics  locking Ukraine into the unforgiving calculus of great power rivalry between Russia and the West.The EU is not abandoning Ukraine  but it is recalibrating its risk exposure. That recalibration is grounded in strategic doubt as EU leaders are no longer sure Ukraine can win – even if they won’t say so aloud.In the end  whether or not the assets are deployed  Ukraine’s outlook remains bleak unless both Russia and the West find a way to de-escalate their zero-sum rivalry in the region.Any future settlement is unlikely to be optimal and will likely disappoint Ukrainians. But the current challenge is not to pursue perfect outcomes  which no longer exist  but to choose the least damaging path to ending the war  among all the imperfect options.,neutral,0.01,0.88,0.11,negative,0.0,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'decision', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'bets', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán', 'Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico', '425th Separate Assault Regiment/AP', 'key transit city', 'great power rivalry', 'classic realist logic', 'Russian drone strikes', 'Most European heads', 'European finance ministers', 'high-risk financial tools', 'international politics perspective', 'realist strategic thinking', 'frozen assets debate', 'other EU leaders', 'other EU states', 'Russian frozen assets', 'other countries', 'Russian forces', 'European Union', 'European banks', 'European weapons', 'frozen stalemate', 'Russian assets', 'financial liability', 'financial institution', 'financial exposure', 'financial intervention', 'realist recalibration', 'grinding offensive', 'legal caution', 'uncomfortable truth', 'public rhetoric', 'territorial integrity', 'strategic behaviour', 'litmus test', 'long-term viability', 'legal guarantees', 'collective liability', 'reputational risk', 'unreliable place', 'growing undercurrent', 'supportive states', 'increasing emphasis', 'realistic expectations', 'Baltic states', 'vocal supporters', 'cautious posture', 'Strategic posturing', 'geopolitical wager', 'moral imperative', 'strategic liability', 'moral aspirations', 'strategic imperatives', 'geopolitical push', 'many Ukrainians', 'energy infrastructure', 'postwar negotiations', 'widening gap', 'interstate relations', 'bargaining chip', 'stronger justification', 'strategic posture', 'multiple outcomes', 'unity fractures', 'perfect outcomes', 'cautious tranches', 'political optics', 'unforgiving calculus', 'risk exposure', 'The EU', 'straightforward decision', '140 billion euros', '210 billion euros', 'final decision', 'Brussels’ confidence', 'military aid', 'growing ambiguity', 'shifting battlefield', 'battlefield developments', 'war effort', 'war fatigue', 'legal concerns', 'Ukraine braces', 'eastern Ukraine', 'winter', 'Kyiv', 'delay', 'surface', 'sovereignty', 'hesitation', 'signs', 'Belgium', 'bulk', 'loan', 'reparations', 'funds', 'lawsuits', 'China', 'India', 'parallel', 'country', 'goal', 'defeat', 'bloc', 'France', 'Germany', 'diplomacy', 'Poland', 'Italy', 'demand', 'victory', 'flexibility', 'case', 'late', 'way', 'Pokrovsk', 'siege', 'Huliaipole', 'south', 'Skala', 'hesitance', 'questions', 'trajectory', 'billions', 'cause', 'leverage', 'ethics', 'interests', 'service', 'ideals', 'situation', 'concession', 'optionality', 'ground', 'architect', 'failed', 'indecision', 'bets', 'realism', 'idealism', 'December', 'West']",2025-11-16,2025-11-17,theconversation.com

Since Sunday  November 16  this activation has been shining all along the Avenue des Champs-Élysées: 400 illuminated trees and 200 kakemonos with the Swarovski logo dress the 2 kilometres separating the Arc de Triomphe from the Place de la Concorde. To extend the brilliance  JCDecaux  the number one outdoor advertising and street furniture company worldwide  proposed a large-scale media plan including posters on bus shelters and kiosks in the capital.As part of this collaboration  an exclusive and unique pop-up store has opened its doors at 1 Place Charles de Gaulle  in front of the Arc de Triomphe. Accessible only during the Holiday Season Illuminations  from this Sunday until December 26  it offers visitors the opportunity to discover the collections of jewellery and interior decoration items of the Swarovski Maison.This Sunday  November 16 at 6:30 p.m.  the Illuminations of the Champs-Elysées kicked off  marking the beginning of the festive season in Paris. With Mr. Marc-Antoine JAMET  President of the Comité Champs-Elysées  the Mayor of Paris  Anne HIDALGO  Mrs. Myriam BATONI  Managing Director France-Benelux of Swarovski  two children made their dream come true when they flicked the switch  thanks to the association Les Petits Princes  accompanied by Léa SEYDOUX  godmother of the 2025 edition of the Illuminations. This edition has been reinvented  offering a show with a brand new ""sound and light"" experience  thanks to the integration of innovative LED technology  which can be monitored  programmed and dimmed. It has been designed by Blachère  managed by Thierry Reboul and illuminated by Thomas Dechandon  a great lighting designer who participated in the staging of Starmania  awarded two Molières in 2023.As every year and for 7 weeks  from November 16  2025 to January 5  2026  the Illuminations of the Champs-Élysées will make the most beautiful avenue in the world shine  amazing Parisians and visitors from all over the world. In 2024  more than 150 000 people attended the inauguration of the Illuminations  between the Arc de Triomphe and the Obelisk of the Concorde. The same magic operated on December 31  when more than one million people gathered to celebrate New Year’s Eve with the fireworks show.Marc-Antoine Jamet  President of Comité Champs-Elysées  said: ""There are events that Paris offers to France and to the whole world  traditions like the Oldies Holiday Display window of department stores  which create memories for generations and generations of children. These exceptional events can only take place on the ""Most Beautiful Avenue in the World"". This is the case with the Illuminations of the Champs-Élysées. This year  to preserve the magic  to magnify the event  we have transformed everything. New godmother  new technologies  new philosophy  new podium  new protocol. Loyal attendees  tourists  strollers or bystanders  undoubtedly  there will be many people to come and admire these new features. Let us reassure them. Yes  the event will worthily extend the Illuminations of previous years! Yes  with Léa Seydoux  we will find the glamour  the elegance  the magic that she brings to world cinema! Yes  with Thierry Reboul  Thomas Dechandon  Victor Le Masne  the first ""sound and light"" show in the history of the Champs-Elysées will live up to expectations. Yes  Charlotte Cardin's show  more flamboyant than ever  will score a try!But behind a free show  you need a benefactor. He came to JCDecaux  our partner  and to the team of this beautiful French company that is accompanying us for the 12th consecutive year. Swarovski has decided to be that patron  that sponsor that makes everything possible and easy. We thank them for that. Their name along with ours will appear on all the posters and on all the kakemonos. For the one who  by cutting the crystal to perfection  is celebrating his 130th birthday this year  a special salute was needed. The Illuminations will therefore dangle the name in a gold loop every evening  while a Swarovski pop-up will be installed on one of the musoirs of the Place de l'Étoile. This had never been done previously for the Comité’s Illuminations. It is also a first! We look forward to seeing you there with JCDecaux  Havas and Blachère  solid partners  friendly partners of the Comité Champs-Élysées.”Jean Muller  Executive Vice President Sales  Marketing and Development FLIB (France  Luxembourg  Israel and Belgium) at JCDecaux  said: "" True to our mission to make the city more beautiful through our product and service innovation  in partnership with the Comité Champs-Elysées  which we thank for its trust  we are pleased to support Swarovski and to participate  alongside Blachère  to the lighting of ""the most beautiful avenue in the world"". The know-how and expertise of JCDecaux's teams  attentive to the expectations of its partners  led to design a project combining refinement  impact and responsible innovation  that will enhance the image of Swarovski in a unique way. The Illuminations will delight Parisians and visitors from all over the world  and  once again  make Paris shine more than ever during the Holiday Season. »Key Figures for JCDecaux2024 revenue: €3 935.3m – H1 2025 revenue: €1 868.3mN°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 091 811 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 894 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants12 026 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the SBF 120 and CAC Mid 60 indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (11.9)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (629 737 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 157 airports and 257 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 848 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (83 472 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (736 310 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (178 010 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (89 526 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (22 490 advertising panels)N°2 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (20 689 advertising panels)For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com.Join us on X  LinkedIn  Facebook  Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Clémentine Prat+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – clementine.prat@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment",neutral,0.06,0.94,0.0,positive,0.83,0.17,0.0,True,English,"['Comité Champs-Elysées', '2025 Illuminations', 'JCDecaux', 'Swarovski', 'partnership', 'Oldies Holiday Display window', '1 Place Charles de Gaulle', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'Place de la Concorde', 'Arc de Triomphe', 'street furniture company', 'Léa SEYDOUX', 'large-scale media plan', 'interior decoration items', 'Mrs. Myriam BATONI', 'Managing Director France-Benelux', 'Les Petits Princes', 'innovative LED technology', 'great lighting designer', 'Victor Le Masne', 'beautiful French company', 'Champs-Élysées', 'unique pop-up store', 'two Molières', 'new magical operation', 'Mr. Marc-Antoine JAMET', '12th consecutive year', 'Comité Champs-Elysées', 'one million people', 'Most Beautiful Avenue', 'Holiday Season illuminations', 'festive season', 'New Year', 'new technologies', 'new philosophy', 'new podium', 'new protocol', 'new features', 'prestigious brands', '400 illuminated trees', 'bus shelters', 'Anne HIDALGO', 'two children', 'Blachère', 'Thierry Reboul', 'Thomas Dechandon', 'amazing Parisians', 'department stores', 'Loyal attendees', 'many people', 'previous years', 'Charlotte Cardin', '130th birthday', 'special salute', 'gold loop', 'solid p', 'Swarovski pop-up', 'light"" experience', 'fireworks show', 'free show', 'exceptional events', 'first ""sound', 'New godmother', 'The Illuminations', 'Swarovski logo', 'Swarovski Maison', 'same magic', 'JCDecaux SE', 'light"" show', 'Euronext Paris', 'world cinema', 'exclusive partner', 'JCDecaux France', '150,000 people', '2025 Illuminations', 'partnership', '16th', 'number', 'creation', 'Master', 'Sunday', 'November', 'activation', '200 kakemonos', '2 kilometres', 'brilliance', 'posters', 'kiosks', 'capital', 'collaboration', 'doors', 'front', 'December', 'visitors', 'opportunity', 'collections', 'jewellery', 'beginning', 'President', 'Mayor', 'dream', 'switch', 'association', '2025 edition', 'integration', 'staging', 'Starmania', '7 weeks', 'January', 'inauguration', 'Obelisk', 'traditions', 'memories', 'generations', 'case', 'everything', 'tourists', 'strollers', 'bystanders', 'glamour', 'elegance', 'history', 'expectations', 'benefactor', 'team', 'patron', 'sponsor', 'name', 'crystal', 'perfection', 'musoirs', 'Étoile', 'Havas', '6:30']",2025-11-16,2025-11-17,globenewswire.com
