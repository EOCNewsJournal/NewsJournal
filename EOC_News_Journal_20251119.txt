53771,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/627942-zelensky-corrupt-rafale-deal/,Is Zelensky finally corrupt enough for the biggest Rafale deal of all time?,France gleefully ignores the massive graft scandal gripping Kiev as it announces its intent to sell 100 fighter jets to Ukraine Read Full Article at RT.com,France gleefully ignores the massive graft scandal gripping Kiev as it announces its intent to sell 100 fighter jets to UkraineWill the 100 fighter jets that French President Emmanuel Macron has just promised Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky arrive in time to kick off World War III?Europe’s favorite girlfriend  Zelensky  arrived in Paris on Monday  in the wake of the city lighting up its annual Christmas decorations on the Champs Elysees. Guess he heard that Santa Claus was coming and wanted to take an early spin on his lap.Cast in the role is Macron  who pulled out a “letter of intention” to supply Kiev with up to 100 French Rafale fighter jets. Both signed it. Rafales are the second-most expensive fighter jets in the world  and to date  this many have never been sold to a single buyer before.The agreement so far is not binding as to any eventual sale  but letters of intention can contain binding exclusivity or “no-shop” clauses  the breach of which can lead to damages being awarded for the loss of pre-contract expenses. These don’t amount to very much  relatively speaking. But the real value in it for Zelensky and Macron is to stick it to Donald Trump. Because Trump keeps saying that he’ll supply weapons to Ukraine by basically turning the EU into a franchise for the US defense industry: they’d purchase American weapons for Kiev and then hand them over.This move makes it clear that the EU will instead be buying European weapons for Ukraine. Which is a huge middle finger to Trump’s obvious self-serving strategy of hiking NATO country spending demands to 5% of GDP so they have more cash to spend on US weapons under the guise of needing to protect themselves from their obsession over Vladimir Putin arriving in 2035. (The specific date conveniently gives them enough of a fiscal runway to thoroughly rinse out the pockets of their own taxpayers for this grift.)NATO countries have been indulging in some real idiocy lately in an attempt to shove as much of their budget as possible into the “defense spending” category to meet Trump’s 5%.Canada recently proposed training 300 000 federal civil servants to “shoot guns  drive trucks  and fly drones ” according to the Ottawa Citizen citing a “defense department directive.” Perhaps that would allow the government to classify as military spending the salaries of any future heat-packers at agencies and departments like the National Arts Center  the Canada Pension Plan  Revenue Canada  and the Canadian Race Relations Foundation.Similarly  Italy is building a bridge to Sicily that it’s classifying as military  just because troops could also use it  which has inspired Germany to do the same with its own civilian bridge and road projects.So these countries were already performing ridiculous charades in an attempt to make Trump’s defense spending demands work to their own benefit. Now Macron has taken it a step further by getting Zelensky to commit to defense purchasing exclusivity to the overt detriment of the American weapons industry and the benefit of Europe’s.Minor problem  though: who’s paying? The average French citizen would really like to know. We’re talking about $10 billion here. Online comments about this announcement have rightfully underscored that neither France nor Ukraine has the cash for it. Even if Macron takes half of the approximately 200 fighter jets from the French Air Force and hands them over like he’s blowing out the closet for the season as an excuse to load it up with shiny new stuff  those planes still cost about $100 million each to make and take about three years to replace. Again  who would be paying for France’s new duds and covering for any security nakedness?The whole thing sounds incredibly scammy. Speaking of which  we literally just finished hearing nonstop about how Ukraine just magically discovered that its nuclear power sector was handing out contracts like a nightclub bouncer handles the crowd outside on the sidewalk. Pay a bribe and skip the line. Don’t pay  and you can just keep hanging out behind the velvet rope  straining your neck to see all the other guys inside doing business. But guess who doesn’t really care? EU leaders  apparently.Macron just gave the whole thing a big Gallic shrug when he invited Zelensky to come hang out to discuss what the Elysee called “bilateral cooperation  notably in the domains of energy  economy and defense.” Energy and defense? Great – one sector in which Ukraine has a fresh $100 million scandal  and another that virtually runs on corruption.Did Macron just see the recent scandal in the Ukrainian energy sector as a prerequisite for doing business? “You’re finally corrupt enough for us to cooperate!” All this happens to be unfolding just as another French company  Holcim (formerly Lafarge)  goes on trial in France for alleged kickbacks to ISIS head-choppers in Syria.Let’s face it – France is already being spanked regularly by Queen Ursula von der Leyen herself over its soaring debt. So clearly it doesn’t have the cash for this. But the entire EU has been trying to figure out how to avoid having to spend any of its own money on potential Ukrainian scams – defense or otherwise – by just stealing Russia’s money that they were “safekeeping” in European banks and letting Ukraine blow that instead. Basically  they’re looking to turn Russia into an unwitting high roller at the gambling table and cast the EU as the bimbo who would be making all these bold betting moves with Russia’s cash. Which doesn’t sound like a great idea to the outfit that could be held liable for it  Belgian-based Euroclear  which has recently entertained the idea of suing the EU over their robbery plans  according to Le Monde.Right now  even the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) is going like  “Yeah  about that loan tab that we have open for Ukraine? We’re gonna close it if it looks like someone else can’t pay it.” The guy bumming around the planet  looking like an Amazon delivery driver whose uniform is permanently in the wash  doesn’t exactly inspire confidence that he’ll return your borrowed lawnmower  let alone billions in loaned cash.If there’s an upside to all of this  it’s that it doesn’t look like those Rafales will be in the air over Ukraine to start World War III anytime soon. This is little more than an engagement party designed to make Trump jealous. But Macron  Zelensky  and the extended EU family still have no idea how to pay for this wedding.,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,mixed,0.07,0.25,0.68,True,English,"['biggest Rafale deal', 'Zelensky', 'time', 'Queen Ursula von der Leyen', 'Canadian Race Relations Foundation', 'NATO country spending demands', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', '100 French Rafale fighter jets', 'Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky', 'defense spending demands', 'French Air Force', 'annual Christmas decorations', 'huge middle finger', 'obvious self-serving strategy', '300,000 federal civil servants', 'National Arts Center', 'big Gallic shrug', 'defense spending” category', 'average French citizen', 'massive graft scandal', 'nuclear power sector', 'fresh $100 million scandal', 'shiny new stuff', 'defense department directive', 'expensive fighter jets', 'World War III', 'Canada Pension Plan', 'US defense industry', 'defense purchasing exclusivity', 'Ukrainian energy sector', 'American weapons industry', '100 fighter jets', '200 fighter jets', 'French company', 'Vladimir Putin', 'one sector', 'recent scandal', 'binding exclusivity', 'US weapons', 'NATO countries', 'Ottawa Citizen', 'new duds', 'favorite girlfriend', 'Champs Elysees', 'Santa Claus', 'early spin', 'single buyer', 'eventual sale', 'pre-contract expenses', 'real value', 'European weapons', 'fiscal runway', 'real idiocy', 'future heat-packers', 'Revenue Canada', 'road projects', 'ridiculous charades', 'overt detriment', 'Minor problem', 'Online comments', 'three years', 'security nakedness', 'nightclub bouncer', 'velvet rope', 'other guys', 'ISIS head-choppers', 'soaring debt', 'specific date', 'civilian bridge', 'EU leaders', 'entire EU', 'Donald Trump', 'France', 'Kiev', 'intent', 'Ukraine', 'time', 'Paris', 'Monday', 'wake', 'city', 'lap', 'role', 'letter', 'up', 'Rafales', 'agreement', 'shop', 'clauses', 'breach', 'damages', 'loss', 'franchise', 'move', 'GDP', 'cash', 'guise', 'obsession', 'pockets', 'taxpayers', 'grift', 'attempt', 'budget', 'guns', 'trucks', 'drones', 'government', 'military', 'salaries', 'agencies', 'departments', 'Italy', 'Sicily', 'troops', 'Germany', 'benefit', 'announcement', 'half', 'closet', 'season', 'excuse', 'planes', 'thing', 'nonstop', 'contracts', 'crowd', 'sidewalk', 'bribe', 'neck', 'business', 'domains', 'economy', 'Great', 'prerequisite', 'Holcim', 'Lafarge', 'trial', 'kickbacks', 'Syria']",2025-11-18,2025-11-19,rt.com

The roll-out began in March 2024 after a 2-year manufacturing process to gradually replace the previous models. Together with its partners Enedis and Eau de Paris  JCDecaux has replaced around 7 toilets per week across the capital’s neighbourhoods  ensuring a consistently high level of service in every arrondissement.A strong mobilisation of the teams to deliver technological and industrial excellence for the City of Paris  Parisians and visitors alike.JCDecaux’s site teams worked around the clock  six days a week  to replace 417 toilets in just 18 months (with a forecast of 18 new sites planned to reach a total of 435 toilets) and successfully met numerous challenges  including:A rapid deployment of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games sites ahead of the opening ceremony;Maintaining a 90% availability rate across the entire network during the building works;Reusing 100% of existing locations  infrastructure and networks  each site having been inspected during the product design phase;An innovative method developed with Enedis for reconnecting live power networks  reducing on-site intervention times and maintaining a high level of service continuity throughout the works.Throughout the project  JCDecaux and its partners have prioritised Parisians and visitors. The removal and installation of the toilets were carried out at night to avoid disrupting traffic or pedestrian flow  while service continuity was ensured with a service rate above 98% and more than 3 000 maintenance interventions per week.Higher-capacity toilets meeting growing public use.Enhancing access to sanitation in public spaces for everyone  usage of these new self-cleaning public toilets  which offer double the capacity and four times the service availability of the previous models  has increased significantly  with nearly 2.5 million uses per month across the network:1 million for the cabin (average of 85 uses per toilet per day)1.5 million for the urinal (average of 115 uses per toilet per day)While 17.7 million uses were recorded across 2024  18 million were registered between January and September 2025 alone.JCDecaux: world leader in self-cleaning public toilets.Public toilets  due to their specific requirements  are not street furniture like any other. Their operation demands in-depth understanding of user behaviour combined with expertise in design and operation. Drawing on this unrivalled expertise  JCDecaux operates the two largest self-cleaning public toilet contracts in the world — Paris and Berlin  with 435 and 278 units respectively. The Group operates more than 2 500 self-cleaning public toilets in 28 countries  welcoming over 30 million users each year. These facilities form an integral part of the urban landscape worldwide. From Paris to Berlin  via Marseille  San Francisco  Stockholm  Abidjan or Lagos  JCDecaux provides street furniture and associated services that evolve with their environment and with changing needs.In the United States  our mission is to deliver first-class sanitation services that make urban spaces friendlier  safer  and accessible to everyone. For nearly 30 years  we have supported the City of San Francisco with our self-cleaning public toilets that clean and sanitise after every use  ensuring reliability and safety for residents and visitors. Our dedicated local team manages all ongoing maintenance and operations  backed by an innovative financing model where advertising revenue from kiosks covers the installation and maintenance  keeping the toilets in a state of good repair. This means uninterrupted service at no cost to taxpayers  and a proven track record of long-term commitment to public well-being.Other projects are underway across the country to further improve access to hygiene facilities in urban areas:Chicago: as part of a programme that until now did not include public toilets  JCDecaux will take part in a pilot project  installing a free of charge self-cleaning public toilet in early 2026;New York: JCDecaux has committed to doubling its number of self-cleaning public toilets to a total of 40 across the city  with seven already installed.Jean-Charles Decaux  Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “When JCDecaux invented the self-cleaning toilet in 1980  this showed the vision and pioneering approach of the company and importantly started a revolution to open up access for everyone to hygiene facilities in urban areas. We are extremely proud to have successfully deployed the new generation of self-cleaning public toilets for the City of Paris — an outstanding industrial and operational achievement. I warmly thank all our teams and partners who were fully committed at every stage of this project.

These single-celled microorganisms are now at the heart of one of agriculture’s latest biological innovation – a bio-fungicide capable of protecting wheat and other cereal crops from crippling fungal diseases that cost global agriculture billions of dollars in annual crop losses and quality.This new development  made from the lysate of the amoeba Willaertia magna C2c Maky  holds strong potential to advance biological crop protection. In trials  the candidate demonstrated its effectiveness in combating the fungi responsible for these fungal diseases and helped activate the plants' defence responses. As a next‑generation biological  it is built on a biological active substance and designed to fit modern integrated crop management.Syngenta Crop Protection  a global leader in biologicals and other innovative crop protection technologies  and French greentech innovator Amoéba SA  have now signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop and commercialize groundbreaking biocontrol solutions for the EU and UK markets  focusing on cereals and field crops. The parties plan to negotiate a definitive distribution agreement with a target timeline of spring 2026.This strategic collaboration aims to offer farmers advanced biological solutions that enhance the sustainability of their farming practices  address the challenge of increasing pest resistance to existing products  and offer relief to farmers facing a shrinking toolbox of crop protection technologies.The initial focus of the partnership will be on combating the main wheat diseases  namely septoria tritici blotch (STB) and yellow rust. These two diseases are among the most economically damaging wheat diseases across Europe and the UK  impacting an estimated 9-12 million hectares of wheat annually. In Germany alone  STB causes yield losses of 5-50% and costs of €1.5 billion annually  while yellow rust can reduce yields by 10-70% and even lead to total crop failure in susceptible varieties  according to recognized industry and academic sources.Matthew Pickard  Syngenta’s Head of Seedcare and Biologicals for Europe  said: “At Syngenta  we are committed to deliver advanced  effective biological solutions at the cutting edge of science. We’re proud to work with Amoéba to offer nature-inspired solutions that empower farmers in these important markets.”“We are very pleased with the collaboration with Syngenta  a global leader in agricultural innovation ” affirms Benoit Villers  Chaiman of the Board of Amoéba and Jean-François Doucet  CEO of Amoéba. ""This agreement  which should lead to distribution and development partnerships between our two companies  is a major step forward for Amoéba. It gives us the opportunity to combine our scientific expertise with Syngenta's widely recognised leadership in cereal protection and the marketing of biocontrol solutions. Finally  it perfectly illustrates how collaboration between innovators in the sector can make a difference for farmers while paving the way for broader applications in field crops.""Founded in 2010  Amoéba has developed a patented biocontrol application based on lysate from the amoeba Willaertia magna  which received the prestigious Bernard Blum Gold Medal in October 2025 as the most promising biocontrol solution worldwide. In June 2025  the active substance received EU approval following EFSA’s scientific assessment and a European Commission decision.
