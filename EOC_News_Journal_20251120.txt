While viral vectors such as AAV6 are commonly used for gene insertion  they raise safety and efficacy concerns. Over the past decade  non-viral DNA templates delivery has emerged as promising alternatives and have been used with nucleases to target short single-stranded linear DNA corrective template in HSPCs.Although non-viral approaches were initially limited to making only small corrections within defective genes  Cellectis harnessed its TALEN® technology and CssDNA donor templates  to develop a robust gene insertion process. This process enables precise and efficient integration of large genetic sequences within therapeutically relevant subpopulations of HSPCs  significantly expanding the potential of non-viral gene therapy.The results show that:CssDNA achieved 3-5 times higher knock-in efficiency than linear single stranded DNA (LssDNA)  with values surpassing 40%.CssDNA can be used to insert genes at multiple loci in HSPCs and is applicable to other cell types of therapeutic interest  including primary T cells.Comparative studies also showed that CssDNA-edited HSPCs demonstrate a higher propensity to engraft and maintain gene edits in a murine model compared to AAV6-edited HSPCs.“These results establish the CssDNA process as an efficient non-viral gene insertion strategy  and mark a pivotal advance towards the development of next-generation cell and gene therapies” said Julien Valton  Vice President of Gene Therapy of Cellectis.The article is available on Nature Communications website here.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies. The company utilizes an allogeneic approach for CAR T immunotherapies in oncology  pioneering the concept of off-the-shelf and ready to use gene-edited CAR T-cells to treat cancer patients  and a platform to develop gene therapies in other therapeutic indications.

Well  this is about delivering it.”The European Commission is primed to propose a sweeping package of financial markets reforms on Dec. 3  including the supervision plans  in a bid to revive Brussels' faltering decade-long campaign to create a U.S.-style capital market.According to plans first reported by POLITICO  as well as draft documents outlining the proposal  the supervision plan would considerably strengthen the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to police the likes of Nasdaq Europe and Euronext. The draft also proposes making the future watchdog independent of meddling EU capitals.Although the main aim of a single watchdog is to boost the EU’s economy by making it easier for finance firms to operate and invest across the EU’s 27 countries  having money flowing so freely around the bloc would also create new risks without strong oversight.In the event of a meltdown of a firm  such as a clearinghouse  that operates across multiple countries  an EU watchdog could be quicker to jump on the problem than a group of national supervisors acting independently.The focus on boosting Europe's capital markets has gathered pace since the pandemic's bruising impact on national budgets  compounded by the EU's desperate bid to keep pace with the economic powerhouses of the U.S. and China.,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,positive,0.93,0.07,0.0,True,English,"['US-style financial market', 'EU capitals', 'top official', 'power', 'U.S.-style capital market', ""Brussels' faltering decade-long campaign"", 'The European Commission', 'financial markets reforms', 'capital markets', 'European Securities', 'Markets Authority', 'difficult discussion', 'tremendous support', 'investments union', 'sweeping package', 'supervision plan', 'future watchdog', 'main aim', 'single watchdog', 'finance firms', 'new risks', 'strong oversight', 'national supervisors', 'bruising impact', 'national budgets', 'economic powerhouses', 'Nasdaq Europe', 'multiple countries', 'desperate bid', 'EU capitals', 'EU watchdog', 'plans', '27 countries', 'Albuquerque', 'savings', 'Dec.', 'POLITICO', 'draft', 'documents', 'proposal', 'ESMA', 'likes', 'Euronext', 'economy', 'money', 'bloc', 'event', 'meltdown', 'clearinghouse', 'problem', 'group', 'focus', 'pace', 'pandemic', 'China']",2025-11-19,2025-11-20,politico.eu

53809,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4129852.html,Novotel Becomes First Hospitality Brand to Join Seafood Task Force,Novotel  a leading global hotel brand with 600 hotels in 68 countries  has become the first hospitality brand to join the Seafood Task Force (STF).,Novotel  a leading global hotel brand with 600 hotels in 68 countries  has become the first hospitality brand to join the Seafood Task Force (STF).This milestone reinforces Novotel's leadership in sustainable hospitality and builds upon the brand's comprehensive three-year ocean commitment and partnership with WWF  launched in June 2024.The collaboration with the STF will initially focus on enhancing supply chain transparency and promoting the sustainable sourcing of tuna and farmed shrimp across three key Southeast Asian markets - Thailand  Vietnam  and Indonesia - engaging Novotel hotels in the region. These commodities were identified as priorities by mapping Novotel's key sourcing volumes against regions with elevated sustainability and social risks.The STF brings together members of global tuna and shrimp supply chains  serving more than 350 million customers globally and helping businesses enhance supply chain oversight and ensure ethical production from vessel to plate. All STF members work to produce fully traceable  ethically produced  and environmentally responsible seafood  meeting international social and environmental standards  while advancing industry-wide due diligence requirements.Novotel's membership extends the brand's Sustainable Seafood Principles  which were introduced earlier this year in collaboration with WWF France. These principles include banning more than 350 endangered seafood species from menus by 2027  serving only MSC-certified wild-caught species or responsibly sourced local fish  and using ASC- or organic-certified farmed seafood for salmon and shrimp.Joining the Seafood Task Force represents a critical next step in Novotel's journey toward complete seafood traceability and sustainability. We are proud to lead the industry in taking concrete action to protect our oceans by becoming the first hospitality brand to become a member. Through our partnership with the STF  our teams across Southeast Asia will have access to world-class expertise and practical tools to drive meaningful change in how we source tuna and farmed shrimp. This commitment is embedded in our broader ocean roadmap  which aims to make Novotel best-in-class in reducing environmental impact.

They accelerate go-to-market due to lower dependencies on central expert teams to generate data insights from new data sources. The solution also lowers operational costs by up to 35% by leveraging DataOps agents that help reduce the average ticket-handling time.

The interim consolidated financial statements3 were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting today.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “Q2’26 performance was in line with our expectations and reflects the dynamics of the first half: strong momentum in Edge & Cloud AI  continued inventory correction in Mobile Communications  and a lackluster Automotive market.We took specific actions to improve Soitec’s cash generation  while we are still going through customer inventory depletion  and we are strengthening the efforts started in H1’26. In these uncertain times  financial discipline is of the essence  as evidenced by H1’26 numbers.Progress on the innovation front accelerates the diversification of our product portfolio. Our new client- and product-centric organization ensures a tighter alignment between innovation  product roadmaps  and customer needs  strengthening Soitec’s readiness to expand into new SOI and beyond-SOI end markets and applications. The company’s growth potential remains intact in an addressable market poised to expand at a double-digit pace.”Second quarter FY26 consolidated revenueQ2’26 Q2’25 Q2’26/Q2’25 (Euro millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 76 124 -38% -39% Automotive & Industrial 11 33 -68% -68% Edge & Cloud AI 52 61 -14% -9%* Revenue 139 217 -36% -36%* Excluding impact of anticipated Imager-SOI phase-out ($7m in Q2’25): Edge & Cloud AI division down -5% y/y organicSoitec revenue reached 139 million Euros in Q2’26  down 36% both on a reported basis and organic compared with 217 million Euros in Q2’25. The divestment of Dolphin Design’s businesses4 had a 1-point negative scope impact  while the currency effect was immaterial. As anticipated and in line with the guidance provided in July 2025  Q2’26 organic revenue grew by 47% sequentially.Mobile CommunicationsMobile Communications revenue reached 76 million Euros in Q2’26  down 39% year-on-year organic but up 72% sequentially organic. The division’s performance reflects lower RF-SOI shipments. Following the seasonal restocking in Q4’25  RF-SOI inventories at foundries remain high. RF-SOI sales rebounded from Q1’26  though well below Q2’25 levels.POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafer sales decreased year-on-year and sequentially  reflecting weaker demand in Asia. Despite this short-term softness  POI continues to establish itself as the reference substrate for advanced Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters. With 11 customers in production and 12 in qualification  POI adoption keeps expanding among major fabless companies worldwide  with new design wins for US flagship smartphones.FD-SOI wafer sales increased sequentially but remained slightly below Q2’25. Adoption continues to progress  supported by initial design wins for Wi-Fi 7 SoCs in premium Android smartphones  confirming Soitec’s positioning in next-generation communication architectures.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 11 million Euros in Q2’26  down 68% year-on-year organic. While up 121% sequentially organic  activity remains at a low level  with the increase mainly reflecting a base effect rather than a recovery of demand.Following the restocking observed in Q4’25  sales of Power-SOI wafers  used in smart power management for EVs continued to be affected by excess customer inventories. Q2’26 sales were well below Q2’25 levels. Soitec is actively preparing the transition to 300mm to meet growing demand for Battery Management Systems (BMS) and other vehicle electrification applications.FD-SOI wafer sales also remained below Q2’25 levels. FD-SOI adoption for ADAS is progressing  as the technology proves increasingly valuable for analog and mixed-signal edge computing used in radars  microcontrollers  and wireless connectivity.Market perspectives for SmartSiCTM substrates have been reviewed downwards as a result of intensified competition from Chinese players  particularly from monocrystalline SiC (monoSiC) products. Notwithstanding  Soitec is in the process of qualifying five customers. While Soitec is seeing growing interest in SmartSiCTM ability to enhance power supply efficiency in next-generation data centers  these opportunities are not expected to materialize in the short term.Edge & Cloud AIDriven by the exponential growth in AI-related computing power  momentum for Soitec’s Edge & Cloud AI division remained very favorable  at the Edge  where demand for low-power computing devices and embedded AI applications continues to expand  and in the Cloud  where the need for more powerful and energy-efficient data centers is accelerating.Edge & Cloud AI revenue reached 52 million Euros in Q2’26  down 14% year-on-year on a reported basis  including the negative scope effect from the divestment of Dolphin Design’s businesses. Organic revenue declined by 9% year-on-year but increased by 14% sequentially  supported by strong demand for FD-SOI and Photonics-SOI substrates used in AI applications across Edge and Cloud environments. Excluding the impact of the anticipated Imager-SOI phase-out  the division’s revenue was down 5% year-on-year organic.Photonics-SOI sales were significantly above Q2’25 levels  driven by major industry investments in AI data infrastructure. The technology continues to stand out as the optimal solution for high-speed  high-bandwidth optical interconnects  including pluggable transceivers and Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) systems.FD-SOI sales were broadly stable year-on-year and significantly higher sequentially. FD-SOI technology remains a key enabler for AI-driven consumer  industrial  and healthcare IoT applications  offering unique advantages in power efficiency  performance  thermal management  and reliability.Imager-SOI sales reflected the ongoing phase-out of the first-generation 3D imaging products  initiated in early FY25. A late purchase order in Q2’26 generated a few million Euros in sales  a lower level than in Q2’25. For reference  Imager-SOI contributed around 32 million Dollars in H1’25 and recorded no sales in H2’25 and Q1’26.H1’26 consolidated revenueH1’26 H1’25 H1’26/H1’25 (Euro millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 119 172 -31% -30% Automotive & Industrial 15 59 -74% -74% Edge & Cloud AI 96 107 -10% -1%* Revenue 231 338 -32% -29%* Excluding impact of anticipated Imager-SOI phase-out ($32m in H1’25): Edge & Cloud AI division up +34% y/y organicSoitec consolidated revenue reached 231 million Euros in H1’26  down 32% on a reported basis and 29% organic year-on-year.Mobile Communications revenue totaled 119 million Euros  down 31% on a reported basis and 30% organic  year-on-year  impacted by persistently high RF-SOI inventories at certain customers.Automotive & Industrial revenue amounted to 15 million Euros  down 74% both on a reported basis and organic  year-on-year  reflecting weak market conditions and excess inventories across the automotive value chain  leading to lower Power-SOI and FD-SOI volumes.Edge & Cloud AI revenue reached 96 million Euros  down 10% on a reported basis but stable organic  as the phase-out of Imager-SOI wafers was offset by higher sales of Photonics-SOI and FD-SOI substrates supporting AI-related applications  both at the Edge and in the Cloud. Excluding the anticipated Imager-SOI phase-out  the division’s revenue grew by 34% year-on-year organic.EBITDA margin maintained at a robust levelConsolidated income statement (part 1)(Euro millions) H1’26 H1’25 % change Revenue 231 338 -32% Gross profit 58 101 -43% As a % of revenue 25.1% 30.0% Net research and development expenses (21) (43) -51% Selling  general and administrative expenses (26) (31) -15% Current operating income 11 28 -61% As a % of revenue 4.7% 8.2% Other operating expenses (46) (4) Operating income (35) 23 EBITDA 79 113 -30% As a % of revenue 34.1% 33.4%Gross profit was 58 million Euros in H1’26 (25.1% margin)  compared with 101 million Euros (30.0% margin) in H1’25. The lower gross margin mainly reflects the deliberate reduction in production to support inventory correction  as well as a negative price / mix effect.Current operating income was 11 million Euros in H1’26 (4.7% margin)  compared with 28 million Euros (8.2% margin) in H1’25. The decline mainly reflects the lower gross profit resulting from reduced activity over the period  partly offset by lower R&D expenses and the continued tight control of operating costs.Gross R&D costs before capitalization decreased by 30%  from 77 million Euros in H1’25 to 54 million Euros in H1’26  while net R&D costs amounted to 21 million Euros in H1’26  representing 9.0% of revenue  compared with 43 million Euros  or 12.6% of revenue  in H1’25. Soitec maintained a strong R&D effort to prepare for future growth  with no compromise on Innovation. At constant perimeter  excluding Dolphin Design SAS and excluding the capitalization of development costs  the Group’s underlying gross R&D spending is broadly stable year-on-year. The decrease in reported net R&D expenses mainly reflects the absence of Dolphin Design costs and variations in public funding and research tax credits.decreased by 30%  from 77 million Euros in H1’25 to 54 million Euros in H1’26  while net R&D costs amounted to 21 million Euros in H1’26  representing 9.0% of revenue  compared with 43 million Euros  or 12.6% of revenue  in H1’25. Soitec maintained a strong R&D effort to prepare for future growth  with no compromise on Innovation. At constant perimeter  excluding Dolphin Design SAS and excluding the capitalization of development costs  the Group’s underlying gross R&D spending is broadly stable year-on-year. The decrease in reported net R&D expenses mainly reflects the absence of Dolphin Design costs and variations in public funding and research tax credits. SG&A expenses decreased by 15%  from 31 million Euros in H1’25 (9.2% of revenue) to 26 million Euros in H1’26 (11.4% of revenue). This evolution reflects continued strict cost discipline  notably lower profit-sharing and share-based payments.Other operating expenses totaled 46 million Euros in H1’26  mainly reflecting a 41 million Euros impairment loss on Soitec’s SmartSiC™ non-current assets (capitalized development costs and tools). The Group revised the market prospects for silicon carbide (SiC) substrates downwards  particularly in the context of increasing competition from Chinese players compared to 2021 when the decision was made to build the Bernin 4 fab. Other operating expenses also include a depreciation related to the disposal of Dolphin Design  a company acquired by Soitec in 2018. As a result  Soitec recorded an operating loss of 35 million Euros in H1’26  compared with an operating profit of 23 million Euros in H1’25.EBITDA was 79 million Euros in H1’26 (113 million Euros in H1’25). The EBITDA margin increased by 70 basis points to 34.1% of revenue  up from 33.4% in H1’25. The EBITDA margin improvement mainly reflects the comparison with a smaller revenue base and a temporary increase in inventories  supported by continued volume production  while first cost efficiency measures provided a limited contribution.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euro millions) H1’26 H1’25 Current operating income 11 28 As a % of revenue 4 7% 8 2% Other operating expenses (46) (4) (o/w €41m SmartSiCTM impairment) Operating income / (loss) (35) 23 Net financial result / (loss) (22) (8) Income tax (9) (2) Net profit / (loss) from continuing operations (67) 14 Net profit / (loss)  Group share (67) 14 (o/w €41m SmartSiCTM impairment / €19m FX one-off loss) Current net profit / (loss)5 (2) 18 Basic earnings per share (in €) (1.87) 0.39 Diluted earnings per share (in €) (1.87) 0.39 Current basic earnings5 per share (in €) (0.05) 0.51 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 35 662 894 35 677 855 Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares 35 662 894 35 752 384The net financial result was a loss of 22 million Euros in H1’26 (8 million Euros in H1’25). This one-off loss recorded in Q1’26 mainly reflects a net FX loss of 19 million Euros  resulting from the revaluation of balance sheet FX exposure in Q1’26  in relation to a loan issued in FY21 and USD depreciation (company policy was to protect the Income Statement against FX exposure). Following a comprehensive review  the balance sheet FX exposure is now hedged. Net financial expenses were 6 million Euros  including 14 million Euros of interest charges partly offset by 8 million Euros of interest income  compared with net financial expenses of 2 million Euros in H1’25.Income tax expense was 9 million Euros in H1’26  compared with 2 million Euros in H1’25. Thismainly reflects the reduction of deferred tax assets recognized on tax loss carryforwards.The net result was a 67 million Euros loss in H1’26 (14 million Euros profit in H1’25). Adjusted for significant one-off events during the period (of which 41 million Euros impairment loss on Soitec’s SmartSiCTM  3 million Euros depreciation related to the disposal of Dolphin Design and 19 million Euros one-off non-cash FX loss in Q1’26) that could skew analysis of the recurring performance  current net income was a loss of 2 million Euros in H1’26 (18 million Euros profit in H1’25).Free Cash Flow6 slightly negative(Euro millions) H1’26 H1’25 Continuing operations EBITDA 79 113 Inventories (96) (75) Trade receivables 132 130 Trade payables (60) (37) Other receivables and liabilities (33) 9 Change in working capital (57) 27 Tax paid 5 (10) Net cash generated by operating activities 26 129 Capital expenditure7 (56) (120) Interest received 7 10 Interest paid (8) (7) Free Cash Flow (31) 12Starting in FY26  Soitec has reviewed and updated its definition of Free Cash Flow to align with market practices. The new definition now includes Capital expenditures  irrespective of the way they are funded (capital expenditures financed through leases were previously excluded from FCF definition)  interest paid as well as other financial charges. Based on its new definition  Free Cash Flow was negative 31 million Euros in H1’26 (positive 12 million Euros in H1’25). This reflects the combined impact of lower EBITDA  due to reduced activity  and higher cash outflows related to working capital  partly offset by lower capital expenditure.The change in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 57 million Euros in H1'26  compared with a cash inflow of 27 million Euros in H1'25. The outflow in H1’26 mainly reflects:a 96 million Euros seasonal increase in inventories built to support deliveries expected in the second part of the fiscal year a 60 million Euros decrease in trade payables and a 33 million Euros increase in net other receivables mainly due to higher tax receivables and a reduction in social security payables following the payment of variable compensation during the period partly offset by a 132 million Euros decrease in trade receivables  following the strong revenue recorded in Q4’25.Net cash used in investing activities was 42 million Euros in H1’26 (94 million Euros in H1’25). This includes 7 million Euros of financial income from cash investments (10 million Euros in H1’25). Total cash out related to capital expenditure reached 56 million Euros  including 7 million Euros of new production equipment financed under leases (17 million Euros in H1’25)  compared with 120 million Euros in H1’25. Capital expenditure was mainly dedicated to industrial investments  including manufacturing tools for SOI and POI products in Bernin and Singapore  upgrades to industrial facilities in both locations  and IT investments.Net cash generated by financing activities was 149 million Euros in H1'26 (44 million Euros used in financing activities in H1’25)  including the issuance of a 200 million Euros Schuldschein loan dedicated to refinance the 325 million Euros OCEANE 2025 convertible bonds which were repaid at maturity on October 1  2025  i.e. post H1’26 closing. The cash generated by the new loan was partly offset by a 43 million Euros decrease in borrowings (loans and leases repayment) and 8 million Euros of related interest paid.Including a negative impact of 13 million Euros from exchange rate fluctuations (4 million Euros negative impact in H1’25)  net cash inflow reached 120 million Euros in H1’26 (13 million Euros outflow in H1’25). Soitec’s cash position stood at 808 million Euros as of September 30  2025  reflecting a temporarily high level of liquidity prior to the redemption of the OCEANE 2025 convertible bonds  which occurred on October 1  2025  i.e. just after the H1’26 closing.Strong balance sheet maintainedSoitec maintained a strong balance sheet as of September 30  2025. Shareholders’ equity stood at 1.5 billion Euros  down 121 million Euros compared with March 31  2025  reflecting the net loss for the period and unfavorable currency translation effects.Financial debt totaled 953 million Euros as of September 30  2025  up from 782 million Euros at the end of March 2025  including the new 200 million Euros Schuldschein loan and prior to the redemption of the 325 million Euros OCEANE 2025 convertible bonds. Considering the 120 million Euros cash inflow recorded in H1’26  net debt8 increased by 51 million Euros  reaching 145 million Euros  compared with 94 million Euros as of March 31  2025 - a moderate leverage with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.5x.In accordance with IAS 8  Soitec retrospectively restated certain consigned raw materials as inventories  with a corresponding amount recorded as trade payables  to reflect the transfer of control upon receipt at its sites. This restatement  which has no impact on the Group’s consolidated income  EBITDA  working capital requirement  Free Cash Flow  or equity  resulted in the recognition of 37 million Euros as of March 31  2025. This amount compares with 31 million Euros of consigned inventories as of September 30  2025 (see table in Appendix).OutlookQ3’26 revenue is expected to grow mid-to-high single-digit sequentially  organic. For the rest of the fiscal year  market conditions remain challenging  particularly in Mobile Communications  where customers continue to adjust their RF-SOI inventories. Edge & Cloud AI should maintain solid momentum  supported by sustained demand for Photonics-SOI and FD-SOI wafers in AI-related applications  while Automotive & Industrial is expected to remain soft  reflecting the slow recovery of the automotive market and remaining excess inventories at certain customers.Soitec continues to implement disciplined measures to support the correction of inventories across its customer base. The Company remains focused  confident  and well positioned to execute its strategy  underpinned by targeted R&D investments  agile management of industrial capacity  stronger ecosystem partnerships  and accelerated product diversification.FY26 capital expenditure cash-out is expected to be around 140 million Euros  down from the previous indicative guidance of 150 million Euros (230 million Euros in FY25).Q2’26 key eventsIssuance of a Schuldschein loanOn July 10  2025  Soitec issued a 222 million Euros Schuldschein loan at variable rates with an average maturity of 4.0 years. Of this amount  200 million Euros were received during the first half of FY26  and 22 million Euros disbursed on October 6  2025.Soitec reached a settlement agreement for its litigation with GlobalWafersGlobalWafers previously held licenses on Soitec’s Smart Cut™ SOI patents. The Group terminated its contracts with GlobalWafers on October 31  2023  including the Smart Cut™ SOI patent license. GlobalWafers challenged this termination before the courts. In July 2025  the parties entered into a settlement agreement and agreed to terminate the supply and cross-licensing agreements dating from 2013.Post closing key eventsSoitec secured a maximum 150 million Euros financing from the European Investment Bank to support R&D and industrial investmentsOn September 10  2025  Soitec signed a financing agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to support the Group’s research and development activities and industrial investments over the 2025–2026 period. The loan  for a maximum amount of 150 million Euros  carries a two—and-a-half-year grace period followed by a ten-year amortization schedule.Soitec fully redeemed its 325 million Euros OCEANE 2025 convertible bonds at maturityOn October 1  2020  the Group issued convertible bonds (OCEANE) maturing on October 1  2025  for a total amount of 325 million Euros. The bonds were fully redeemed at maturity. This redemption was carried out in the context of strengthened liquidity  supported by the new Schuldschein and EIB financing agreements.Soitec initiates the succession process for Chief Executive Officer Pierre BarnabéOn October 1  2025  Pierre Barnabé  Chief Executive Officer of Soitec  informed the Board of Directors of his intention to leave the Group for personal reasons. Pierre Barnabé has committed to remain in his position for a period of six months until the end of the 2025-2026 fiscal year  to ensure a smooth transition. He will therefore continue in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Soitec until March 31  2026. The Board reiterated its confidence in Pierre Barnabé and the management team during this transition period. The Board of Directors has initiated the process of appointing a new Chief Executive Officer.Appointment of a new permanent representative of CEA Investissement to Soitec’s Board of DirectorsOn October 1  2025  the Board of Directors acknowledged the appointment of Julie Galland as the new permanent representative of CEA Investissement on the Board of Directors and the Strategic Committee of Soitec  in replacement of François Jacq  with immediate effect. Julie Galland has been Director of Technological Research at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) since January 2023.Appointment of a new Director representing the employees to Soitec’s Board of DirectorsOn November 13  2025  Wissème Allali  Director representing the employees on the Board of Directors  resigned from her position for personal reasons. In accordance with applicable legal and statutory provisions  Victor Barruol has been appointed as the new Director representing the employees on the Board of Directors  effective November 14  2025. He will be a member of the Strategic Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The Board of Directors warmly thanks Wissème Allali for her contribution and dedication during her term of office and welcomes Victor Barruol to his new role.Soitec announces a new organizational structureOn October 1  2025  Soitec implemented a new organizational structure to further accelerate the expansion of its product portfolio and strengthen its proximity to customers. Building on the successful diversification achieved through its divisional model  the company will now operate around five clearly defined product lines  enabling faster execution and deeper alignment with customer needs. This evolution reflects a process initiated several months ago under the leadership of Pierre Barnabé and the Executive Committee  aimed at preparing Soitec for its next phase of growth. It does not entail any change in the Group’s financial reporting.Soitec and CEA partner to develop automotive cybersecurity with advanced FD-SOI technologyOn October 20  2025  Soitec and CEA unveiled the results of a study demonstrating how Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (FD-SOI) substrates can deliver intrinsic protection against the threat of fault injection attacks  identified as an increasing risk by automotive cybersecurity ISO/SAE 21434 standard setters. This advantage has been confirmed in research carried out at CEA-Leti laboratories in partnership with Soitec. In tests comparing 22FDX FD-SOI to traditional 28-nanometer bulk silicon  the FD-SOI substrate required up to 150 times more effort and higher laser power to induce a fault  significantly narrowing attack windows and increasing the cost and complexity of intrusion attempts. While traditional bulk silicon substrates remain vulnerable to such attacks  FD-SOI technology offers built-in protection thanks to its buried oxide layer  which isolates the active film from the substrate and eliminates most physical fault mechanisms.# # #H1’26 results will be commented during an analyst and investor conference call to be held on November 20  2025  at 8:00am CET.

EBITDA is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to EBITDA as reported by other groups. It represents additional information and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or net cash generated by operating activities.3 Review procedures were completed  and the review report is in the process of being issued.4 The scope effect is related to the divestment of Dolphin Design’s mixed signal IP activities (completed on October 31  2024) and that of Dolphin Design’s ASIC activities (completed on December 30  2024). This scope effect is strictly related to Edge & Cloud AI.5 Current net profit/(loss) reflects net profit/(loss) (Group share)  excluding significant one-off events during the period that could skew analysis of the Group’s recurring performance. Current basic earnings/(loss) per share corresponds to current net profit/(loss) divided by the weighted average number of shares6 Soitec is aligning FCF calculation with market practices. New FCF definition now includes Capital Expenditures  irrespective of the way they are funded (leasing contracts previously excluded from FCF definition); and both interest income and interest paid. The calculation excludes acquisition of financial assets (nil in the period). In H1’25  reported Free Cash Flow amounted to 35 million Euros (12 million Euros under new definition). In H1’26  Free Cash Flow under previous definition would have been an outflow of 16 million Euros (see table in Appendix)7 Including investments financed through leases of 7 million Euros in H1’26 and 17 million Euros in H1’258 Financial debt less cash and cash equivalentsAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['SECOND QUARTER REVENUE', 'HALF-YEAR RESULTS', 'FISCAL YEAR', 'SOITEC REPORTS', 'advanced Surface Acoustic Wave', 'interim consolidated financial statements3', '1-point negative scope impact', 'other vehicle electrification applications', 'strategic R&D', 'innovative semiconductor materials', 'major fabless companies', 'US flagship smartphones', 'premium Android smartphones', 'next-generation communication architectures', 'smart power management', 'Battery Management Systems', 'initial design wins', 'lower RF-SOI shipments', 'Second quarter FY26', 'customer inventory depletion', 'excess customer inventories', 'SOI end markets', 'new design wins', 'FD-SOI wafer sales', 'SECOND QUARTER REVENUE', 'mixed-signal edge computing', 'Cloud AI division', 'lackluster Automotive market', 'Mobile Communications revenue', 'Q2’26 organic revenue', 'financial discipline', 'new markets', 'new SOI', 'RF-SOI inventories', 'customer needs', 'Dolphin Design', 'inventory correction', 'RF-SOI sales', 'addressable market', 'Market perspectives', 'FD-SOI adoption', 'H1’26 revenue', 'Q3’26 revenue', 'HALF-YEAR RESULTS', 'AI-related products', 'deliberate actions', 'cash generation', 'Net result', 'recurring items', 'current environment', 'Euronext Paris', 'world leader', 'September 30th', 'Pierre Barnabé', 'first half', 'strong momentum', 'specific actions', 'uncertain times', 'H1’26 numbers', 'product portfolio', 'product-centric organization', 'tighter alignment', 'product roadmaps', 'double-digit pace', 'Euro millions', 'exch. rates', 'currency effect', 'short-term softness', 'reference substrate', 'SAW) filters', 'Wi-Fi 7 SoCs', 'low level', 'base effect', 'Power-SOI wafers', 'wireless connectivity', 'Q2’26 sales', 'Q2’26 revenue', 'revenue Q2', 'Q2’25 levels', 'strong performance', 'weaker demand', 'growing demand', 'Automotive weakness', 'different dynamics', 'EBITDA 2 margin', 'future growth', 'innovation front', 'seasonal restocking', 'Industrial revenue', 'Q2’26 performance', 'FISCAL YEAR', 'Soitec revenue', 'SOITEC REPORTS', '217 million Euros', 'POI adoption', '139 million', 'guidance', 'divisions', 'Imager-SOI', 'improvement', 'non', 'expansion', 'Bernin', 'Grenoble', 'France', 'November', 'Board', 'Directors', 'meeting', 'CEO', 'expectations', 'efforts', 'essence', 'Progress', 'diversification', 'readiness', 'company', 'potential', 'change', 'chg', 'const', 'perimeter', 'basis', 'divestment', 'businesses4', 'July', 'foundries', 'Q1', 'Piezoelectric', 'Insulator', 'Asia', '11 customers', 'production', 'qualification', 'positioning', 'activity', 'increase', 'recovery', 'EVs', 'transition', '300mm', 'BMS', 'ADAS', 'technology', 'analog', 'radars', 'microcontrollers', '76']",2025-11-19,2025-11-20,globenewswire.com

Go figure  as they say. Now  yesterday we read from the “legitimate” excerpt of the book that Tsipras released publicly that Merkel was left speechless when he told her he would hold a referendum—but from what I understood  she may have been left speechless  but nothing really happened to her  since her term was… peculiarly full. She was constantly wrapped up in dealings with Putin and was fooling all of Europe with the prices of Russian gas—would she balk at Alexis? In any case  I repeat (stereotypically)  I don’t understand what purpose it really serves Tsipras to remind everyone of those dramatic moments in History. And between us  I’m told that everyone at the Maximos Mansion wonders why he did it  “when he could have written a book about the future with at least some references to the past  but in any case not something like this.” Anyway  I’ll close the Tsipras-related matters with a clarification about what I wrote yesterday about his self-criticism in the book on “family issues” (I’m getting there little by little…). I didn’t mean that the man is apologizing to his own family environment  but that he is doing some self-criticism regarding what was said  written  and done against the family of his political opponent.The big game of ElefsinaNow to government matters: Guilfoyle continues unabated with moves that strengthen American interests  which nevertheless also help us. Last week she “set her sights” on the port of Piraeus  and yesterday she visited Theodorikakos  promoting the idea of an alternative hub centered around ONEX’s investment in the Elefsina shipyards. Practically speaking  the relevant amendment will soon be submitted by the minister so it can be voted on in November  allowing the company to utilize a shipyard area for other purposes—essentially to create a logistics hub connected by rail and road to Thriasio. In other words  it seems that Elefsina is being positioned as an alternative hub mainly for the transport of energy and other goods. With all this  I think it will be interesting to see the reaction of Chinese officials who will be in Athens on Thursday for the anniversary event of the Hellenic-Chinese Chamber.The role of the DFCA critical parameter in the ONEX deal is the role of the DFC  the US public investment fund. In fact  the first company ever funded by the DFC was ONEX  while the American fund also joined the Aktor–DEPA deal. There is also a push for its involvement in the GSI—the Greece–Cyprus electrical interconnection cable.The livestock breeders’ package“Reading the room” and the anger of livestock breeders afflicted by sheep pox  K.M. announced yesterday an immediate support package that will be given shortly and will likely be announced next week by Chatzidakis–Tsiaras (who were in Brussels yesterday for consultations). The package will certainly exceed €50 million and will be granted by the end of the year  but the final amount will be “locked in” after discussions with Deputy Finance Minister Thanos Petralias. The logic is that the more animals—and therefore income—you lost  the greater the amount of direct support.From tsipouro to tsikoudiaMeanwhile  in ND they eat  drink  and mingle. After the “tsipouro cauldron” that Florina MP Stavros Papasotiriou organized over the weekend  gathering around thirty MPs and ministers  next up is Avgenakis in Heraklion on the weekend of November 29–30. The former minister traditionally holds “cauldron gatherings ” but with tsikoudia and ‘antikristo’ roast  while for Saturday morning a football match has also been organized between MPs and journalists  together with veteran players from OFI and Ergotelis  with proceeds going to Heraklion charities.The end of a relationshipIn PASOK matters  the distance between the mayor of Athens and the East Attica MP Manolis Christodoulakis is fully confirmed. Doukas does not rule out even Tsipras’s party from the next-day dialogue  contrary to Christodoulakis who insists on an autonomous course. A few days ago  Doukas “warded off” a mechanisms-driven congress  saying “we’re tired of the line-followers.” And Christodoulakis also says “we didn’t just meet yesterday.” Long story short  ahead of the congress Christodoulakis will gauge his strength across the party machinery  keeping contacts across the country as a former party secretary  while a core group is supporting him for a future autonomous candidacy whenever required.The unexpectedly big success of Euronext (and the market)We had several surprises in the market. No one expected that its public offer for the Hellenic Exchanges (EXAE) would be such a success. Not even Euronext itself expected it—hence it lowered the bar from 67% to 50% + 1 share. Today the official announcements will be made regarding the 73% acceptance that the public offer gathered. No one also expected that with an economy upgrade  a flood of positive reports  and Euronext’s success  the stock market would take such a beating. What can you do? Partly the time of year is not suitable for purchases by professionals  partly it’s global markets  and there is also a trend of foreign institutional investors selling bank stocks—it doesn’t take much.€500 000 bonus for Yiannos KontopoulosStill  if you are worried about EXAE’s management after Euronext’s success  this column reassures you  as—according to information—the Board of EXAE approved the payment of a €500 000 bonus to CEO Yiannos Kontopoulos  who despite the change in ownership will continue performing his duties at least until June 2026  when his contract expires.New voluntary-exit program at National BankOnce this used to be big news. Now it’s routine. Information says that National Bank is preparing a new voluntary-exit program for its staff. The most interesting thing about these programs now is how far the age limit has dropped  because today there are practically no employees over 50 years old left in branches.PPC hits its coverage target (1.5 million households) for optical fiberMore than 1.4 million households and businesses had been covered by the end of last September  compared to 477 000 in September 2023 (+200%) and 650 000 at the end of 2024 (+120%). PPC has now effectively met—and will exceed—its target of covering 1.5 million households and businesses by the end of 2025. Coverage is progressing excellently; the unknown variable remains how many fiber-optic subscribers PPC actually has. Meanwhile  the company is expanding its service range  and since last June has launched its internet-only FTTH service  available to 600 000 households and businesses and expanding into new areas  with more FTTH-based services planned soon. Financially  PPC is on track to reach its adjusted EBITDA target of €2 billion  as 9-month adjusted EBITDA reached €1.7 billion (+24%)  while today management presents the new three-year business plan (2026–2028) in London.Defense: the big opportunity for Greek industryThe Defense Budget is bringing a revolution for Greek industry. Greece has allocated €6.1 billion for this year (last year it was €3.6 billion) and has already announced a 12-year strategic program worth €25 billion. Obviously  major suppliers come from abroad. The General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments (GDAEE) has set as a condition for approving a supplier that each proposal must include at least “25% Greek Added Value”—i.e.  participation of Greek industries. If this is not possible for a specific procurement (e.g.  ultra-modern aircraft)  then the supplier must ensure the 25% Greek Added Value in another country. In addition  foreign suppliers  in order to secure this 25%  assign support  maintenance  or repair work to Greek companies. At the same time  NATO has reopened its NATO Supply Chain Certification list  and Greek manufacturing and industrial companies are scrambling to get into the approved-suppliers list. EU defense spending reached a record €343 billion in 2024 (+19% vs 2023)  and for 2025 programs worth €381 billion (2.1% of EU GDP) have been announced. Right now  Greek production units—from screws to software to packaging—are fighting hard to turn this painful “necessity” of defense spending into an “opportunity” for industrial rejuvenation.Koustas locks in shipyard slots until 2028Danaos Corp announced an order of six new feeder container ships  along with charters bringing $236 million in revenue  raising total backlog to $4.1 billion. Now 21 of its vessels are tied to charter contracts averaging 5.8 years. Small details? Not for Koustas  who seems to be “locking in” shipyard slots for 2028  while newbuilding prices are rising. Essentially  the strategy is twofold: on the one hand  he capitalizes on “below-market” prices for mid-size feeders; on the other  he strengthens the fleet with capesize bulkers—such as the purchase of Hebei No 1—expanding exposure to larger cargoes. This way  Danaos maintains strong cash flow while securing future revenues for the next 6–10 years. Looking at the numbers  earnings before taxes and interest are positive ($131 million)  while adjusted earnings per share ($6.75) came in slightly below Wall Street expectations ($7.10). But the key takeaway isn’t the quarterly numbers—it’s the long-term positioning: Koustas is “getting ahead” of the markets in container ships and bulkers before prices skyrocket and shipyard slots run out. Simply put  Koustas’s move resembles a Wall-Street-style hedge: he secures revenue through charters  expands the fleet with “cheap” new orders  and simultaneously invests in larger vessels ahead of the next wave of freight-rate increases.The Koumandaros ordersThe Koumandaros family  through Atlantic Bulk Carriers  shows once again that Greek shipowners fear neither geopolitical risks nor regulatory changes when it comes to renewing and expanding their fleets. The recent order of four ultramax vessels at the Nantong Xiangyu shipyards  just a few months after receiving three previous ships  sends a clear message: the Greeks know the game. Brokers estimate the value of the deal at $135 million  roughly $33.8 million per ship  with delivery scheduled for 2028. From a market perspective  the strategy resembles a hedge: the company is already liquidating older ships (three in the last two years for $31 million)  likely to make room for the new units. At the same time  the favorable conditions in the secondhand supramax market allow for profits from selling older vessels such as the Desert Victory and Desert Glory (2011). Reflecting the trend  ultramax and supramax shipbuilding orders worldwide are declining (11.2% of the respective tonnage under construction  down from 14.5% in July 2024). This pushes prices downward while keeping demand for secondhand ships high—a combination Greek owners seem to fully exploit. Overall  the move reflects classic Greek realist strategy: buy at a low price  sell older units  and at the same time maintain a strong presence in mid-size bulkers—despite global market clouds and geopolitical risk scenarios.Boxships cash and tankers plan of the Greeks on NasdaqEuroholdings is leveraging its existing vessels  which are performing well  while simultaneously shifting toward new markets. The company’s older containerships  two of them over ten years old  continue to generate profits  with an average daily charter of $16 580 in the third quarter  up from $14 087 last year—even after the sale of the third vessel initially planned for the spin-off. The result? Although total revenues fell by 29.4% to $3 million due to the smaller fleet  net profits rose by one third to $1.5 million  and the company announced a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter. At the same time  Euroholdings is beginning to implement its “plan B”: a shift toward tankers  starting with a medium-range product tanker. The first move was the purchase of the 10-year-old MR2 Hellas Avatar  expected to be delivered in November. This strategy is supported by Marla Investments of Marianna Latsi’s family  which acquired 51% of the company  while the family of Aristeidis Pittas maintains a significant stake. The strategy resembles Wall Street-style “risk balancing”: cash from existing assets to finance entry into a new  more promising market.Cenergy  steel pipes and offshore drillingThe Financial Times published an interesting article on the revival of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and globally. The article discusses new ultra-high-pressure technology used in projects such as Chevron’s Anchor  which opens up new markets that were previously unreachable. Chevron is already carrying out a major contract in the Gulf of Mexico  in a region where oil production is expected to increase by 6% this year and 3% in 2026. What’s of Greek interest in this development is that very few companies worldwide can produce pipes for extreme depths. Cenergy is one of them. Cenergy’s steel pipes division has recorded a record operating profit this year (EBITDA €100 million). Since conventional oil production is shrinking and offshore extraction is becoming essential  analysts see significant growth potential in these specialized steel pipes. The article concludes by noting that the Trump administration  with its “drill baby drill” policy  is “opening” new areas for exploitation (California  Alaska)  while Wood Mackenzie estimates that the new technology will unlock 2 billion barrels of oil in the Gulf. A new market  with few barriers and high specialization  for Cenergy.Entrenched at the 2 000-point fortressIt was bound to happen sooner or later. Markets correct  optimists investing with leverage must pay the price  and pessimists are vindicated—at least temporarily. When everyone around you is selling shares  you have to lock in your profits. When Alpha Bank’s stock has returned +115% since the beginning of the year and its market cap exceeds €8 billion  it’s logical for shares worth €62.7 million to change hands and for the share price to remain at €3.52 (–1.4%). Yesterday’s battle on the Stock Exchange was fought around the 2 000-point fortress. That’s where the battle will take place again today  since yesterday the General Index closed at the session’s lowest point  at 2 012.51 points (–2.09%). That’s also why trading volume had nothing to do with the previous day’s dull session  reaching €250.95 million  with €54.6 million in block trades. From the morning  market signals were not favorable—neither from Asia nor from Europe. And at midday  when American investors woke up  the absence of buyers frightened anyone holding leveraged positions  prompting them to liquidate. It wasn’t a sophisticated strategy—they sold the stocks that had performed the best in recent days. In banks  aside from the impressive trading volume in Alpha  Piraeus (–4.26% at €6.66)  Eurobank (–3.54% at €3.32)  and National Bank (–3.74% at €12.61) all fell victim to their strong performance this year. The same happened to the stocks of the Viohalco Group. ELVALHALCOR sank –6.96% to €3.21  Cenergy fell –3.32% to €15.14  while parent Viohalco limited losses to –1.79%  closing at €9.90. The market blatantly ignored the very strong earnings announced by PPC (–1.3% at €16.7) and the commitment to €2 billion in operating profitability. Intralot  with €13.6 million in trading value  fought hard against short-selling pressure—at one point losing more than 4%—but eventually limited losses to –0.19% at €1.07.ECB: The calm warning before the stormThe European Central Bank sent a message yesterday that should not be underestimated: “Prepare for unprecedented shocks.” The ECB announced its supervisory priorities for 2025–2027  which include the following exact wording: “Geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies  climate- and nature-related crises  demographic change  and technological disruption exacerbate structural vulnerabilities  making the likelihood of extreme low-probability events unprecedentedly high.” In simple terms  Frankfurt is asking banks to hold higher liquidity buffers  upgrade their information systems  and remain alert. And all this at a time when banks are extremely strong. The ECB calls for “forward-looking management that stays in touch with financial realities and more penetrating supervision.”Nvidia’s momentWho would have expected that markets would literally hang on Nvidia’s third-quarter results being released today? The tech giant  with its $4.4 trillion market cap  has become the leader of the global AI market  meaning anything it announces translates instantly into multibillion-dollar moves—especially now that Wall Street is riding the AI wave. Nvidia has driven the rise of the U.S. market and represents a huge share of this year’s index gains  with its weighting in the S&P 500 around 8%. Sales of Nvidia’s chips (H100  new GPU generations) are the best indicator of the sustainability of the Wall Street rally—and by extension global markets. If the company reports strong demand  it will show that Big Tech continues pouring billions into AI. If not  the market will fear the cycle is slowing  and the tremors will be strong. Already  the balance is highly delicate as high-profile investors like billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund and SoftBank have sold shares  adding pressure to the stock.When the “safe haven” is shakenThe world’s third-largest bond market  Japan’s  is not standing on solid ground. Yields on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) have surged to their highest levels since the 2008 Financial Crisis  while 30- and 40-year JGBs are approaching historic highs. For many decades  Japanese bonds were synonymous with absolute safety. The Bank of Japan was buying bonds en masse through its quantitative easing program  keeping yields near zero. Now the balance is shifting. There are two main reasons: First  Japan’s worsening fiscal situation. With public debt exceeding 260% of GDP—the highest in the developed world—investors are beginning to question its sustainability. Japan has traditionally relied on domestic savings to finance its debt  but the aging population is changing this equation. Second  external demand for JGBs is weakening. Foreign investors  who traditionally bought Japanese bonds as a hedge  are now seeking higher yields elsewhere—especially since Japan abandoned its negative interest rate policy. If this trend continues  Japan will face an explosive increase in borrowing costs. With an annual deficit that requires continuous refinancing  every percentage point rise in yields translates into billions of additional spending. And if the world’s third-largest economy loses access to cheap financing  the consequences will be felt by everyone.,negative,0.01,0.31,0.68,mixed,0.23,0.24,0.53,True,English,"['golden half-million bonus', 'speechless Angela', 'repentant) Tsipras', 'Elefsina deal', 'blue party', 'tsipouro', 'tsikoudia', 'Greece–Cyprus electrical interconnection cable', 'Deputy Finance Minister Thanos Petralias', 'East Attica MP Manolis Christodoulakis', 'Florina MP Stavros Papasotiriou', 'US public investment fund', 'Aktor–DEPA deal', 'immediate support package', 'former party secretary', 'future autonomous candidacy', 'livestock breeders’ package', 'Manolis Petsitis', 'former minister', 'American fund', 'public offer', 'direct support', 'autonomous course', 'epic line', 'Maximos Mansion', 'beautiful day', 'night-owl” Lalas', 'legitimate” excerpt', 'Russian gas', 'dramatic moments', 'Tsipras-related matters', 'political opponent', 'big game', 'government matters', 'American interests', 'alternative hub', 'relevant amendment', 'shipyard area', 'other purposes', 'logistics hub', 'other words', 'other goods', 'Chinese officials', 'anniversary event', 'Hellenic-Chinese Chamber', 'critical parameter', 'sheep pox', 'K.M.', 'Chatzidakis–Tsiaras', 'cauldron gatherings', 'antikristo’ roast', 'Saturday morning', 'football match', 'veteran players', 'PASOK matters', 'next-day dialogue', 'party machinery', 'core group', 'several surprises', 'Hellenic Exchanges', 'ONEX deal', 'family issues', 'family environment', 'Nikos Pappas', 'first company', 'final amount', 'tsipouro cauldron', 'thirty MPs', 'Heraklion charities', 'mechanisms-driven congress', 'big success', 'Elefsina shipyards', 'Newsroom', 'referendum', 'Tonight', 'giant', 'politics', 'dealings', 'killers', 'figure', 'book', 'Merkel', 'term', 'Putin', 'Europe', 'prices', 'Alexis', 'case', 'everyone', 'History', 'references', 'past', 'something', 'clarification', 'self-criticism', 'Guilfoyle', 'moves', 'sights', 'Piraeus', 'Theodorikakos', 'idea', 'November', 'rail', 'road', 'Thriasio', 'transport', 'energy', 'reaction', 'Athens', 'Thursday', 'role', 'DFC', 'fact', 'push', 'involvement', 'GSI', 'anger', 'Brussels', 'consultations', 'year', 'discussions', 'logic', 'animals', 'income', 'tsikoudia', 'weekend', 'ministers', 'Avgenakis', 'journalists', 'OFI', 'Ergotelis', 'proceeds', 'relationship', 'distance', 'mayor', 'Doukas', 'line-followers', 'strength', 'contacts', 'country', 'Euronext', 'market', 'EXAE', 'bar', '1 share']",2025-11-19,2025-11-20,en.protothema.gr
