Last week  the Western-backed National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) announced a probe into a “high-level criminal organization” allegedly led by Timur Mindich  a former business associate of Vladimir Zelensky. The criminal ring allegedly siphoned around $100 million in kickbacks from state-owned nuclear operator Energoatom.Scraping together more money for Ukraine is aimed only at prolonging the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine  Orban wrote on X.”Let’s choose common sense. Let’s stop funding a war that cannot be won  alongside the corrupt Ukrainian war mafia  and focus our strength on establishing peace ” the prime minister said.Brussels is seeking to “scrape” together €135 billion ($156 billion) to prop up Kiev  but it doesn’t have the money  Orban wrote. The bloc’s leadership has three proposals on the table regarding how to get it  and all of them lead to the same “Brusselian dead end ” he argued.The first proposal involves member states chipping in “willingly and cheerfully  from their own budgets ” and the second is Brussels’ favorite “magic trick” – joint borrowing  Orban said. “There’s no money for the war today  so our grandchildren will pay the bill. Absurd.”The last option is seizing frozen Russian assets  which could be regarded as a “convenient solution ” but involves unpredictable risks for the entire eurozone  he warned.Russia has warned that it considers attempts to tamper with its frozen assets as “theft ” threatening retaliation. A potential “sort-of-confiscation” is strongly opposed by Belgium  home to the Euroclear clearinghouse which holds the majority of the frozen assets. The country has argued that it would be exposed to immense legal and financial risks and has demanded that fellow EU members share them.,negative,0.01,0.3,0.7,negative,0.02,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['corrupt Ukrainian war mafia', 'EU', 'funding', 'Orban', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Western-backed National Anti-Corruption Bureau', 'same “Brusselian dead end', 'Brussels’ favorite “magic trick', 'corrupt Ukrainian war mafia', 'corrupt war mafia', 'massive graft scandal', 'former business associate', 'state-owned nuclear operator', 'high-level criminal organization', 'fellow EU members', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Hungarian PM', 'criminal ring', 'frozen assets', 'common sense', 'Timur Mindich', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'three proposals', 'first proposal', 'member states', 'joint borrowing', 'last option', 'convenient solution', 'unpredictable risks', 'entire eurozone', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'immense legal', 'financial risks', 'Ukraine conflict', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'efforts', 'peace', 'remarks', 'Tuesday', 'NABU', 'probe', 'kickbacks', 'Energoatom', 'money', 'hostilities', 'strength', 'leadership', 'budgets', 'grandchildren', 'bill', 'attempts', 'retaliation', 'confiscation', 'Belgium', 'majority', 'country']",2025-11-20,2025-11-21,rt.com

Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $346 billion. Around $230 billion are held in European accounts  predominantly at Belgium's Euroclear. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned the freezing of its central bank's assets in Europe as theft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow could respond by seizing assets held in Russia by Western countries.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251024/belgian-minister-warns-confiscating-russian-assets-would-trigger-a-very-painful-response-1123011544.htmlrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleuropean union  russia  ukraine,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,negative,0.0,0.18,0.81,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Orban', 'EU', 'Lawsuits', 'Collapse', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'viktor orban european union', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'European Commission', 'European accounts', 'military operation', 'central bank', 'Western countries', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'Sputnik International', 'sputnikglobe', 'russias-frozen-assets', 'lawsuits', 'Collapse', 'MOSCOW', 'Ukraine', 'benefit', 'Thursday', 'world', 'cdn', 'money', 'ways', 'start', 'G7', 'half', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'freezing', 'theft', 'belgian-minister-warns', 'confiscating-russian-assets', 'painful-response', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-11-20,2025-11-21,sputnikglobe.com

With the United States scaling back military and financial support  the EU has pledged to step up and fill the void.Von der Leyen notes that ""without sustained and scaled-up support in 2026 and beyond  Ukraine seriously risks economic impasse  undermining its capacity to defend itself and maintain essential state functions.""The paper estimates that Ukraine is in need of 71.7 billion euros next year  out of which 51.6 billion would be in the form of military assistance  and 20.1 billion in macro-financial assistance such as budget support.For 2027  military support is estimated at 31.8 billion euros  while 32.2 billion euros would go to macro-financial assistance  assuming the war ends next year.The first option would entail individual EU member states providing voluntary bilateral contributions such as grants to the union  based on their gross national income (GNI) with the European Commission then transferring that as nonrepayable financial aid to Kyiv.The paper notes that while this wouldn't create new joint liabilities as the reparations loan would  it would impact the national budgets of member states  especially at a time when many countries are faced with little or no economic growth and populations that are increasingly weary of supporting Ukraine financially from their own pockets.The very fact that it is a voluntary scheme also makes it difficult to raise all the necessary cash quickly.Using The European Stability MechanismAlternatively  the paper also suggests that the EU can use the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)  a vehicle created during the eurozone crisis  to provide financial assistance to struggling euro-area member countries.This would  however  require a change of the ESM-treaty to expand the scope to Ukraine  create legal liabilities and interest costs for eurozone countries  along with a need to figure out a way of how non-Eurozone EU countries could contribute.The second option is that the EU would provide a loan to Ukraine by borrowing on the financial markets  using the bloc's triple-A rating. This means that Brussels would require Ukraine to repay the loan  but just as with the reparations loan  this would only happen once Kyiv receives war-damage compensation from Russia.The text notes that such a loan would require EU member states ""to provide legally binding  unconditional  irrevocable and on-demand guarantees  distributed amongst member states according to the GNI key to cover the situation where the borrowing needs to be repaid to investors in the absence of repayment by Ukraine.""Member states would also need to pay interest rates  and with the scheme also being voluntary  more burden would have to be put on participating ones if one or several countries decided to opt out.One alternative would be that the EU borrowing could be backed by the common EU budget. But current EU rules don't allow the budget to be used in this way for non-EU countries. And a change of rules requires unanimity  which will be hard to achieve given both Hungary's and Slovakia's reluctance to continue spending money on Kyiv.Utilizing Frozen Russian State AssetsThat leaves Brussels with the reparations loan  which most EU member states see as the fairest option as it doesn't require EU borrowing from markets nor direct national contributions. But it is not without perils -- as Belgium has pointed out.While not directly confiscating the Russian assets  they will be replaced with bonds issued by the European Commission and backed by EU member states. This would mean ""a compulsory tailor-made debt contract with central securities depositories"" such as the Belgium-based Euroclear in which EU member states provide ""legally binding  unconditional  irrevocable  and on demand guarantees to the union  based on the GNI-key.""Belgium is fretting that it might have to repay the money by itself if Russia takes it to court and wins. The European Commission is therefore keen not only to make sure that this undertaking is completely legally sound but also to ensure legal liabilities are spread among member states and not just expose Belgium.This is  however  not the only worry. The paper does also point out that other third countries might reconsider investing in the euro area as they don't consider it safe.""As this option would be a financially and legally innovative solution  it cannot be discounted that there are potential knock-on effects  including for financial markets "" it says.""Although the design of this option will ensure full compliance with international law under all scenarios  there is a risk of such knock-on effects if the Reparations Loan is incorrectly perceived by others as a confiscation.""Full ComplianceWhile no remedy is offered on how this can be mitigated  the document stresses that other international partners such as Britain  Japan  or the United States could follow suit to reduce the perception that Russian sovereign assets simply are appropriated.Another issue that the European Commission also hasn't addressed is that the sanctions which make the Russian assets immobilized must be renewed by unanimity twice a year.While this has happened ever since the restrictive measures were imposed over three years ago  there is no guarantee that this unanimity will last  notably as some EU capitals have questioned the usefulness of sanctions and Hungary previously having toyed with the idea of not giving a green light to a rollover.Russia could reclaim the assets in such a scenario  leaving EU member states to foot the bill.Source: https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-options-ukraine-financing- russia-war/33594928.htmlCopyright (c) 2025.

Combined with the substantial reduction in operating cash burn and proceeds from our ATM transactions  we have further enhanced Valneva’s financial flexibility as we approach the potentially transformative Phase 3 data readout for our Lyme disease vaccine candidate.”Commercial PortfolioValneva’s commercial portfolio is composed of three travel vaccines  IXIARO®/JESPECT®  DUKORAL® and recently launched IXCHIQ®. The Company also distributes certain third-party products in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure.Valneva’s sales in the first nine months of 2025 were €119.4 million compared to €112.5 million in the first nine months of 2024. The first nine months of 2025 included €16.1 million of third-party sales compared to €22.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 due to the discontinuation of the distribution of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur® in the UK and Canada as of January 2025. Valneva expects that third-party sales will gradually wind down to less than 5% of its total sales by 2026/2027  allowing the Company to improve gross margins.In June 2025  Valneva announced an exclusive agreement with CSL Seqirus  one of the world’s largest influenza vaccine companies  for the marketing and distribution of Valneva’s three proprietary vaccines in Germany. Under the agreed terms  CSL Seqirus has launched Valneva’s single-dose chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® and will begin commercializing Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO® and cholera/ETEC vaccine DUKORAL® from January 2026.JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE IXIARO®/JESPECT®In the first nine months of 2025  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales increased by 12.5% to €74.3 million compared to €66.0 million in the first nine months of 2024. Sales to both travelers and the U.S. military showed double digit growth compared to the first nine months of 2024  when sales were impacted by IXIARO® supply constraints. Foreign currency fluctuations of €0.8 million adversely impacted sales of IXIARO®/JESPECT® during the first nine months of 2025.CHOLERA / ETEC4-DIARRHEA VACCINE DUKORAL®In the first nine months of 2025  DUKORAL® sales were €21.5 million compared to €22.3 million in the first nine months of 2024. Sales were notably affected by €0.4 million of adverse currency fluctuations mainly resulting from a weakening Canadian dollar and lower sales in Germany as the distribution of the vaccine is gradually transitioning from the current distributor to CSL Seqirus.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE IXCHIQ®In the first nine months of 2025  Valneva reported IXCHIQ® sales of €7.6 million compared to sales of €1.8 million in the first nine months of 2024. While IXCHIQ® sales included the supply of vaccine doses to combat a major chikungunya outbreak on the French island of La Réunion  the temporary restrictions and U.S. license suspension5 significantly impacted sales in the travelers’ segment  leading to an adjustment of guidance.Valneva responded to the FDA and is awaiting further information from the U.S. regulatory agency. The Company is meanwhile focused on increasing sales in other territories  including Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Valneva recently reported positive long-term antibody persistence data four years after vaccination with a single dose of IXCHIQ®  showing a 95% seroresponse that was comparable in older (65+) and younger adults6. This differentiating feature provides a competitive advantage for both repeat travelers and in endemic areas.Clinical Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 VALOR study on trackValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a vaccine candidate targeting Borrelia  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Pfizer is currently executing the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 field efficacy study  VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists).Vaccinations have been completed and Valneva expects VALOR trial outcomes to be announced in the first half of 2026  followed by regulatory submissions as planned. Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to EMA in 2026  subject to positive Phase 3 data.SHIGELLA VACCINE CANDIDATE – S4V2Two Phase 2 trials ongoingS4V2 is the world’s most clinically advanced tetravalent vaccine candidate against shigellosis  the second leading cause of fatal diarrhea worldwide. Two clinical studies of S4V2  a Phase 2 infant safety and immunogenicity study7  and a Phase 2b Human Challenge Study (CHIM)8  sponsored by LimmaTech Biologics AG  are ongoing. Subject to positive results for both studies  Valneva will assume responsibility for all further development9.No approved multivalent Shigella vaccine is currently available outside of Russia or China  and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)10. In October 2024  the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to S4V2  recognizing its potential to address a serious condition and fill an unmet medical need11. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually12.ZIKA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1601Positive Phase 1 resultsValneva recently announced positive safety and immunogenicity results for the Phase 1 clinical trial of VLA1601  its second-generation adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus (ZIKV)13. Data up to Day 57 (four weeks after the second dose) showed that VLA1601 was generally safe  well tolerated and immunogenic across all five treatment arms investigated.Despite the medical need  regulatory pathways and market opportunities for potential Zika vaccines remain uncertain. Valneva will therefore only consider further potential development steps for VLA1601 if concrete private and public funding opportunities materialize.Nine Months 2025 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €127.0 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €116.6 million in the first nine months of 2024.Valneva’s total product sales reached €119.4 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €112.5 million in the same period of 2024. The 6.2% sales growth was mainly driven by IXIARO®/JESPECT® and IXCHIQ® while the planned discontinuation of certain third-party product distribution and foreign currency fluctuations of €1.3 million adversely impacted sales during the first nine months of 2025.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services increased to €7.6 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €4.2 million in the same period of 2024. The increase mainly resulted from revenues recognized under the exclusive license agreement with the Serum Institute of India for Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €71.1 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €71.3 million in the same period of 2024. The gross margin on commercial product sales  excluding IXCHIQ®  amounted to 57.2% compared to 48.6% in the first nine months of 2024. The improvement in the gross margin was driven primarily by better manufacturing performance and improvements in the overall product sales mix.COGS of €27.3 million related to IXIARO® sales  €10.3 million related to DUKORAL® sales  €10.2 million to the third-party products distribution business and €8.6 million to IXCHIQ®. Additional €8.2 million COGS resulted from idle capacity and other costs not allocated to products and €6.3 million from cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €59.7 million in the first nine months of 2025  compared to €48.6 million in the first nine months of 2024. This increase was mainly driven by higher costs related to the Shigella vaccine candidate following the R&D collaboration agreement with LimmaTech Biologics AG and costs related to Phase 4 post-marketing commitments for IXCHIQ®.Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €28.6 million compared to €35.7 million in the first nine months of 2024. The decrease was mainly related to a reduction in advertising  promotional and consultancy spending  following the launch of IXCHIQ®.In the first nine months of 2025  general and administrative expenses reduced to €29.5 million from €32.6 million in the same period of 2024. The reductions were primarily related to lower recruitment spending and insurance charges as well as savings in advisory and professional services.During the first nine months of 2024  a net gain of €90.8 million from the sale of the PRV was recorded and did not recur in 2025.Other income  net of other expenses  decreased to €8.0 million in the first nine months of 2025 from €14.9 million in the first nine months of 2024. The reduction was mainly related to lower grant income from Scottish Enterprise and lower eligible R&D spend resulting in reduced R&D tax credits in Austria in the first nine months of 2025.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €53.9 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to an operating profit of €34.2 million in the comparative period of 2024. The decrease was mainly the result of the PRV sale in 2024  partly offset by higher gross profit and reduced SG&A spending in the first nine months of 2025.Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss was €37.7 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to an adjusted EBITDA profit of €48.6 million in the comparative period of 2024  which benefited from the PRV sale.Net ResultIn the first nine months of 2025  Valneva generated a net loss of €65.2 million. This compared to a net profit of €24.7 million in the first nine months of 2024  mainly resulting from the sale of the PRV in February 2024.Finance expense and currency effects in the first nine months of 2025 resulted in a net finance expense of €9.1 million  compared to a net finance expense of €13.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. This is mainly related to the development of USD exchange rate versus EUR  which generated a foreign currency profit of €6.3 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €3.0 million in the first nine months of 2024.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €28.4 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to €76.7 million in the same period of 2024. The significant reduction in cash used in operating activities compared to last year is driven by the increase in sales and efficient cost management.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €1.4 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to cash inflows of €72.2 million in the first nine months of 2024. Cash inflows in the first nine months of 2024 resulted from €90.8 million net proceeds from the sale of the PRV.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €8.7 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to a net cash inflow of €35.3 million in the first nine months of 2024. Cash inflows in the first nine months of 2025 included €26.2 million net proceeds from three ATM transactions. Cash inflows for the comparator period of 2024 included €57.5 million from a private placement.Cash and cash equivalents were €143.5 million as at September 30  2025  compared to €168.3 million at December 31  2024.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net profit / (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange (gain)/loss  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA net profit / (loss)  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Nine months ended September 30  (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2025 2024 Net profit / (loss) (65.2) 24.7 Add: Income tax (benefits)/expense 2.1 (3.9) Total finance income (1.9) (1.3) Total finance expense 17.3 17.7 Foreign currency (gain)/loss – net (6.3) (3.0) Amortization 3.6 3.7 Depreciation 12.6 10.7 Impairment 0.0 0.0 Adjusted EBITDA (37.7) 48.6About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

This is based on current assumptions and programs and does not include exceptional events. This estimation assumes (i) our expectation to receive significant future commercial milestone revenue pursuant to the license agreement with Ipsen and Ipsen meeting its sales-based thresholds and (ii) drawing down all additional installments under the Royalty Financing agreement with HCRx.In the first nine months of 2025  cash utilization is mainly the result of our research and development efforts in our pipeline focused on ACLF (notably VS-01  G1090N2  SRT-015  CLM-022  and VS-02 HE)  as well as GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Cash utilization was notably offset by a €26.5 million milestone payment received in July 2025 under the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen  following pricing and reimbursement approvals for Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European markets3.RevenueRevenue4 for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €39.2 million compared to €59.7 million for the same period in 2024.Revenue for the first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by the Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Ipsen  including (i) royalty revenue from worldwide sales (excluding Greater China) of Ipsen's Iqirvo® (elafibranor) totaling €12.6 million and (ii) milestone revenue from pricing and reimbursement approval of Iqirvo® (elafibranor) in three major European countries3 totaling €26.5 million.Program highlightsACLF pipelineG1090N2 – A Phase 1 First-in-Human study in healthy volunteers is currently underway with safety data expected at the end of this year. Early signals of efficacy from ex-vivo functional assays are also expected at the same time.SRT-015 – Current work on an improved formulation aims at increasing exposure. Pending positive development  the launch of a first-in-human trial could be initiated as early as the second half of 2026.CLM-022 – Current experiments aim at confirming therapeutic efficacy using different disease models relevant for AD and ACLF as well as starting formulation development and first toxicological studies in 2025. Pending further positive developments  a first-in-human trial could be initiated in the first half of 2027.VS-02-HE – We intend to develop VS-02-HE as a unique oral formulation designed to act in the gut where ammonia is primarily produced  minimizing systemic absorption of ammonia while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. Completion of Investigational New Drug-enabling nonclinical studies and formulation development are expected by the end of 2025. A first-in-human trial could be initiated in the second half of 2027.Other life-threatening diseasesGNS561 in CCA – Data readout from the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial are expected by the end of 2025.VS-01-HAC in Urea Cycle Disorders & Organic Acidemias (pediatric indication) – Data from the pivotal juvenile toxicology study in Göttingen Minipigs are expected before the end of 2025. Following discontinuation of VS-01 in ACLF  additional preclinical work will be conducted before moving into the clinic. Update on the ongoing preclinical work and potential clinical development is expected before the end of 2025.Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)As reported in Ipsen’s third quarter financial results5  Iqirvo® (elafibranor) continues to show solid growth across both the U.S. and European markets in PBC.ENDABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

Accor Stadium once again brought communities together through unmissable spectacles  from global concert tours to marquee national sporting events  driving exceptional demand and cementing Sydney’s position as one of the world’s great events capitals.From the electrifying NRL and NRLW Grand Finals to record-breaking concerts by global superstars  Accor Stadium continues to deliver world-class experiences that fill hotels  restaurants and precincts across the city.The NRL Grand Final in October attracted a sell-out crowd of 80 000+ fans  with Accor hotels in Sydney Centre recording occupancy above 98% on both Saturday and Sunday night – a strong uplift on the previous year. Similarly  the 2025 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia  which included a blockbuster match at Accor Stadium  generated a surge in interstate and international stays  reinforcing the vital role major events play in driving visitor demand.Looking ahead  headline international acts such as Ed Sheeran are already locked in  with his The Loop Tour returning to Accor Stadium for three sold-out shows on 13  14 and 15 February 2026. The city’s appetite for live entertainment shows no sign of slowing.These high-profile events demonstrate Sydney’s ability to activate tourism at scale - filling hotels  energising local businesses  and creating lasting economic benefit across the visitor economy. With so many major events booked and delivered  Sydney is perfectly positioned to capture the next wave of global travellers. Adrian WilliamsTourism outlook: Travel demand accelerates into 2026Across Australia  hotel performance continues to build momentum compared with last year  particularly in key cities such as Sydney  Melbourne  Brisbane and Perth. This growth has been fuelled by a rise in leisure travel and MICE (meetings  incentives  conferences and events) groups  which are both outperforming 2024 levels.Leisure travel remains especially strong  with travellers seeking experiences beyond the traditional hotel stay. Accor’s booking pace across Australia has averaged 16% higher year-on-year since the start of 2025  while STR market demand is up 3.6%.Inbound tourism continues to rebound strongly  with international stays in Accor’s Australian hotels up 9% year-on-year  driven by growth from China  the United Kingdom and Singapore.Sydney has mirrored this national upswing  with year-to-date STR market demand for Sydney and its surrounds up 5.2% on last year. The city continues to benefit from surging leisure travel and strong meeting and event group activity  with Accor recording an average booking pace increase of 6% since January.International visitation into Accor’s Sydney hotels is up 13% year-on-year  supported by growth from China  the Republic of Korea and Indonesia  and further reinforcing Sydney’s position as one of the most desirable global destinations.From luxury to economy  Accor operates more than 400 hotels in the Pacific region under renowned brands such as Sofitel  MGallery  Art Series  Pullman  Swissôtel  Mövenpick  Grand Mercure  Peppers  The Sebel  Mantra  Handwritten Collection  Novotel  TRIBE  Mercure  BreakFree  ibis  ibis Styles and ibis budget  as well as Ennismore’s SO/  Mondrian  25hours  Hyde and JO&JOE.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

This requires critical service providers to implement holistic security governance and cybersecurity risk management plans in the face of the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks.Present on many critical systems  radio communications (Wi-Fi  4G  5G  etc.) have become increasingly complex to audit and monitor from a cybersecurity perspective. Customers will benefit from an end-to-end assessment of their vulnerability surface  enabling the identification of potential risks to better prepare for cyberattacks – especially those spread by radio. This approach helps prevent malicious acts that can undermine the operational availability of systems and data confidentiality.Eviden will be involved in the development and integration of the CIPHER platform  which comprises two core components:An automated vulnerability assessment mechanism to continuously identify vulnerabilities in systems  applications and components. It will rely on active and passive scans to detect known vulnerabilities  misconfigurations and points of exposure. The assessment is enriched with threat intelligence data and risk management tools for real-time contextualization. For radio networks  the system will support the cybersecurity assessment of wireless interfaces  complementing that performed by AI agents. Vulnerabilities will be automatically classified and prioritized according to their severity and integrated into an AI-driven classification.to continuously identify vulnerabilities in systems  applications and components.

For radio networks  the system will support the cybersecurity assessment of wireless interfaces  complementing that performed by AI agents. Vulnerabilities will be automatically classified and prioritized according to their severity and integrated into an AI-driven classification. An automated penetration testing framework to generate continuous  scalable security penetration tests that simulate real-world attack scenarios against critical assets. This framework will include the selection  adaptation and orchestration of open source and customized penetration testing tools. It will also implement attack scenarios and be capable of simulating various classes of threats (networks  applications  radio  etc.). The test results will feed into the CIPHER platform's risk assessment engine and AI-based recommendation systems to refine risk mitigation strategies  enrich and contextualize learnings  and refine results and reports.The solution will be developed in line with the ethical and sustainability principles promoted by the European Union. The AI-driven agents deployed in the platform will be fully aligned with the EU AI Act and GDPR to ensure transparency  accountability  and the ethical use of AI in cybersecurity operations. Furthermore  by embedding circular economy principles and energy-efficient digital practices  CIPHER promotes sustainable cybersecurity innovation and minimizes the environmental footprint of ICT operations.Bernard Payer  Senior Vice President  Head of Mission-Critical Systems  Eviden  Atos Group  said: ""It is with great pride that we join ECCC's CIPHER initiative to strengthen the cybersecurity capabilities of essential services across the entire spectrum  including radio equipment  in response to increasingly sophisticated threats targeting core IT infrastructures. Being recognized as a key player in the protection of European critical cyber assets reflects our ability to secure the digital chain of trust through a sovereign and certified offer that integrates the power of AI.""***About EvidenEviden is the Atos Group brand for hardware and software products with c. € 1 billion in revenue  operating in 36 countries and comprising four business units: advanced computing  cybersecurity products  mission-critical systems and vision AI.

We concluded that a refinancing initiative would further strengthen the Group’s financial structure - including: a long-term tranche to (i) optimize the balance sheet structure (long term liabilities vs. long term assets) following the funding of past investments (e.g. PanTera  mi2-factory  NHa) through operating cash flows and (ii) address a more structural working capital component (notably related to the Spanish proton therapy contracts); a specific tranche for potential future M&A transactions; committed revolving credit facilities (replacing the previously uncommitted bilateral credit lines). As a result  a refinancing package was secured  comprising €125 million bank facilities: (i) a €50 million 5-year amortizing term loan  (ii) a €15 million amortizing term loan for M&A purposes and (iii) €60 million revolving credit facilities  committed over 5 years. As of today  the amortizing term loan has been drawn up to €30 million  and the revolving credit facilities up to €20.6 million  leaving ample flexibility. The former bilateral revolving credit facilities have been terminated. This bank club deal is complemented by a €10 million 6-year subordinated loan from Wallonie Entreprendre. The outstanding subordinated loans (€7.5 million) will remain in place and be fully reimbursed by December 1  2026.Investments:PanTera: marked a major milestone with its factory groundbreaking event on October 2 nd   signaling the start of construction for its commercial-scale Ac-225 production facility.

SICAV RAIF (“EPIF” or the “Fund”)  through which it invests alongside selected co-investors. EPIF’s key strategy is to acquire small to mid-size real estate and real estate related assets in Southern Europe with the potential for attractive risk adjusted returns. The Fund initially closed with Eurocastle committing to invest €8 million alongside a €2 million commitment from its JV Partner.By the end of September 2025  EPIF had received over €61 million of capital commitments. In November 2025  an additional €20 million was raised  bringing total committed capital from investors in the Fund to over €81 million.In addition to Eurocastle generating attractive risk adjusted returns on its share of any investments made  subsidiaries of the Company are also entitled to market standard management and incentive fees from third-party investors.By the end of September 2025  EPIF had invested a total of €18.7 million to acquire three investments:Investments 1 & 2 - €7.2 million (October 2024 & April 2025) - Two commercial real estate properties in Athens  Greece  reflecting its focus on opportunistic investments with strong value-creation potential.Investment 3 - €11.5 million (August 2025) - An interest in a large portfolio of Italian real estate assets predominantly comprising office properties leased to government agencies. The assets are currently undergoing a disposal process  with EPIF acquiring its stake at a significant discount to the portfolio’s reported value.To fund these investments  EPIF had called approximately €19.2 million of capital by September 30  2025. At that date  the Fund reported a NAV of €19.9 million  approximately a 4% increase relative to the capital called  reflecting the appreciation in the value of the real estate acquired to date  net of all setup and running costs. Of the total capital called  Eurocastle invested €2.5 million  while its corresponding share of EPIF’s NAV stood at approximately €2.7 million.In parallel  EPIF has been underwriting a number of additional opportunities and has an active pipeline of potential investment opportunities exceeding €30 million.Additional ReservesAs at 30 September 2025  the remaining Additional Reserves of approximately €6.0 million relate exclusively to the legacy German tax matter. On 7 October 2025  after entering into a contractual arrangement related to the matter  the German Legacy tax reserve was released and the Company no longer holds any additional reserves.Board ChangesMr. Constantine (Dean) Michael Dakolias retired as a non-independent director of the Company with effect from 3 November 2025.

The Greek minister is currently running the Euronext acquisition of the Athens Stock Exchange  one of the biggest investments in decades  which will contribute to the overall upgrade of the Greek economy. “It is a very big vote of confidence. It is a reflection of the progress that has been made in our country in recent years ” says Mr. Pierrakakis on one of the two impressive developments of the last 24 hours that are linked to his own personal contribution to European affairs.He has not made any statements on the issue of Doniachos’ succession to the Eurogroup  but government sources  while avoiding commenting on the relevant reports  actually describe the country’s own upgrading from such a prospect. “We are not commenting on these reports; there is still no election process. However  it is positive for the country and for our economy  just to hear such a thing ” government sources stress  apparently attempting to feel more accurately the balances in this European field.So far  according to the Financial Times  three are on the list of main contenders: in addition to Kyriakos Pierrakakis  Belgium’s Vincent Van Peteghem  and Spain’s Carlos Cuerpo. The Spanish socialist minister ran against Donyahu last time as well  and it is not easy to withdraw. The majority of Eurogroup seats belong to the European People’s Party and possibly its alliances  strengthening the possibility of a candidate from that political family. Until the election of a new chairman  the duties will be carried out by Cypriot Finance Minister Makis Keraynos  and there will have been intense behind-the-scenes consultations and official contacts about the change of baton in the chairmanship of the body.Those in the know estimate that the correlations that will emerge are indeed shaped on the basis of the prevailing political group  but the dynamics of the individuals and the signs of writing during the previous moments of the battle will play a role in their final impression.The “standard” description of the current correlations is that in the 20 eurozone countries  7 ministers are fromEuropean People’s Party to which the New Republic belongs  7 from the European Socialist Party (and the German minister and vice-chancellor  Klingbeil is a social democrat)  4 from the Centrists of Europe (Macron’s and others) and two from the far-right.The emergence of new leadership undoubtedly points to a multi-level game  within and outside the countries of the immediate stakeholders. In such a game  extremely complex and difficult  the winner is usually the one who manages to break the “lines” and open bridges to potential allies by exploiting channels of communication of the situation.The meeting on digitisationKyriakos Pierrakakis has had a successful track record in European ministerial teams since his first term in the Digital Agenda. In fact  now being Minister of Economy and Finance on 20 September 2025 at the informal ECOFIN in Copenhagen  he was invited by the Danish Presidency to moderate the thematic debate on innovation and digitalisation. At the meeting  ministers exchanged views on reforms that can boost growth  as well as on prioritising strategic sectors and addressing obstacles that slow down Europe’s technological transformation.Mr. Pierrakakis  chairing the discussion  conveyed to his European counterparts his personal experience of the digital transformation of the Greek state and stressed that the promotion of innovation and digitalization is a central lever for boosting Europe’s productivity and competitiveness. He stressed the need to complete the single market  as proposed by the Letta and Draghi reports  with an emphasis on removing the “invisible barriers” that fragment the economy and limit scale. At the same time  he stressed the need to complete the Savings and Investment Union.As the Greek Minister then noted  the European Investment Bank has helped support start-ups through the European Investment Fund  but European start-ups must have the conditions to grow within the EU and on a large scale. A change in the way public procurement is carried out and a reduction in the time needed to implement it is crucial  he added. The experience of the pandemic and the European digital certificate have highlighted the importance of interoperability of services at the pan-European level. “The gains for citizens and businesses will be huge if we manage to achieve it in practice”  he stressed.It is noteworthy that after the end of the thematic session  Mr. Pierrakakis presented the conclusions of the discussion to the ECOFIN plenary session  in the presence of the President of the European Central Bank  Christine Lagarde  the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs  Valdis Dombrovskis  and the IMF’s Director for Europe  Alfred Kammer. The International Monetary Fund – it should be noted – has produced a report on the structural reforms it considers necessary to promote at the European level.With the German and the ItalianPierrakakis has held a series of meetings in the context of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings to exchange views and analyses of the situation with other top economy ministers and leading players in Europe.On 13 May  he met with European Commission Executive Vice-Presidents Stéphane Séjourné and Raffaele Fitto and Budget Commissioner Piotr Serafin  to whom he reiterated Greece’s full support for the Commission’s efforts to reach a trade agreement with the US. In the field of Defence  they discussed the critical importance of strengthening resources at both the European and national level  which will produce substantial benefits for the Union as a whole and for each Member State individually. At the same time  he stressed the need for Europe to focus on policies to strengthen its competitiveness through the promotion of our strategic priorities – and  in particular  the completion of the Banking Union and the launch of the digital euro.On the same day  he had the opportunity to congratulate in a one-to-one meeting the German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on taking up his new duties  while with his Italian counterpart Giancarlo Giorgetti i he focused on the issues of financing,neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,mixed,0.29,0.29,0.41,True,English,"['Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'main contender', 'Eurogroup chairmanship', 'government sources', 'Cypriot Finance Minister Makis Keraynos', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'two impressive developments', 'Vincent Van Peteghem', 'successful track record', 'Spanish socialist minister', 'prevailing political group', 'European ministerial teams', 'The Greek Minister', 'next Eurogroup/Ecofin meeting', 'relevant election process', 'European Socialist Party', 'Eurozone finance ministers', 'German minister', 'political family', 'Greek state', 'European affairs', 'European field', 'European People', 'European counterparts', 'major development', 'leading “players', 'Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'positive imprint', 'Digital Governance', 'key figure', 'high echelons', 'Irish counterpart', 'Pascal Donahue', 'World Bank', 'possible successors', 'Mr. Pierrakakis', 'crucial consultations', 'highest level', 'Irish Times', 'three contenders', 'top job', 'Euronext acquisition', 'biggest investments', 'overall upgrade', 'big vote', 'recent years', 'last 24 hours', 'personal contribution', 'Doniachos’ succession', 'government sources', 'relevant reports', 'Financial Times', 'main contenders', 'Carlos Cuerpo', 'new chairman', 'scenes consultations', 'official contacts', 'previous moments', 'final impression', 'standard” description', 'New Republic', 'social democrat', 'immediate stakeholders', 'potential allies', 'first term', 'Digital Agenda', 'informal ECOFIN', 'Danish Presidency', 'thematic debate', 'strategic sectors', 'technological transformation', 'personal experience', 'digital transformation', 'central lever', 'Greek economy', 'crucial duties', 'new duties', 'new leadership', 'international community', 'National Economy', 'Eurogroup seats', 'current correlations', 'multi-level game', 'eurozone countries', 'Eurogroup leadership', '7 ministers', 'Newsroom', 'country', 'role', 'backdrop', 'baton', 'March', 'ministries', 'Education', 'transition', 'decision', 'frame', 'months', 'post', 'relationship', 'trust', 'candidate', 'series', 'upper', 'December', 'publications', 'yesterday', 'rival', 'Belgian', 'Spaniard', 'decades', 'confidence', 'reflection', 'progress', 'statements', 'issue', 'upgrading', 'prospect', 'thing', 'balances', 'addition', 'Belgium', 'Spain', 'Donyahu', 'majority', 'alliances', 'possibility', 'chairmanship', 'body', 'basis', 'dynamics', 'individuals', 'signs', 'writing', 'battle', 'vice-chancellor', 'Klingbeil', 'Centrists', 'Macron', 'others', 'emergence', 'winner', 'lines', 'bridges', 'channels', 'communication', 'situation', 'digitisation', 'fact', '20 September', 'Copenhagen', 'innovation', 'digitalisation', 'views', 'reforms', 'growth', 'obstacles', 'discussion', 'promotion', 'digitalization', 'productivity', 'competitiveness', 'need', 'sing']",2025-11-20,2025-11-21,en.protothema.gr
