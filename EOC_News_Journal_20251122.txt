53841,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o,What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war,There are 28 key points and while several on the face of it could be acceptable to Ukraine  others cross Kyiv's red lines.,"What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war1 day ago Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share SaveMarharyta Fal/Frontliner/Getty ImagesThe draft US-Russia peace plan has been widely leaked and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Latest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600 000 people. But what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?What are the key points?There are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise. Ukraine's sovereignty would be ""confirmed"" and there would be a ""total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia  Ukraine and Europe""  with robust or reliable ""security guarantees"" for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days. If Russia were to invade Ukraine a ""robust co-ordinated military response"" is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal. Although elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place  they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed. But on security guarantees  there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.Handover of Ukraine's territory and cut in armed forcesAmong the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces. ""Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control  and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone  internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone."" Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk ""fortress belt"" cities of Slovyansk  Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight. ""The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600 000 personnel."" Ukraine's military was estimated last January at 880 000 active personnel  up from 250 000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While 600 000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime  that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept. ""Our red lines are clear and unwavering "" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: ""There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces."" The draft also proposes that ""Crimea  Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian  including by the United States"". In other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing  as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are "" indivisible and inviolable"". Elsewhere  in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia  the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.Ukraine's future - with EU but not NatoThe draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future: ""Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future."" ""Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated."" There is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries. Joining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: ""Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join."" Other draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a ""non-nuclear state"". That appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.Bringing Russia back from isolationSeveral points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with ""Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy"" and invited back into the G8 group of powers. That seems a long way off for now  with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later. If the UK  Canada  France  Germany  Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion  there's even less chance of that happening now.What about Russia's frozen assets?The draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested ""in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine""  with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction. This is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year  extracting an American price for involvement  and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills. The sums it mentions may not be sufficient  either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn). Some €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium  and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily. The rest of those frozen assets would go to a ""US-Russian investment vehicle""  under the draft  so Russia would see some of its money come back  but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.What is not in the plan?Several commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry  even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void. But it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.Is this a definitive peace plan?We know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an ""aggressive timeline"" with this draft  with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it. Equally US Secretary of State Marco Rubio  who was involved in drafting it  described it as ""a list of potential ideas for ending this war""  and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan  having spoken to the other key US official involved  Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. In some respects the draft document seems like work in progress  with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent. The European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet  and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.Is the draft a Putin wishlist?",neutral,0.0,0.5,0.49,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['US draft plan', 'Ukraine war', 'Russia', 'Paul Kirby Europe digital editor', 'industrial eastern Donbas region', 'complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement', 'Nato-style Article Five commitment', 'Donetsk ""fortress belt"" cities', 'short-term preferred market access', 'robust co-ordinated military response', 'draft US-Russia peace plan', 'US draft plan', 'important strategic hubs', 'de facto control', 'demilitarized buffer zone', 'European fighter jets', 'reliable ""security guarantees', 'UN security Council', 'Other draft proposals', 'Ukrainian Armed Forces', 'European market', 'peace deal', 'Ukrainian control', 'contentious proposals', 'Donetsk Oblast', 'withdrawal zone', 'demilitarised zone', 'other words', 'other countries', 'Russian control', '27 European countries', 'Ukrainian forces', 'Kyiv access', 'Ukrainian representative', 'Russian forces', 'Share Save', 'Marharyta Fal', 'Frontliner/Getty Images', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Latest versions', 'key points', 'vague promise', 'Russian Federation', 'million Ukrainians', 'most Ukrainians', 'full-scale invasion', 'red lines', 'Khrystyna Hayovyshyn', 'self defence', 'United States', 'southern regions', 'front lines', 'significant commitments', 'strategic future', 'little chance', 'recent months', 'sovereign right', 'nuclear state', 'Ukrainian territory', 'unoccupied territory', 'Ceding territory', 'EU membership', 'EU markets', 'snap elections', 'martial law', '880,000 active personnel', 'acceptable number', 'Ukrainian sovereignty', 'future deal', 'Ukraine war', '600,000 personnel', 'areas', 'text', 'size', '600,000 people', 'face', 'Others', 'total', 'demand', '100 days', 'restoration', 'sanctions', 'scrapping', 'place', 'detail', 'attack', 'Handover', 'part', 'quarter', 'Slovyansk', 'Kramatorsk', 'Druzhkivka', 'year', 'town', 'Pokrovsk', 'start', 'February', 'peacetime', 'kind', 'limitation', 'big', 'recognition', 'formal', 'limits', 'rights', 'capabilities', 'Crimea', 'Luhansk', 'phrasing', 'constitution', 'borders', 'Kherson', 'Zaporizhzia', 'statutes', 'provision', 'issue', 'stance', 'candidacy', 'document', 'views', 'Thursday', 'infringement', 'alliances', 'troops', 'Poland', 'West', 'Coalition', 'Willing', 'plans', 'France', 'police', 'isol']",2025-11-21,2025-11-22,bbc.com

The thorniest issue is that the assets are largely held in a facility in Belgium called Euroclear  which leaves the Belgians disproportionately exposed to the risks of retaliation by Russia.The EU’s idea is to use the assets to facilitate a loan for Ukraine which would only need to be repaid if Russia agrees to pay war reparations to Kyiv once a peace deal is signed.But Belgium has been hesitant to approve the plan because it is concerned about being held financially liable if Russia were to attempt to recoup the funds. This has put Belgium at odds with other EU members who are pushing for faster action to support Ukraine.Classic TrumpOn Friday  EU diplomats and officials said they feared the new Trump proposal would make it even harder to persuade Belgium to come on board. One official in an EU government said the U.S. plan was an argument against moving ahead with the reparations loan as the EU will face pressure from Trump to unfreeze the assets under a postwar settlement  leaving European taxpayers on the hook to repay Russia.A diplomat added the notion of America seeking to profit from assets held in Europe sounded like classic Trump.The details of the American plan are far from clear. However  the full text of the 28 points make plain that the Trump administration has designs on the frozen funds  with $100 billion to “be invested in U.S.-led efforts for Ukraine’s reconstruction and investment ” the document said. “The United States will receive 50% of the profit from this activity. Europe will add another $100 billion to increase total investment available for Ukraine’s recovery.

The increase in net cash used in operating activities is due to working capital evolution and  to a lesser extent  the net cash impact of the implementation of the Company’s previously disclosed pipeline prioritization plan initiated in the first half of 2025.Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to (€25.0) million  compared to €8.9 million generated for the same period in 2024. The change is mostly due to the variation in short-term2 deposits during the period.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €103.4 million  compared to €41.9 million in the same period in 2024. Net cash generated from financing activities during the first nine months of 2025 primarily comes from the receipt of gross proceeds of €115.6 million (net proceeds of €108.0 million) from the settlement in May 2025 of the second tranche4 of the structured financing announced by the Company in October 2024 (the “Structured Financing”). Net cash generated from financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was mainly comprised of (i) the second tranche of €25 million drawn in January 2024 under the unsecured loan agreement granted by the European Investment Bank  and (ii) the issuance of royalty certificates in July 2024 for €20.1 million.Over the first nine months of 2025  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€1.0) million  compared to none for the same period in 2024  due to the evolution of the EUR/USD exchange rate.Financial information after closing the accountsIn November 2025  the Company completed a public offering in the United States of 44 805 193 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately €149 million (€139.3 million net proceeds)5  including the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs.Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits  including the net proceeds from the public offering  should enable it to finance its operations until the end of the first quarter of 2027. Assuming the potential exercise in full of the Tranche 3 warrants issued in the Structured Financing for proceeds of up to €116.0 million  the Company estimates that such potential additional proceeds would enable it to finance its activities until the middle of the third quarter of 20276.RevenuesRevenues for the first nine months of 2025 amounted to €4.5 million  compared to none generated for the same period in 2024.Revenues recorded by the Company in the first nine months of 2025 consist mainly of the $10 million gross proceeds (net proceeds of €8.6 million) milestone payment invoiced to Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group (“CTTQ”) and the $5 million (€4.3 million) credit notes recognized under the license agreement with CTTQ following the closing of the second tranche of the Structured Financing in May 2025. The milestone payment from CTTQ was received in July 2025.***Next key milestones expectedTopline results of NATiV3 – expected in the second half of 2026Upcoming shareholders meetingCombined General Meeting of Shareholders – November 27  2025Upcoming investor conference participationEuronext Tech Leaders Forum – November 26  2025 – ParisPiper Sandler 37th Annual Healthcare Conference – December 2-4  2025 – New YorkUpcoming scientific conference participationMASH-TAG – January 7-11  2026 – Park CityNext financial results publicationFull-Year 2025 Revenues and cash and cash equivalents: Thursday  February 16  2026 (after U.S. market close)About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH.

Under the new approach  revenue from usage-based partnerships will be recorded gradually as services are utilised  rather than booked upfront when deals are signed.The change caused Ubisoft's net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio to shoot up to 1.81 as of September 30  well above the 1.5 limit set under certain financing agreements.""The delay can ... be explained by the need to restate last year's accounts and  above all  to validate the Tencent deal (which may still have had to satisfy a few conditions) since a covenant on a credit line had been exceeded "" analyst Corentin Marty from TP ICAP Midcap told Reuters in an email.Ubisoft said it was addressing the breach through an early repayment of around 286 million euros ($330 million) in outstanding loans using proceeds from Tencent's 1-billion-euro investment in Vantage Studios  a subsidiary managing the group's three flagship franchises.It said the repayment would help reduce its debt pile  which stood at 1.15 billion euros at the end of September.The Tencent transaction  announced in May  is expected to close in the coming days after meeting all outstanding conditions  Ubisoft added.QUARTERLY RESULTS BEAT EXPECTATIONSUbisoft's second-quarter net bookings rose 39 per cent to 490.8 million euros  exceeding its guidance of around 450 million. That was driven by stronger-than-expected performance across its catalogue and a meaningful contribution from TV adaptations of its games  it said.The company confirmed its full-year outlook for stable net bookings and an operating income around breakeven. It forecast third-quarter bookings of around 305 million euros.Full details of Ubisoft's new ""Creative Houses"" operating model will be unveiled in January 2026  CEO Yves Guillemot said in a statementUbisoft's global headcount stood at 17 097 at the end of September  down by about 1 500 over 12 months  as it pursues at least 100 million euros in cost savings this year. Duguet said the company had achieved close to 70 million euros of those cost reductions in the first half.($1 = 0.8676 euros)",negative,0.02,0.36,0.62,mixed,0.25,0.2,0.56,True,English,"['strong Q2 bookings', 'debt covenant breach', 'Ubisoft', 'report', 'new ""Creative Houses"" operating model', 'French video game group', 'analyst Corentin Marty', 'TP ICAP Midcap', 'three flagship franchises', 'CEO Yves Guillemot', 'second-quarter net bookings', 'stable net bookings', 'The Tencent transaction', 'key debt covenant', 'new approach', 'operating income', 'net debt', 'quarterly bookings', 'third-quarter bookings', 'debt pile', 'last minute', 'clear reason', 'volatile start', 'Chief Editor', 'biggest news', 'E.U.', 'news updates', 'promotional material', 'Loading Loading', 'finance chief', 'press call', 'usage-based partnerships', 'core profit', 'EBITDA) ratio', 'financing agreements', 'last year', 'Tencent deal', 'credit line', 'outstanding loans', '1-billion-euro investment', 'Vantage Studios', 'coming days', 'BEAT EXPECTATIONS', 'meaningful contribution', 'TV adaptations', 'full-year outlook', 'Full details', 'global headcount', 'cost savings', 'cost reductions', 'first half', '286 million euros', '1.15 billion euros', '490.8 million euros', '305 million euros', '100 million euros', '70 million euros', 'accounting change', 'partnership deals', 'several deals', 'Frederick Duguet', 'early repayment', 'outstanding conditions', 'QUARTERLY RESULTS', 'COVENANT BREACH', 'revenue recognition', 'week-long delay', '0.8676 euros', 'Ubisoft', 'guidance', 'Friday', 'publication', 'November', 'request', 'Euronext', 'trading', 'shares', 'bonds', 'postponement', 'time', '0900 GMT', 'course', '1024 GMT', 'Review', 'analysis', 'picks', 'service', 'persons', 'subscribe', 'Mediacorp', 'panel', 'auditors', 'restatement', 'fiscal', '2025 accounts', 'company', 'September', '1.5 limit', 'need', 'Reuters', 'email', 'proceeds', 'subsidiary', 'end', 'May', 'expected', 'performance', 'catalogue', 'games', 'breakeven', 'January', '12 months', 'close']",2025-11-21,2025-11-22,channelnewsasia.com

53847,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4129907.html,Orient Express and Chantiers de l’Atlantique celebrate a defining moment in the story of Orient Express Sailing Yachts: the keel laying of Orient Express Olympian  the brand’s second sailing yacht,The first block of Orient Express Olympian  the second sailing yacht of Orient Express Sailing Yachts  part of Accor Group  was laid down today at Chantiers de l’Atlantique.,Saint-Nazaire  France – The first block of Orient Express Olympian  the second sailing yacht of Orient Express Sailing Yachts  part of Accor Group  was laid down today at Chantiers de l'Atlantique.In keeping with maritime tradition  the keel laying officially marks the beginning of the vessel's assembly phase. The first steel plate had been cut ten months earlier  on January 30th  2025.This highly precise maneuver is carried out by one of the shipyard's two iconic gantry cranes. It consists in positioning on its keel blocks the first of the 17 sections that will form the yacht's steel hull.Once this stage is complete  construction will continue in the outfitting phase – the installation of all its refined interior features at a dedicated quay  until its delivery scheduled for spring 2027  one year after Orient Express Corinthian.This maritime tradition reflects a shared commitment to excellence and stands within the long history of major technological achievements. It also marks the continuation of the partnership between Orient Express and Chantiers de l'Atlantique – a collaboration that continues to push the boundaries of exceptional voyages and naval engineering expertise.This crucial stage is marked by what is known as the Coin Ceremony: during which newly minted coins will be placed on the first steel block  a symbolic gesture meant to bring the yacht good fortune throughout her construction and future voyages.A blend of technology and tradition  Orient Express Olympian will measure 220 meters (721ft) in length  and together with Orient Express Corinthian  will measure as the largest sailing yacht in the world. It will also benefit from the SolidSail innovation developed by Chantiers de l'Atlantique  a system designed to reduce atmospheric emissions.Three self-supporting and tilting masts equipped with a total sail surface of 4 500m2 -1 500 m² per sail — will allow  depending on wind conditions  full wind-powered propulsion  or a hybrid mode combining sails with engines running on liquefied natural gas (LNG). The rigging is fully automated and controlled from the wheelhouse.At the same time  a cutting edge technology known as dynamic positioning will allow the yacht to maintain its position in bays without dropping its anchor  thereby protecting the seabed in fragile and protected areas. Routes calculated by navigational systems and supported by technologies used in offshore racing will enable full use of wind power. These various features make it possible to exceed current environmental protection regulations.As Orient Express Olympian enters construction  Orient Express Corinthian hoists its sails and begins sea trials in December. Orient Express Corinthian will set sail in May 2026 in the Mediterranean  followed by the Caribbean under the trade winds. Reservations are now open for the 2026 season – and soon for 2027: https://sailing-yachts.orient-express.com/About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

This marks a pivotal milestone in Ubisoft’s transformation  significantly strengthening our financial position by bringing in €1.16 billion of cash  enabling the Group to deleverage  as planned. It will also empower Vantage Studios to accelerate the growth of our three flagship IPs under a dedicated leadership team.In a highly competitive market  Ubisoft delivered net bookings above guidance  on the back of stronger-than-expected partnerships that underscore the appeal and reach of our brands. Our portfolio showed contrasting dynamics this quarter  with softer trends for Rainbow Six Siege  reflecting a phase of evolution for the game in an intense FPS environment  offset by strong performances across the rest of the catalog. The Assassin’s Creed franchise exceeded our expectations  confirming its positive momentum and ability to engage players over time. The Division 2 also continued to perform strongly  benefiting from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC  with the game’s first semester already exceeding last year’s annual bookings.Additionally  the progress we’ve made in addressing our fixed cost base brings with it confidence that we can continue to drive structural efficiencies across the organization that  together with top line growth  will contribute to ensure a return to strong cash generation in the coming years.Vantage Studios represents a key element of the transformation of the company towards a new operating model built around Creative Houses. We will have finalized the design of this new organization by the end of the year. These Creative Houses will be autonomous  efficient  focused and accountable business units  each with its own leadership  creative vision and strategic roadmap. This Group-wide transformation reflects our ambition to renew how we create and operate in order to deliver great games for our players and lasting value for our partners and shareholders. The full details of this new operating model will be unveiled in January.”Q2/H1 ActivityNet bookings stood at €491m this quarter  above guidance and up 39% year-on-year. The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships  demonstrating the power and attractiveness of the Group’s portfolio as well as the meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series. Excluding partnerships  overall back-catalog this quarter was robust and in line with expectations  broadly stable year-on-year  but marked by contrasted dynamics.Overall  net bookings for the semester stood at €772 million  up 20% year-on-year  with 34 million MAUs and 88 million Unique Users across Consoles and PC  slightly down while excluding XDefiant from the base.The Assassin’s Creed® franchise posted a strong performance in Q2  with both Assassin’s Creed® Shadows and the rest of the brand’s catalog overperforming. In the year to date  Assassin’s Creed has generated 211 million session days  ~35% higher than the last two years’ average. Shadows benefitted from the launch of the New Game+ mode  which was widely anticipated by the community and introduced greater difficulty and new challenges for players. The Claws of Awaji expansion released on September 16 and contributed to re-engaging players. It was praised as a solid addition to the base game  offering new unique boss fights in a beautiful and dark atmosphere. Looking ahead  Assassin’s Creed Shadows will reach a broader audience with its launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. Beyond Shadows  the rest of the Assassin’s Creed back-catalog also performed strongly  highlighting the strength of the franchise. Turning to the current quarter  on November 18 launched Valley of Memory  a free major update for Assassin’s Creed Mirage which brought new content and a fresh chapter in Basim’s story set in AlUla. First feedback from the community is very positive  with player activity on Assassin’s Creed Mirage doubling following the launch of the update  enabling the game to reach the 10 million player mark.In a highly competitive FPS market  Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege continued to attract new players this quarter  with acquisition levels twice as high year-on-year  and sustain activity levels  with unique players stable quarter-on-quarter and up double-digit year-on-year. Session Days and Playtime also increased both sequentially and year-on-year. However  as part of the evolution of Siege and its move to free access  a temporary surge in cheating has impacted activity and player spending versus expectations. With additional resources now in place and further hires planned  the team has identified the main issues and is actively addressing them with a robust plan. Having focused most of this year on establishing a new foundation for the game  the team is exploring a new seasonal approach that introduces multiple updates throughout each season  focusing on the core gameplay experience and heavily engaged players. This shift is designed to offer a steadier stream of fresh experiences with more variety  keeping players engaged and supporting long-term franchise growth. The Siege community remains highly engaged and passionate about the game’s success. The development team is equally committed to working closely with players to address recent feedback  with a strong focus on anti-cheat measures and gameplay balance.As announced at the Munich Major on November 16  starting in Season 4  the team will double the number of anti-cheat updates per week and introduce new prevention solutions. On the balancing front  the team is accelerating efforts in Season 4  with four balancing updates per season planned for Year 11  aligned with the new content cadence. To celebrate Siege’s 10-year anniversary in December  players can look forward to daily rewards and a special in-game event launching mid-December.The Division® 2 continued to benefit from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC release in May  as well as regular content updates  continuing to attract new players to the game. Along with rising player numbers  player engagement is up  with a record second quarter in terms of Session Days since FY2020-21. The game’s performance this semester has already exceeded last year’s annual net bookings.Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora posted a strong performance this quarter on the back of the July third person update announcement  available for free for all players on December 5  that was widely anticipated by the community. The game also regained momentum with the announcement of the From the Ashes expansion.Star Wars Outlaws™ launched on Nintendo Switch 2 in September to strong critical and player reception. The release expanded the game’s audience and was praised for its exceptional visuals  technical optimization  smooth performance and seamless transition to Nintendo’s new hardware.Q3Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch  the animated Netflix series that premiered on October 14  delivered strong global engagement  landing in Netflix’s daily Top 10 across more than 12 countries  including six consecutive days in the U.S.  reflecting the franchise’s strong appeal. With an 86% Rotten Tomatoes score  the show has been praised for its animation quality  cinematic action sequences  and faithfulness to the franchise’s universe and timeline. Its renewal for a second season supports the long-term strategy to deepen engagement through cross-media partnerships  extending the reach of Ubisoft’s iconic gaming IPs across games  publishing  and screen adaptations. This strengthens the brand’s long-term value ahead of the Splinter Cell remake currently in development at the Ubisoft Toronto studio.Anno 117: Pax Romana launched on November 13 and marks a bold new chapter for the Anno franchise. Building on the series’ strong momentum and releasing simultaneously for the first time on PC and console  it showcases impressive scale  striking visual fidelity and a deep economic simulation. The title had already received strong industry recognition — including winning “Best PC Game” at Gamescom – and has now launched to strong critical reception with an 85 Metacritic score  the best score ever in the franchise  which translates into solid consumer spending growth after one week compared to the successful Anno 1800. IGN awarded it a 9/10  calling it “A gorgeous antique city-builder that is worthy of a standing ovation”. For the first time in the series  players can choose their starting province  each defined by distinct cultural identities and unique gameplay mechanics that emphasize player choice. These innovations expand the game’s depth and replayability  laying the foundations for sustained player engagement and a rich post-launch experience.The Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From The Ashes expansion is set to launch on December 19. Timed to coincide with the theatrical release of Avatar: Fire and Ash  this bold expansion sees players embark on the journey of So’lek  a battle-hardened Na’vi warrior who seeks revenge against the ruthless Ash clan. The expansion introduces new visceral gameplay set in a ravaged Kinglor Forest and unveils a new sub-region known as The Ravines.Group’s transformation is progressing wellClosing of the announced transaction with TencentAll conditions precedent of the transaction have been satisfied  enabling the sale of a minority stake in its New Subsidiary – Vantage Studios - to Tencent to close in the coming days. This marks a major milestone in Ubisoft’s transformation journey. The proceeds of this transaction will deleverage the Group on a consolidated non-IFRS net debt basis  while providing enhanced financial flexibility to support its strategic transformation.The first Creative House — built around the Assassin’s Creed  Far Cry  and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six franchises — will operate under three guiding principles: Autonomy  Focus  and Player Centricity. A new leadership team is being formed  including Heads of Franchises  to drive creative excellence and operational agility across each brand on their path to building annual billion-euro brand ecosystems.New operating model to be announced in January 2026By year end  the Group will have finalized the design of its new operating model built around Creative Houses  independent business units with the objective of driving stronger creative vision  greater focus  efficiency  autonomy and accountability. The full details of this model will be unveiled in January 2026.Strengthened balance sheetThe Group disposes of a non-IFRS net debt position of €1.15bn at end September that comes with a cash and cash equivalent position of €668m. The €1.16bn proceeds from the Tencent transaction will enable to deleverage the Group  and notably the early repayment of the Term Loan and Schuldschein loans  which have an outstanding principal amount of approximately €286 million3. Of note  €210m were due next month. Additionally  Ubisoft will cancel its undrawn Revolving Credit Facility and initiate discussions with its banking partners with the objective of putting in place a new facility designed to support its strategic ambitions  in line with the broader transformation currently underway.Cost reduction initiatives on trackUbisoft’s cost reduction program targeting at least €100m in fixed cost savings4 by FY2026-27 vs. FY2024-25 is on track and progressing well.Thanks to continued discipline in hiring and targeted restructuring efforts  Ubisoft’s global headcount stood at 17 097 at the end of September 2025  representing a decrease of around 1 500 employees over the past 12 months and about 700 since the end of March 2025. In October  a targeted Voluntary Leave Program and a proposed restructuring were introduced at our Nordic studios.The H1 FY2025-26 fixed cost base stood at around €701m  down €69m and 9% year-on-year  including a favorable foreign exchange impact.IFRS update: FY2024-25 restatement & impact on H1 FY2025-26 accountsFollowing its auditors' position as part of its review of the H1 financial accounts  the Company has reviewed its analysis relating to the IFRS 15 revenue recognition of a partnership in FY2024-25 that has led it to restate its FY2024-25 accounts as per IAS8. Utilization-based payment schedules lead this partnership to be recognized under IFRS15 as revenues over utilization. This position now applied by the Group going forward has also resulted in a partnership signed in Q2 FY2025-26 not being recognized in IFRS15 revenues.The above results in the Company not complying with its leverage covenant ratio under certain existing financing agreements at September 30  2025. However  this is being addressed by the aforementioned actions relating to the concerned debt instruments.The restatement of the prior-year financial accounts are detailed in the Appendix of the press release.
