The scheme is based on the assumption that Russia will eventually pay reparations to Ukraine  an outcome widely seen as unlikely.Moscow has said it regards any use of its assets as “theft” and has vowed to challenge it in court. The plan has also faced opposition from Belgium  which has demanded that all EU members share in the financial and legal risks associated with the move.In its article on Friday  Handelsblatt cited an unnamed high-ranking Belgian official  who said that “new risks for the reparations credit are already emerging. Because the peace plan that emerged this week provides for the immobilized Russian assets to be used differently.”The American proposal to settle the conflict between Russia and Ukraine “would oblige the EU to reimburse all diverted Russian funds ” according to the official.The plan has not been officially disclosed  but media reports claimed that it calls for $100 billion out of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to be allocated for the US-led reconstruction efforts in Ukraine  with the rest invested in joint projects between Washington and Moscow. The White House also reportedly expects Western Europe to contribute another $100 billion to rebuild Ukraine.Handelsblatt noted that the emergence of the plan has already jeopardized the timetable for the delivery of new financial aid that the EU promised to Kiev and that it “urgently needs.”The leaders of the EU  Germany  France  Britain  Canada  the Netherlands  Spain  Finland  Italy  Japan and Norway issued a joint statement on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Saturday  saying that the US proposal “includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace ” but adding that it would “require additional work.”On Friday  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the American plan has not yet been discussed “in detail ” but suggested that it could eventually “form the basis of a final peace settlement.”,neutral,0.0,0.7,0.3,neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,True,English,"['US peace plan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU attempts', 'media', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US-drafted Ukraine peace plan', 'The European Commission', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'US-led reconstruction efforts', 'The White House', 'final peace settlement', 'new financial aid', 'high-ranking Belgian official', 'frozen Russian assets', 'lasting peace', 'new risks', 'Russian funds', 'German newspaper', 'immobilized funds', 'legal risks', 'media reports', 'joint projects', 'Western Europe', 'joint statement', 'G20 summit', 'important elements', 'additional work', 'American plan', 'American proposal', 'US proposal', 'reparations credit', 'EU members', 'Washington', 'timetable', 'Brussels', 'Kiev', 'Handelsblatt', 'attempts', '€140 billion', 'loan', 'Moscow', 'Belgium', 'scheme', 'assumption', 'outcome', 'court', 'opposition', 'move', 'article', 'Friday', 'unnamed', 'conflict', 'rest', 'emergence', 'delivery', 'leaders', 'Germany', 'France', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'Finland', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Norway', 'sidelines', 'Saturday', 'just', 'detail', 'basis']",2025-11-23,2025-11-24,rt.com
