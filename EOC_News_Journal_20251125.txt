53855,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,http://foreignpolicy.com/2025/11/24/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-frozen-assets-central-bank-reserves/,The U.S.-Russia Plan Gives Trump a $300 Billion Signing Bonus,If Europe moves fast to seize Russian assets  it may be able to sink this bad deal.,However  the U.S.-Russia plan to end the war has other ideas for the future of these assets  which total roughly $300 billion and are mostly held at EU-based institutions. A clause in the 28-point road map suggests that the reserves would serve as the equivalent of a signing bonus for the United States  which may help explain U.S. President Donald Trump’s keen interest in quickly sealing the deal. While the provisions of the U.S.-Russia plan are alarming  they also present an opportunity for Europeans to potentially block it: If the EU seizes Russia’s central bank assets before Washington does  the bloc may be able to significantly curb Trump’s interest in what is a bad and dangerous deal for both Ukraine and Europe.Ukraine has been on a shopping spree lately. On Nov. 17  Kyiv announced plans to buy up to 100 French-made Rafale fighter jets over the next 10 years. Just a few weeks earlier  the Ukrainian government had disclosed a similar deal to purchase up to 150 Swedish Gripen jets. These announcements were not made at random: Ukraine has recently made a point of showing European Union countries that it would make good use of Russia’s immobilized central bank reserves if the bloc were to finally seize and transfer these assets to Kyiv’s coffers.Ukraine has been on a shopping spree lately.

Ukraine’s budget numbers for the next two years do not add up. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that Ukraine faces a budget gap of $65 billion in 2026-27—excluding military equipment and ammunition—and no source of funding has yet been confirmed. Once military expenses are factored in  the funding gap could reach $155 billion over the next two years. With the United States out of the equation and Ukrainian domestic revenues falling far short of covering war-fueled expenses  Europe is in the driver’s seat to help Ukraine plug its budget gap.Many observers believed that after years of wrangling  last month’s European Council meeting would strike a deal to seize Russia’s central bank assets. The parameters of such a scheme have been broadly agreed on: Financial institutions holding Russian central bank reserves would transfer the assets to the European Commission  which would then issue a $161 billion reparations loan to Ukraine. However  the loan is not a loan but an advance: Kyiv would repay the debt only if Moscow agreed to war reparations. France and Germany recently dropped their vetoes of the plan  paving the way for the seizure of the assets in time to finance Kyiv starting next year.Belgium derailed the October meeting by demanding that all EU member states guarantee the loan. Brussels’s concerns are not unfounded: Belgium-based Euroclear holds 86 percent of EU-held Russian state assets  meaning that Belgium could be liable if Russia successfully sues to get its money back. In November  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pressured Belgium by giving member states an ultimatum : They could support Ukraine either by seizing Russian assets or by taking on new debt. This was a smart move. Von der Leyen knows full well that EU capitals will resist adding new debt to their national balance sheets  making Russian assets the only viable option to bankroll Ukraine.Fast-forward to last week  when the Trump-endorsed plan reshuffled the cards. The deal stipulates that U.S. firms will get $100 billion in Russian frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction  with the U.S. government receiving 50 percent of the venture’s profits. This clause will not come as a surprise to observers of recent U.S. trade deals with Asian countries. As part of its July agreement with Washington  Tokyo committed to spending $550 billion of Japanese taxpayers’ money on U.S. soil by January 2029. South Korea will similarly invest $350 billion.The U.S.-Russia proposal contains two other financial clauses benefiting Washington. First  the remaining frozen funds  roughly $200 billion  would be used in a U.S.-Russia investment vehicle; thus  the United States would receive a $300 billion signing bonus if the plan goes through. Second  European taxpayers would cover another $100 billion of Ukraine’s reconstruction costs.These financial clauses signal brewing trans-Atlantic battles over the fate of Russia’s reserves. The United States holds only 1.5 percent —roughly $5 billion—of these assets  while EU countries collectively hold nearly three-quarters . This means that the proposed scheme effectively allows the United States to seize the EU’s claims to the assets. Some experts hope this makes the plan moot   but they may be overly optimistic. It is not hard to imagine how Washington could pressure the EU (see tariff threats ) and Euroclear (perhaps using blackmail over access to the U.S. dollar) to release the funds. There are precedents for such pressure. In 2012  the Belgium-based SWIFT financial network had no choice but to cut ties with Iranian banks amid intense pressure from Washington.Seen from Ukraine  the financial provisions of the U.S.-Russia plan  much like the rest of the plan  are catastrophic. A U.S. takeover of Russia’s frozen assets would cut off Kyiv’s only credible financial lifeline: the EU reparations loan secured by these assets. If the U.S.-Russia plan fails to bring peace  which is quite possible given its weak to nonexistent security guarantees  it will be difficult for Kyiv to finance military spending. In a final twist of fate  Ukraine has just started negotiations for a new loan with the IMF—a critical step for international donors to step in. However  the United States is the IMF’s largest shareholder  making a new loan unlikely without Trump’s support. Moreover  the fund can only lend to countries that have a reasonable chance of repaying their IMF debt. Without the EU loan  it is unclear how Kyiv could meet this criterion.The fate of the U.S.-Russia plan hinges on the EU’s ability to swiftly seize Russia’s frozen assets. If Belgium drops its opposition to a seizure and the EU quickly issues the reparations loan—meaning within days  not weeks—the bloc could make one of the key clauses of Trump’s plan moot  possibly making the entire agreement far less appealing to him.The question is no longer whether Russia’s central bank assets will be seized but by whom. Europeans have a choice: They can support Ukraine and use their best leverage to influence the U.S.-Russia plan  or they can allow Washington to confiscate the money for the United States and Russia’s benefit. Ironically  until last week  Washington had been an enthusiastic backer of the EU seizing Russian assets. Now  Trump wants them for America first.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.07,0.2,0.72,True,English,"['The U.S.-Russia Plan', '$300 Billion Signing Bonus', 'Trump', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'recent U.S. trade deals', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'The International Monetary Fund', '100 French-made Rafale fighter jets', 'U.S.-Russia plan', 'EU-held Russian state assets', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'U.S. firms', 'U.S. soil', 'U.S. government', '150 Swedish Gripen jets', 'European Union countries', 'European Council meeting', '28-point road map', 'national balance sheets', 'central bank assets', 'Ukrainian domestic revenues', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Japanese taxpayers’ money', 'next two years', '$161 billion reparations loan', 'EU member states', 'Trump-endorsed plan', 'Russian assets', 'next 10 years', 'Asian countries', 'Ukrainian government', 'October meeting', 'Ukrainian policymakers', 'United States', 'other ideas', 'EU-based institutions', 'signing bonus', 'shopping spree', 'good use', 'budget numbers', 'budget gap', 'military equipment', 'military expenses', 'war-fueled expenses', 'Financial institutions', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'smart move', 'viable option', 'last week', 'July agreement', 'South Korea', 'EU capitals', 'new debt', 'keen interest', 'dangerous deal', 'similar deal', 'up to', 'funding gap', 'Many observers', 'future', 'clause', 'equivalent', 'provisions', 'opportunity', 'Europeans', 'Washington', 'bloc', 'bad', 'Ukraine', 'Nov.', 'Kyiv', 'plans', 'announcements', 'coffers', 'night', 'IMF', 'ammunition', 'source', 'equation', 'driver', 'seat', 'wrangling', 'parameters', 'scheme', 'advance', 'Moscow', 'France', 'Germany', 'vetoes', 'way', 'seizure', 'time', 'Brussels', 'concerns', '86 percent', 'November', 'ultimatum', 'cards', 'reconstruction', '50 percent', 'venture', 'profits', 'surprise', 'part', 'Tokyo', 'January']",2025-11-24,2025-11-25,foreignpolicy.com

Clinically  we saw continued advancement of the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) program with completion of the Phase 3 head and neck cancer study sponsorship transfer to J&J in the majority of regions and first data from a Phase 1 esophageal cancer study supporting evaluation in yet another indication. In parallel  our Curadigm Nanoprimer program is rapidly emerging as a long-term growth driver for Nanobiotix. We are well positioned to accelerate our trajectory in 2026 and beyond.”Closing of the Royalty Financing TransactionThe closing of this royalty financing transaction with HCRx marks a significant milestone for the Company with an upfront payment of $50 million. The Company expects an additional $21 million in one year  subject to reaching certain conditions.HCRx will be compensated and repaid out of a capped portion of milestones and royalties on sales of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) payable to Nanobiotix under the Janssen license agreement. This repayment and compensation will be implemented through a trust established between (i) Nanobiotix as settlor and beneficiary  (ii) HCRx funds as beneficiaries  and (iii) European Investment Bank (“EIB”) as beneficiary. Furthermore  contractual covenants granted by Nanobiotix to HCRx regarding the proper implementation by Nanobiotix of the Janssen license agreement shall also benefit to EIB.2026 JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) Clinical Data Outlook for Studies Sponsored by Nanobiotix or MD AndersonFinal data from Nanobiotix Study 1100 evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) followed by pembrolizumab or nivolumab anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1Updated data from a Phase 1 MD Anderson study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are amenable to re-irradiationNew data from expansion cohort of a Phase 1 MD Anderson study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy (capecitabine) for patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancerUpdated results and establishment of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) from the proton therapy cohort of a Phase 1 MD Anderson study evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by photon or proton therapy for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancerThird Quarter Financial UpdatesCash  Cash Equivalents and Operating Runway:€20.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30  2025$50 million upfront payment to be received by Nanobiotix given the closing of the HCRx agreement  plus the additional $21 million expected one year post-closing upon reaching certain conditions  would extend cash visibility into early 2028About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

This is a key milestone in Sequana Medical’s U.S commercial roll-out following receipt of Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA. The alfapump System is the first active implantable medical device approved in the U.S. for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis that automatically and continuously removes ascites fluid from the abdomen into the bladder.The successful implantation was completed at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York where the team specializes in advanced procedures for patients with liver disease. Sequana Medical is executing its focused commercialization strategy through a specialty salesforce initially targeting the 90 U.S. liver transplant centers that perform more than 90% of liver transplants. Sequana Medical continues to make strong progress in the roll-out of this strategy as demonstrated by the number of hospitals trained and the progress in approvals to implant at these centers.Recurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle. This procedure often needs to be repeated weekly or monthly  requiring frequent hospital visits and causing significant disruption to patients’ daily lives.1 Sequana Medical estimates there are approximately 70 000 patients in the U.S. with recurrent or refractory ascites  representing a market opportunity in excess of $2 billion for the alfapump  forecast to reach 130 000 patients and over $5 billion by 2035  primarily driven by NASH/MASH and alcoholic liver disease.2Dr. Rahul Patel  Assistant Professor of Radiology and Surgery at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  commented: “The alfapump represents a significant advancement for our patients suffering from recurrent ascites. For too long  these patients have had to put up with repeated needle punctures  burdensome procedures to drain the ascites fluid. With the alfapump system  patients have this done automatically and continuously  avoiding the punctures and the hospital visits  and maintaining a flat abdomen. This groundbreaking technology offers our patients the potential for improved quality of life and reduced hospital visits  which is truly transformative for managing this challenging condition.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  continued: “Today marks a pivotal moment in Sequana Medical’s journey with our first commercial US implant. We are proud that it is taking place at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York  a top-tier US hospital with such a strong reputation in the field of hepatology and interventional radiology. Following years of investment in clinical development and laying the commercial foundations  we are positioned to deliver a breakthrough in the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Having recently returned from the annual meeting of the AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) in Washington DC  I am more excited than ever about the US market opportunity for the alfapump. At the meeting  I met with many US hepatologists and time after time I heard they share our vision of the alfapump replacing repeated puncture paracentesis in many of their patients. alfapump is a twenty-first century solution for the large and growing patient population that has clear unmet clinical needs and I am confident that we can capture significant market share and drive meaningful revenue growth.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917Media Relations:Josephine GalatiotoICR HealthcareE: Sequana@icrhealthcare.comT: +1 (332) 242-4388Important Safety InformationIndication for Use: The alfapump® System is intended for single patient use only in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis.

The safety and effectiveness of DSR® therapy has not been established.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical’s POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life3  4.Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.5 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1 2.Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

53877,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/slight-fall-in-number-of-women-directors-in-leading-irish-firms/a94734712.html,Slight fall in number of women directors in leading Irish firms,Women now make up 40pc of directors in ISEQ 20 companies  according to the latest annual analysis of Irish boardrooms by the consultancy Spencer Stuart.,​PTSB chairwoman Julie O’Neill (centre) is one of only two female chairs of a listed Irish company. She is pictured alongside PTSB head of asset finance Colm Furlong and CEO Eamonn Crowley (right). Photo: FennellWomen now make up 40pc of directors in ISEQ 20 companies  according to the latest annual analysis of Irish boardrooms by the consultancy Spencer Stuart.While this is a very slight decline on last year’s figure of 41pc  it represents a 54pc increase since the first index was drawn up in 2020. Women held just 8pc of directorships in all stock market-listed companies in 2013.Only two of the 20 boards have women chairs – Donna Troy at FD Technologies and Julie O’Neill at Permanent TSB.The index examines the 20 largest companies by market capitalisation on the Irish stock exchange. The year under review ended on April 30  with the main change in that time being the delisting of Smurfit Kappa from Euronext Dublin.It was replaced in the Iseq 20 by Mincon  which has the second-lowest proportion of female representation in the index at 29pc  with FD Technologies the lowest at 17pc.Ruth Curran  managing partner of Spencer Stuart Ireland  said gender equality is still making slow progress at a senior board level. “Men continue to dominate when it comes to CEOs  CFOs  chairs and senior independent directors  with women holding fewer than one in four of these roles ” she said.“More positively  though  15 of the ISEQ 20 do have a woman in one of these top four roles and with the total number of women on ISEQ boards up more than 50pc in the past five years  it will be interesting to see how long it takes for this to translate into greater balance in these more senior roles.”In total  20 new directors were appointed across nine listed boards  including five executive appointments. Glanbia  IRES  Origin Enterprises and FBD Holdings each appointed three  while Permanent TSB  Ryanair  and Cairn Homes all appointed two.The Ryanair appointees were Moroccan businesswoman Jinane Laghrari Laabi and former British minister Amber Rudd. The IRES Reit appointee were Richard Nesbitt and Amy Freedman.Bank of Ireland announced the appointment of Akshaya Bhargava as its chairperson.The average age of new directors was 57  while the average age for chairpersons is now 70  reflecting the fact that experience is considered a key requirement. The average age of directors on ISEQ 20 boards is 60.7 years.Two out of five non-executive directors are non-Irish nationals.The continued shrinking of the Irish stock exchange is a concern  Ms Curran said. “With fewer listed companies  the pipeline of future board-ready leaders is narrowing  as public company experience becomes increasingly scarce and prized  particularly for governance-heavy roles and board appointments ” she said.“This risks board refreshments becoming stale  as there is a smaller pool of experienced candidates to draw from.”Companies held more board meetings on average  up to 9.7 compared to 6.9 in 2024.The average fee for non-executive directors fell to €79 126  the first decline in five years  reflecting the fact that some high-fee companies have delisted from Euronext Dublin.Chairs received a fee ranging from €125 000 to €525 000  with 90pc of the companies paying in cash. The average is €241 952  down 8.6pc from €264 840 last year and down 12.8pc over five years  again reflecting the departure of the likes of CRH and Flutter from the Irish stock exchange.,neutral,0.02,0.6,0.38,mixed,0.12,0.29,0.58,True,English,"['leading Irish firms', 'Slight fall', 'women directors', 'number', 'Moroccan businesswoman Jinane Laghrari Laabi', 'former British minister Amber Rudd', 'The IRES Reit appointee', 'Julie O’Neill', 'CEO Eamonn Crowley', 'latest annual analysis', 'future board-ready leaders', 'listed Irish company', 'Irish stock exchange', 'The Ryanair appointees', 'five executive appointments', 'stock market-listed companies', 'top four roles', 'nine listed boards', 'fewer listed companies', 'public company experience', 'senior board level', 'senior independent directors', 'past five years', 'two female chairs', 'five non-executive directors', 'Spencer Stuart Ireland', 'board appointments', 'Irish boardrooms', 'senior roles', 'Irish nationals', 'female representation', 'board refreshments', 'board meetings', 'PTSB chairwoman', 'PTSB head', 'asset finance', 'Colm Furlong', 'slight decline', '54pc increase', 'Donna Troy', 'FD Technologies', 'Permanent TSB', '20 largest companies', 'market capitalisation', 'main change', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Euronext Dublin', 'lowest proportion', 'Ruth Curran', 'managing partner', 'gender equality', 'slow progress', 'greater balance', '20 new directors', 'Origin Enterprises', 'FBD Holdings', 'Cairn Homes', 'Richard Nesbitt', 'Amy Freedman', 'Akshaya Bhargava', 'key requirement', 'continued shrinking', 'Ms Curran', 'governance-heavy roles', 'smaller pool', 'experienced candidates', 'first decline', 'high-fee companies', 'average age', 'ISEQ 20 companies', 'ISEQ boards', 'ISEQ 20 boards', 'last year', 'total number', 'first index', 'average fee', 'women chairs', '60.7 years', 'Photo', 'Fennell', '40pc', 'consultancy', 'figure', '41pc', '8pc', 'directorships', 'review', 'April', 'time', 'delisting', 'Mincon', 'second', '29pc', '17pc', 'CEOs', 'CFOs', 'Glanbia', 'Bank', 'chairperson', 'fact', 'concern', 'pipeline', '90pc', 'cash', 'departure', 'likes', 'CRH', 'Flutter']",2025-11-24,2025-11-25,independent.ie

Apart from the fact that even Tsipras invoked Him in difficult moments (in Mati)  we also understood it ourselves from the way we survived after the SYRIZA five-year period. So what the wise people say — “Holy Mary  help” and “God protect us” — somehow… exists  hidden as a wish deep in time  and perhaps it even holds true. To be honest with you  I leafed through the book Ithaca and I’m conveying to you whatever I understood subjectively. Tsipras  it is certain  did not write this book to apologize for anything  or almost anything. If one considers that the pivotal point of his term was the referendum  the negotiation  and its outcome — yet another memorandum worth 80–100 billion euros — for this Tsipras does not seem to repent at all. On the contrary  he considers it the correct political move which benefited the country. Meaning that if you asked him today whether he would do it again  or whether he would “take” the alternative solution the Europeans were offering him from the spring of 2015  he would obviously answer in the affirmative. Nor did I read him admitting mistakes in other critical issues  except for Zoe and Varoufakis  with whom  however  he untangled things early  since the summer of 2015. The one he utterly humiliates  clearly intentionally  is poor Kasselakis  although he does not accept that he “foisted” him onto SYRIZA. And really  if you sit and write that Tyler was asking Betty how they would raise his children with Stefanos when they go to the Maximos Mansion… you understand!Novartis-familiesGenerally speaking I didn’t see him admit to having made a mistake  not even in the historical Novartis frame-up. There he says that “we shouldn’t have taken politicians to their natural judge but to a Preliminary Committee ” as if the Justice system were more controlled compared to the parliamentary majority he fully controlled. Even in his… attempt to make a supposed self-critique about the constant attacks on Mitsotakis’ family  he gives a completely ridiculous explanation regarding his wife  Mareva. Mitsotakis  he says  swept us away into mistakes with his communication mechanisms  resulting in “a state of siege and under the sway of anger  we adopted a tactic of highlighting scandals that concerned not only Mitsotakis but also the business activity of his wife…”. The truth of course is that he cultivated an entire media system to attack families  journalists  political opponents  etc.  from the first to the last day of his term. These things of course sometimes go wrong in life — not to say almost always — and today his opponents will be enjoying his misfortunes with popcorn.Small first conclusionNevertheless the book is very interesting because it is living history  and it will be read whether it enrages you or makes you happy because you are on the Left and nostalgically remember how lovely things were with Dritsas  Tasia  Filis  Zoe in her… right mind  and the rest of the crazy gang who brought us one step before the drachma. The book will get enormous publicity  it will raise limitless dust and disputes on both sides. It will… inevitably also assist the deeply wounded relationship of Samaras with ND  and ultimately it will benefit — gift  once again — Mitsotakis.And lastly: newspapers and shop windowsNaturally I will return more analytically after I study the leader’s book  but I want to close today’s commentary with something I read that touches me in the job I’ve done for 40 years. Tsipras recounts his famous meeting with Psycharis in a mutual friend’s house  shortly before taking power. The late Stavros  after starting off with the theory that they had to come to an understanding because DOL always belonged to the… Democratic Camp  told him that at that time (DOL) was facing major financial problems  obviously implying that the new SYRIZA regime could help them. Then Tsipras  according to his own narrative  countered that they (DOL) were politically attacking them  etc. And Psycharis replied with the line: “Look  Alexis… newspapers are like shop-window displays. One time they have summer clothes  one time winter clothes. The shop is the same. The display changes.” What Psycharis told him — in truth  in a very digestible and vivid way — was  is  and I think will be the norm between power and the media  regardless of whether the (transaction) did not flourish at the time. With exceptions  of course  that stand out…Cabinet meetingThe Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday was moved to Wednesday afternoon  as the funeral of Nikos Hardalias’ father intervenes. It has several items  from Justice issues regarding inheritances and Environmental provisions concerning spatial planning  and generally K.M. will give the final guidelines to the ministers for the year’s end.A party with a pulseThere may not have been many local derbies in ND’s Prefectural and Local Organizations  but Piraeus headquarters mobilized strongly yesterday and counted its members ahead of the elections. The mechanism warmed up a bit; 122 000 people entered the process to pay and register  and indeed at a time when internal party matters are not at their peak. What they retain in ND is that the mechanism showed vital signs ahead of the congress to be held after Easter and of course ahead of the elections. Not to mention that the numbers for ND’s Prefectural elections are larger than the internal elections for the Presidency in other parties.Geopolitical stress tests are coming to the banksThe SSM is attempting a closer approach regarding geopolitical risks for European banks. And because measurements in this case cannot be precise  it is virtually impossible for corresponding forecasts to be made. They would cost billions anyway. But although the approach seems somewhat lighter  in the end it becomes an additional headache for the banks. As far as our country is concerned  even without being in a red-hot zone  it constitutes a geopolitical area of increased priority for supervisors. Thus supervision is insistently asking Greek banks as well to “stress” similar data in the exercises they conduct  such as ICAAP for example  which is the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. This is an internal procedure banks apply to assess how resilient they are to adverse scenarios and how effective their risk-management processes are. To prove the point  JP Morgan’s Managing Director Kian Abouhossein raised the issue on Friday at the firm’s London road show  “interrogating” Pedro Machado  member of the ECB Supervisory Board. And he  among other things  answered that the thematic stress test for banks in 2026 will be an “inverse” exercise evaluating geopolitical-risk scenarios separately for each bank and their potential impact on each bank’s solvency. After all  this is the first priority of the SSM for the period 2026-2028: how banks will continue to strengthen their financial resilience in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Overall  discussions with banks  as he said  regarding the management of geopolitical risks continue and include the whole range: identifying these risks and of course taking the necessary actions to make banks more resilient to precisely these conditions.Signatures within the week for Ethniki InsuranceThe transaction for Ethniki Insurance is expected to be completed within the week. This means that the final signatures will be placed so that Piraeus Bank acquires 100% of the insurance company. And since the “what comes next” is always interesting  developments in the insurance scene around the country’s leading insurance company are expected. It is considered almost certain that sooner or later Ethniki Insurance will cooperate exclusively with its new shareholder. The above developments themselves set in motion the corresponding moves by National Bank to find a new insurance partner. Signing the agreement this week sets a milestone in that direction. The evolution at the level of bancassurance for all parties involved will become known in 2026.The ECB asks for more capital buffers from RevolutThe SSM released the results of the stress test on Pillar 2 capital buffer requirements for all major European banks  and the Greek ones have among the lowest requirements  below 3%. National Bank at 2.50%  Eurobank at 2.75%  Piraeus and Alpha at 2.90%. The requirements relate to how banks operate  how they comply with SSM rules and controls. The logic is that those who do not comply are more vulnerable and therefore more capital requirements are imposed on them. There were also banks that saw an increase in their Pillar 2 required capital  such as Revolut  which became a systemic bank last year  but for next year its Pillar 2 capital requirement increased by 80 basis points to 4.50%  the highest among the 105 banks.Turnover party today at the Stock ExchangeIt is not unlikely that the value of transactions in today’s stock-market session will reach even 1 billion euros  due to the MSCI index rebalancing. We will have an explosive increase in turnover in the Metlen Energy & Metals stock  which is leaving the MSCI Greece Standard to join MSCI Europe  and in addition we have the entry of Viohalco and Cenergy Holdings into the Small Cap. The game professionals have played lately was classic: pressure on the stocks that are leaving MSCI until the rebalancing is completed  and an upward push on the stocks entering the MSCI indices so they are bought at high prices on rebalancing day. All this in a market that is yielding three times more than any other European market (General Index +40.28%  Banking Index +79.67%  FTSE 25 +46.08%) and with heavyweight stocks (e.g. Alpha Bank +123%  Piraeus +82%  National Bank +70%) that are flooding foreign investors’ portfolios with profits as they close out for 2025  right after Black Friday.AKTOR Group ready for a retail bondThe AKTOR Group is preparing to issue a series of bonds worth 200 million euros  with a five-year duration  in order to borrow from savers at an interest rate close to 4%. At the beginning of the year  AKTOR had completed a 200-million-euro share capital increase  which was oversubscribed  to finance investments amounting to 2 billion euros. AKTOR is closely observing the success of retail bonds in the Greek market  especially after Greece’s upgrade to investment grade. The 4% for a five-year horizon for a group with a backlog that will reach 6 billion in 2025 sounds attractive. Over the past month  AKTOR Group’s stock has gained more than 11%  and its market capitalization is moving towards the target of 2 billion euros (today €1.89 billion).The difficult equation of the capital increase at ADMIEPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ recent reference from Singapore to the possibility of a capital increase at ADMIE confirms the activity surrounding the capital reinforcement of the operator. The aim is to ensure funding for the large ten-year development program worth 6 billion euros without losing state control  with the state retaining its statutory minority  meaning it must remain at 34%. The government team is fully aware that the ambitious grid interconnection program of the coming years—almost 6 billion euros—cannot move forward solely with own funds and European resources. The entry of new investors is now considered the only way  provided that public control is not undermined. In the background  American pressure appears to play a decisive role in the shareholding developments. Diplomatic sources report that Washington and Athens have repeatedly discussed reducing Chinese influence over energy infrastructure. And it is no coincidence that among the contenders for ADMIE (besides Italian TERNA  which had been mentioned in the past)  BlackRock has recently appeared  with market observers speaking of “multi-layered American activity.” Opposite these dynamics stands the Chinese giant State Grid  which with its 24% stake and enhanced rights acquired in 2017 remains a key factor. Sources familiar with the discussions claim that the Chinese do not desire conflict but request a “clear picture” of what the new shareholding structure will entail. The high quorum required for the capital increase essentially makes their consent necessary. According to information  the Maximos Mansion seeks to complete the process within the new year so that the investment momentum is not lost and uncertainty in the markets is not prolonged. The question is whether a formula can be achieved that keeps the State above 34%  brings in the American capital sought by the allies  and leaves China without reason to react. The backstage chatter says that a solution exists but requires delicate handling.The Sarantis era in IoanninaThe new era of Hellenic Dairies at Dodoni formally begins. After the approval of the deal by the Competition Commission  the acquisition was completed  and already since last Friday the company’s board was radically reshaped. Thus  Chairman of the Ioannina dairy industry becomes Stelios Sarantis  son of Michalis; CEO is Giorgos Sarantis  son of Takis; Vice-Chairman and head of market supervision matters is Mr. Athanasoulas Georgios; and Deputy CEO is Mr. Konstantinos Chytas. Mr. Vlachos Nikolaos also participates in the board as a member. According to the Sarantis brothers  Dodoni’s integration into the Hellenic Dairies group will be accompanied by a series of investments. We shall see…“Byzantino” returns to The IlisianA new gastronomic arrival—marking the first “opening” of the new destination to the general public—is in its final stage  namely the Japanese restaurant at “The Ilisian ” at the former Hilton Athens which closed in January 2022. The new restaurant  expected to become the city’s new gastronomic hotspot ahead of Christmas  has its entrance on Michalakopoulou Street  is housed in the new extension built onto the iconic property  and will overlook the impressive indoor pool of the new destination. At “The Ilisian ” the private members-only House of NYNN club has been operating since the summer  but now the destination is gradually opening to everyone—Athenians and visitors—as part of the major investment being carried out in the former Hilton building by the Konstantakopoulos–Olayan duo. The Japanese restaurant  with its impressive marble entrance on Michalakopoulou  is the first of the nine dining venues that “The Ilisian” will host  expected to open before the new year. From 2026 onward  the remaining venues will gradually follow: The emblematic Galaxy Bar on the top floor will be reintroduced as “The Galaxy Dispensary ” with a large collection of wines and premium spirits  and next to it “The Galaxy Supper Club ” a luxurious space that will elevate haute cuisine in Athens. Similarly  the “Byzantino” restaurant—a constant value from the past—will return in 2026 with a renewed appearance  while a Lounge Café Bar will operate from early morning until late at night in the hotel lobby.Optimism for 2026 early bookingsBased on early bookings for the 2026 season  Greek tourism appears to be moving positively  although—according to many in the sector last weekend at Xenia—it is currently running on “autopilot.” Nearly 85% of hotels  which are small and medium-sized businesses  “cannot secure financing  and access to capital is the exception ” said Giannis Chatzis  president of the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation  during the 13th general assembly of the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels last Saturday. Tourism stakeholders are awaiting on Wednesday the Ministry of Tourism’s event for the sector  attended also by the Prime Minister  and whether Kyriakos Mitsotakis will make announcements. Note that according to data from the Bank of Greece announced last Friday regarding the travel balance  even though September “slowed down” compared to last year—with 3.42 billion euros in revenue this year versus 3.55 billion last year during the same month—the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion euros for the first time  specifically reaching 20.13 billion euros  up 9% compared to the 18.47 billion in the January–September 2024 period.Wall Street is tightening for shipping companiesThe latest developments on Wall Street for shipping companies show that the game is changing—and in a way that resembles a silent shift rather than a dramatic maneuver. At the annual Marine Money Ship Finance Forum  the message was clear: the market for listed shipping companies in the U.S. has shrunk by nearly half over a decade  the result of a dual “cut” from mergers and privatizations. And even if the framework seems strictly technocratic  the essence is simple: companies that remain public have two choices—either grow or leave the exchange. The pressure stems not only from low valuations or compliance costs  but also from the fact that institutional investors are looking elsewhere. With less appetite for smaller shipping firms  well-established family-owned groups often choose to depart and return to the safety of private equity. Yet  even as the American market “tightens ” Greek shipping continues to maintain a notable presence with 31 listed companies. This is not only a matter of numbers but of stability in a market that is becoming increasingly selective. Greek shipowners  through smaller listings or larger structures  maintain their footprint  consistently seizing opportunities in public markets. At the same time  the major players who remain listed—especially in the tanker sector—now function as the “flagships” of Wall Street: large market caps  high liquidity  and greater support from the investment community. It is an environment where scale becomes a strategic advantage and where  in the future  we may see only a few strong players per sector.Aramco  the Americans  and Greece in the backgroundAramco’s recent moves in the U.S. are not simply business announcements; they indicate that the energy game around LNG is entering a new phase  with implications stretching from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. Aramco  traditionally oil-focused  has begun systematically expanding its presence in natural gas  signing agreements with American producers such as MidOcean (Lake Charles LNG) and Commonwealth LNG in Louisiana. These are projects totaling more than 25 mtpa  a scale capable of influencing future power dynamics in the global LNG market. Saudi Arabia is attempting to diversify its energy identity at a time when Europe and Asia seek stable LNG suppliers following the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. With more than 200 mtpa of new projects entering the market by 2030  whoever locks in strategic positions now will determine the future rules of the game. Moreover  strengthening U.S. production through foreign investment boosts America’s role as an energy superpower. This carries political weight in the Middle East  where Washington wants to maintain influence  and in the Eastern Mediterranean  where energy developments (Cyprus  Israel  Egypt) are at a critical point. And it opens a cycle of competition and opportunity for countries like Greece  which sees LNG taking a central role in its infrastructure—from Alexandroupoli to Revithoussa—making it a hub for flows toward the Balkans.Aristides and the… Pittas FundWhile the major players in containerships worry about the orderbook-mountain coming toward 2027  Aristides Pittas seems to be following a different strategy — one Wall Street describes with a single phrase: “locking in the upside before the music stops.” In the last quarter  the head of the U.S.-listed Euroseas did something reminiscent of a hedge fund manager in “protect the portfolio from any possible storm” mode. Four newbuild vessels that haven’t even hit the water yet secured four-year charters at $35 500 per day  and a fifth one  already at sea  locked in close to $33 500. Some in New York would call it “building my yield before the correction begins.” He believes the big wave of new capacity will pressure the mega-ships  but not the feeder containerships. In other words  he is positioning himself in a segment that is shrinking — therefore becoming increasingly scarce and  consequently  more profitable for those who already have exposure there. At the brokers’ tables  people comment that Pittas “closed his 2026 books before they even opened.” With already 70% coverage of the 2026 operating days  the model looks more like a tech company locking in recurring revenue than a classic shipping company playing spot-to-spot.The best quarter for HELEX and Bouzna’s plansThis afternoon  after the close of the session  HELEX will announce its Q3 results. Information converges toward the estimate that net profit for the third quarter will easily exceed €8 million — making this HELEX’s best quarter in the past 12 years. The HELEX share  at €5.96  trades at a discount of about -8% relative to its now-parent company  Euronext. For his part  Stéphane Bouzna has been giving interviews to international media in recent days  explaining Euronext’s broader plan. Of particular interest was his interview with CNBC  where — after praising the reform momentum of the Greek economy and reiterating plans to create a new technology and support hub in Athens now that the Athens Stock Exchange will migrate to Euronext’s advanced Optiq trading platform — he spoke about the broader strategy. Euronext is ready to contribute to the next level of market integration in Europe  creating a deeper liquidity pool for financing European entrepreneurship. He spoke about his contacts with the London Stock Exchange but did not hide that he also held discussions with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  explaining that it would be interesting for Deutsche Börse if it were willing to sell — in response to Chancellor Merz’s call for the creation of a pan-European stock exchange.The Trojan horse of… socialism in… golden CaliforniaIn California  200 billionaires have been counted  with combined wealth estimated at $2 trillion.California’s budget is on the edge of a cliff  especially after President Trump’s federal government decision to cut healthcare spending by at least $30 billion. Suddenly  someone threw out the idea: Let’s impose an extraordinary one-off 5% levy on the wealth of California’s 200 billionaires so we can all live better. The Medicaid cuts threaten 145 000 jobs in the healthcare sector. The truth is that today  1% of California taxpayers pay over 40% of the state’s income taxes. If yet another — “extraordinary  but who can be sure?” — 5% tax is imposed  how will the 200 billionaires react? Some will choose relocation to “friendlier” states such as Florida  Texas  or Nevada. Others will transfer ownership rights to trusts or offshore structures. Some will suspend planned investments in California  and others will reduce philanthropic and institutional funding. Triggered by the victory of the “socialist” Mamdani in New York  the debate is hot on California’s TV networks. The proposal faces constitutional obstacles  while previous similar initiatives were abandoned. California governor Gavin Newsom strongly opposes it. The healthcare workers’ union ignores him and pushes the vote forward.Ray Dalio no longer believes in bitcoinBillionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates  Ray Dalio  gave an interview to CNBC and revealed that he now holds only 1% of his portfolio in bitcoin. It is a position that resembles more a safety valve than an investment conviction. Dalio argued that bitcoin will never become a reserve currency for major countries because  after spectacular developments in quantum computing  the cryptocurrency can be detected  controlled  and — most importantly — compromised. That’s why Dalio again believes in gold. The truth is that in the past Dalio said quite the opposite about bitcoin (“it has proven its value… it hasn’t been hacked… it has stood the test of time”). But now that bitcoin’s exchange rate is collapsing  and after Google’s presentation of its quantum supercomputer  Dalio’s stance has changed dramatically… Yesterday  the bitcoin price had plunged to as low as $84 600 before recovering later above $86 700.,negative,0.03,0.33,0.64,mixed,0.3,0.14,0.56,True,English,"['Pope Alexios', 'poor comrades', 'shop windows', 'dancing', 'Infallible', 'Left', 'vaudeville', 'media', 'one time winter clothes', 'historical Novartis frame-up', 'major financial problems', 'Nikos Hardalias’ father', 'many local derbies', 'other critical issues', 'SYRIZA five-year period', 'new SYRIZA regime', 'Small first conclusion', 'The Cabinet meeting', 'entire media system', 'leader Alexis’ book', 'Justice system', 'summer clothes', 'Justice issues', 'famous meeting', 'journalistic celebration', 'Virgin Mary', 'difficult moments', 'wise people', 'Holy Mary', 'pivotal point', '80–100 billion euros', 'political move', 'alternative solution', 'poor Kasselakis', 'Maximos Mansion', 'natural judge', 'Preliminary Committee', 'parliamentary majority', 'constant attacks', 'ridiculous explanation', 'communication mechanisms', 'business activity', 'last day', 'right mind', 'crazy gang', 'enormous publicity', 'limitless dust', 'mutual friend', 'late Stavros', 'Democratic Camp', 'shop-window displays', 'Wednesday afternoon', 'several items', 'Environmental provisions', 'spatial planning', 'K.M.', 'final guidelines', 'political opponents', 'shop windows', 'vivid way', 'lovely things', 'Mitsotakis’ family', 'Newsroom', 'God', 'fact', 'Tsipras', 'Mati', 'wish', 'Ithaca', 'term', 'referendum', 'negotiation', 'outcome', 'memorandum', 'contrary', 'country', 'Europeans', 'spring', 'mistakes', 'Zoe', 'Varoufakis', 'Tyler', 'Betty', 'children', 'Stefanos', 'Novartis-families', 'politicians', 'attempt', 'wife', 'Mareva', 'state', 'siege', 'sway', 'anger', 'tactic', 'scandals', 'truth', 'course', 'journalists', 'life', 'misfortunes', 'popcorn', 'history', 'Left', 'Dritsas', 'Tasia', 'Filis', 'rest', 'drachma', 'disputes', 'sides', 'wounded', 'relationship', 'Samaras', 'gift', 'newspapers', 'commentary', 'something', 'job', '40 years', 'Psycharis', 'house', 'power', 'theory', 'understanding', 'DOL', 'narrative', 'digestible', 'transaction', 'exceptions', 'Tuesday', 'funeral', 'inheritances', 'ministers', 'party', 'pulse']",2025-11-24,2025-11-25,en.protothema.gr
