We have to get some leverage. The two things that provide access to negotiations are frozen assets  that’s one  and number two is the EU for Ukraine. That would provide something credible.”Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  the EU has frozen about €210 billion ($230 billion) in Russian central bank assets  most of them at Belgian clearing house Euroclear  out of some $300 billion in total blocked by the West.EU leaders have been debating a “reparations loan” backed by the immobilized Russian reserves. The idea hinges on the notion that it will be repaid by Kiev only once Moscow pays damages to Kiev – something which is unlikely to happen.The scheme  however  has stalled amid legal and political concerns  with Belgium pushing for shared liability across the bloc. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has branded the loan scheme a “theft ” warning that those who back the idea “will be prosecuted in one way or another.”Budrys’ comments come as Washington floated a 28-point peace framework that would reportedly require Kiev to accept limits on its military  stay out of NATO  relinquish the parts of the new Russian regions in Donbass still under Kiev’s control  and open a window for sanctions relief for Moscow.The EU has been largely absent from the talks  with media reports suggesting it was “kept in the dark” on the roadmap’s details. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later rejected the plan  insisting that Ukraine’s borders cannot be changed “by force.”,neutral,0.01,0.5,0.49,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Ukraine talks', 'member state', 'EU', 'ticket', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys', 'Belgian clearing house Euroclear', 'Russian central bank assets', '28-point peace framework', 'new Russian regions', 'frozen Russian assets', 'US-drafted peace plan', 'Russian reserves', 'relevant role', 'lost opportunity', 'first priority', 'two things', 'reparations loan', 'political concerns', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'one way', 'media reports', 'European Commission', 'ongoing talks', 'loan scheme', 'EU leaders', 'The EU', 'Ukraine conflict', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'say', 'Bloomberg', 'Monday', 'time', 'decision', 'ticket', 'table', 'leverage', 'access', 'negotiations', 'something', 'escalation', 'total', 'West', 'idea', 'notion', 'Moscow', 'damages', 'legal', 'Belgium', 'liability', 'comments', 'Washington', 'limits', 'military', 'NATO', 'parts', 'Donbass', 'control', 'window', 'sanctions', 'relief', 'dark', 'roadmap', 'details', 'borders', 'force']",2025-11-25,2025-11-26,rt.com

It is currently anticipated that the Paris Delisting will take effect on 31 December 2025.In April 2015  Nokia shares were listed on Euronext Paris in conjunction with the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent to ensure trading continuity for shareholders in France. The decision to delist was made following a review of the trading volumes  costs and administrative requirements related to Nokia’s listing on Euronext Paris.The Paris Delisting has been approved by the Board of Euronext Paris and will not have any impact on Nokia’s day-to-day operations in France  nor on Nokia’s listings on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki or on the New York Stock Exchange  where the Nokia shares trade in the form of American Depositary Receipts.A voluntary sales facility (the “Sales Facility”) will be put in place in accordance with Euronext Paris’ rules to allow shareholders to sell their Nokia shares listed on Euronext Paris and held through the facilities of Euroclear France (the “Nokia Euronext Shares”).The holders of Nokia Euronext Shares will have the following options:Not to participate in the voluntary Sales Facility and keep all of their Nokia Euronext Shares  which they will be able to trade on Euronext Paris until the delisting date (exclusive) and on Nasdaq Helsinki thereafter through the facilities of Euroclear Finland  subject to the terms applied by their financial intermediary and their custody arrangements; orTo participate in the voluntary Sales Facility (described below) to sell all or part of their Nokia Euronext Shares  in accordance with the rules and regulations of Euronext Paris.For the avoidance of doubt  holders of Nokia Euronext Shares will be able to trade on Euronext Paris until 30 December 2025 (the last trading date prior to the Paris Delisting).Procedure for the Voluntary Sales FacilityShareholders who wish to sell all or part of their Nokia Euronext Shares through the voluntary Sales Facility should request that their financial intermediaries deliver their Nokia Euronext Shares to Société Générale  acting as the centralizing agent  from 2 December 2025 to 15 December 2025 (inclusive).Nokia Euronext Shares delivered to Société Générale will be sold on Nasdaq Helsinki as of 2 January 2026 at the market price prevailing at the time of sale. For the avoidance of doubt  Nokia will not be a party to the sale of the Nokia Euronext Shares tendered in the Sales Facility  such facility being operated independently by Société Générale without Nokia’s involvement.Société Générale will calculate the average sale price of the Nokia Euronext Shares sold through the Sales Facility during the sales period and transfer the proceeds of the sale to the participating shareholders once the corresponding funds are fully received.Nokia will pay the fees for the centralization and the brokerage fees related to the sale of Nokia Euronext Shares delivered to Société Générale as part of the voluntary Sales Facility.This voluntary Sales Facility procedure is also described in a Euronext notice to be published on 27 November 2025.Please note that no guarantee can be given by Nokia or by Société Générale as to the price at which the Nokia Euronext Shares tendered pursuant to the voluntary Sales Facility will actually be sold. This process is being provided solely as an accommodation to holders of Nokia Euronext Shares.Holders of Nokia Euronext Shares may decide not to participate in the voluntary Sales Facility or may decide not to take any action  in which case no guarantee can be given to them on the terms that will be applied by their financial intermediary after the Paris Delisting.

53881,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.dw.com/en/can-europe-save-frozen-russian-assets-from-donald-trump/a-74885380,Can Europe save frozen Russian assets from Donald Trump? – DW – 11,After Trump's Ukraine peace proposal called for using frozen Russian assets to benefit the US  Europeans say only they can decide what to do with assets located in Europe. Experts say to move fast on a loan to Ukraine. Europeans are seething over US President…,"After Trump's Ukraine peace proposal called for using frozen Russian assets to benefit the US  Europeans say only they can decide what to do with assets located in Europe.Europeans are seething over US President Donald Trump's suggestion that billions in Russian assets frozen in European countries may be used to the benefit of the US government and firms.After a Trump proposal on how to end Russia's war in Ukraine that called on Ukraine to give up territory and reduce the size of its armed forces  Europeans rushed to damage control and have now floated a counteroffer.""Every day with input it changes "" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after meeting the Europeans on the sidelines of negotiations in Geneva.But it is unclear if they will succeed in retaining control over how Russian frozen assets are spent.Agathe Demarais  a senior policy fellow for geoeconomics at the ECFR  said billions in Russian assets appear to be Trump's key motivation in pushing for a deal.""Trump is extremely keen to get the billions "" she told DW.What are Russian frozen assets and where are they held?In 2022  when Russia invaded Ukraine  nearly €300 billion ($347 billion) of its assets were lying outside Russia and were frozen as a result of Western sanctions. These assets include bank accounts  securities  real estate and yachts.While many countries hold these assets  including the United States  Canada  the UK and Japan  the largest chunk lies in EU member countries  and the largest of all in Belgium.Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial depository  holds roughly €180 billion in frozen Russian assets.Since the war began  Europeans have been discussing if and how to use Russian assets to make Russia pay for the war it began. The last such discussion was held in October  when Belgium vetoed a ""reparations loan"" the EU wants offer to Ukraine to rebuild the nation.But Belgium fears legal troubles and that it may be the one Russia will eventually ask for its money back from. That's why Belgium refused to sign up and asked for the liability to be shared by other countries.The EU expected to assuage Belgian concerns and win it over at an upcoming summit in mid-December. But Trump's proposal has scuttled that plan and instead proposed what Demarais described as a proposal to ""confiscate Russian assets lying in Europe.""European powers have suggested their own proposal to end the war in Ukraine to counter Trump's contentious plan Image: Jim Watson/AFPWhat does the Trump proposal  and the European counterproposal  say on frozen assets?According to the US president's 28-point proposal as reported in various media  $100 billion (€86 billion) in frozen Russian assets would be invested in ""US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine."" Or as Demarais put it: Trump intends to take the first €86 billion out of Russian assets frozen in Europe  and use that to profit both the US government and US companies.The plan also states that Europe would add the same amount to increase investment available for Ukraine's reconstruction. This money that Trump wants Europe to contribute would not come from frozen Russian assets: ""That will come out of European taxpayers' pockets "" Demarais said.The rest of the frozen funds  still more than €200 billion  would be invested in a joint US-Russian investment vehicle  ""to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.""""This plan will benefit three entities- US companies  the US government and Russia "" Demarais said.The counter proposal by the European powers of Germany  France and the UK  calls for the use of sovereign Russian money for Ukraine's reconstruction. Moscow's assets frozen in Europe ""will remain frozen until Russia compensates damage to Ukraine "" according to the plan.""This is a way to simultaneously move forward somehow  but not yet confiscate Russian assets "" Philip Bednarczyk  Warsaw office director with the German Marshall Fund (GMF) of the US  told DW.""We are still [at an] in-between [point]  but certainly in a much better place than what was proposed in the 28-point Trump plan — giving the US and Russia both a say in where those frozen assets could go without consulting the Europeans "" Bednarczyk said.DW interview with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoCan the US use Russian assets located in Europe to benefit US firms?Jana Kobzova  Co-director of the European Security program at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR)  said the US ""only holds about $5 billion"" in frozen Russian assets and cannot decide how to use assets held in European countries.""The US can only decide about assets held in its own jurisdiction "" she said.In a paper for ECFR  Kobzova argued the Europeans must insist  ""that European publics would accept the use of European-based Russian assets to stabilize Ukraine "" and backfill European spending on the country's defense  ""but it would be hard to accept that these will just generate mega-profits for American investors.""European leaders have made their opposition to Trump's plan clear.""Russian assets based in Brussels cannot be paid out to the Americans  that is unthinkable "" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told DW in an exclusive interview.""The issues that concern  directly  the European Union  such as sanctions  enlargement or immobilized assets  require the full involvement in decisions by the European Union "" Antonio Costa  the EU council president  said.French President Emmanuel Macron told French radio station RTL that only Europeans can decide what to do with assets that are held by Europeans.Bednarczyk said principally the Europeans are not opposed to collaborating on a strategy with the US  and that under former president Joe Biden  they wanted to collectively decide how to deal with frozen Russian assets. But not anymore.""The dynamics have changed "" Bednarczyk said. ""Trump has much less regard for the European voice and often goes over Europe's head.""Europeans have long been discussing the use of frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild and defend itself Image: Daniel Torok/White House/ZUMA/picture allianceExperts argued it was time for the EU to get Belgium on board and move fast.""If the EU were to seize the assets and issue loans to Ukraine  Trump won't be able to get 300 billion euros anymore "" Demarais said.Edited by: Carla Bleiker",neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Donald Trump', 'Europe', 'DW', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'joint US-Russian investment vehicle', 'three entities- US companies', 'US President Donald Trump', 'German Marshall Fund', 'State Marco Rubio', 'senior policy fellow', 'Brussels-based financial depository', 'European Security program', 'Warsaw office director', 'European-based Russian assets', 'EU member countries', 'sovereign Russian money', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Ukraine peace proposal', '28-point Trump plan', 'European countries', '28-point proposal', 'many countries', 'other countries', 'European powers', 'European counterproposal', 'European taxpayers', 'European Council', 'European publics', 'European spending', 'armed forces', 'key motivation', 'Western sanctions', 'bank accounts', 'real estate', 'United States', 'largest chunk', 'reparations loan', 'legal troubles', 'The EU', 'Belgian concerns', 'upcoming summit', 'Jim Watson/AFP', 'various media', 'US-led efforts', 'same amount', 'strong incentive', 'between [point', 'web browser', 'Foreign Relations', 'American investors', 'US government', 'The US', 'counter proposal', 'contentious plan', 'Philip Bednarczyk', 'HTML5 video', 'Jana Kobzova', 'US firms', 'Trump proposal', 'DW interview', 'Agathe Demarais', 'one Russia', 'DW.', 'Europeans', 'suggestion', 'billions', 'benefit', 'territory', 'size', 'control', 'counteroffer', 'input', 'Secretary', 'sidelines', 'negotiations', 'Geneva', 'geoeconomics', 'ECFR', 'deal', 'result', 'securities', 'yachts', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'discussion', 'October', 'nation', 'liability', 'mid-December', 'Image', 'first €', 'reconstruction', 'pockets', 'rest', 'funds', 'conflict', 'Germany', 'France', 'use', 'Moscow', 'damage', 'way', 'GMF', 'place', 'say', 'JavaScript', 'jurisdiction', 'paper', 'country', 'defense', 'mega-profits']",2025-11-25,2025-11-26,dw.com

It is currently anticipated that the Paris Delisting will take effect on 31 December 2025.In April 2015  Nokia shares were listed on Euronext Paris in conjunction with the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent to ensure trading continuity for shareholders in France. The decision to delist was made following a review of the trading volumes  costs and administrative requirements related to Nokia’s listing on Euronext Paris.The Paris Delisting has been approved by the Board of Euronext Paris and will not have any impact on Nokia’s day-to-day operations in France  nor on Nokia’s listings on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki or on the New York Stock Exchange  where the Nokia shares trade in the form of American Depositary Receipts.A voluntary sales facility (the “Sales Facility”) will be put in place in accordance with Euronext Paris’ rules to allow shareholders to sell their Nokia shares listed on Euronext Paris and held through the facilities of Euroclear France (the “Nokia Euronext Shares”).The holders of Nokia Euronext Shares will have the following options:Not to participate in the voluntary Sales Facility and keep all of their Nokia Euronext Shares  which they will be able to trade on Euronext Paris until the delisting date (exclusive) and on Nasdaq Helsinki thereafter through the facilities of Euroclear Finland  subject to the terms applied by their financial intermediary and their custody arrangements; orTo participate in the voluntary Sales Facility (described below) to sell all or part of their Nokia Euronext Shares  in accordance with the rules and regulations of Euronext Paris.For the avoidance of doubt  holders of Nokia Euronext Shares will be able to trade on Euronext Paris until 30 December 2025 (the last trading date prior to the Paris Delisting).Procedure for the Voluntary Sales FacilityShareholders who wish to sell all or part of their Nokia Euronext Shares through the voluntary Sales Facility should request that their financial intermediaries deliver their Nokia Euronext Shares to Société Générale  acting as the centralizing agent  from 2 December 2025 to 15 December 2025 (inclusive).Nokia Euronext Shares delivered to Société Générale will be sold on Nasdaq Helsinki as of 2 January 2026 at the market price prevailing at the time of sale. For the avoidance of doubt  Nokia will not be a party to the sale of the Nokia Euronext Shares tendered in the Sales Facility  such facility being operated independently by Société Générale without Nokia’s involvement.Société Générale will calculate the average sale price of the Nokia Euronext Shares sold through the Sales Facility during the sales period and transfer the proceeds of the sale to the participating shareholders once the corresponding funds are fully received.Nokia will pay the fees for the centralization and the brokerage fees related to the sale of Nokia Euronext Shares delivered to Société Générale as part of the voluntary Sales Facility.This voluntary Sales Facility procedure is also described in a Euronext notice to be published on 27 November 2025.Please note that no guarantee can be given by Nokia or by Société Générale as to the price at which the Nokia Euronext Shares tendered pursuant to the voluntary Sales Facility will actually be sold. This process is being provided solely as an accommodation to holders of Nokia Euronext Shares.Holders of Nokia Euronext Shares may decide not to participate in the voluntary Sales Facility or may decide not to take any action  in which case no guarantee can be given to them on the terms that will be applied by their financial intermediary after the Paris Delisting.

This year’s UN Women theme focuses on digital violence against women  an increasingly urgent issue that affects millions worldwide.National Silly Sock Day represents a major milestone in Accor Pacific’s partnership with DV Collective and reflects the Group’s belief in the power of community-led action. Across Australia  more than 5 000 pairs of limited-edition socks are available for purchase from participating Accor hotels  with all proceeds going directly toward placing additional beds in domestic violence shelters that urgently need support. Every pair sold helps provide safe nights for women and children when they need it most and helps expand DV Collective’s rapidly growing network of shelters  frontline services and counselling organisations.This year’s inaugural Silly Sock design was created by Tshering Gyem from Mercure Perth  whose artwork was selected from entries across the Accor Pacific network. Her design is a wearable expression of Accor’s purpose – pioneering responsible hospitality  connecting cultures with heartfelt care. Tshering’s design brings this purpose vividly to life. At the top of the sock  red heart-shaped threads weave across the fabric  symbolising the emotional bonds that connect Accor’s teams  guests and partners.Accor’s partnership with DV Collective began earlier this year through the Accor Community Fund  with an initial $20 000 contribution made to support DV Collective’s mission of reducing the devastating impact of domestic and family violence in Australia. The organisation works to eliminate the waitlists and resource shortages that prevent women from accessing safe accommodation  legal support  trauma recovery programmes  counselling and essential materials.DV Collective now supports more than 300 frontline services nationwide  including 75 women’s shelters  and has this year alone contributed an additional 80 beds  representing more than 29 000 safe nights  alongside more than 100 000 donated hygiene and essential items. With incidents increasing and shelters under extraordinary pressure  their goal for 2026 is to place 500 new beds into the system  a target that National Silly Sock Day will directly contribute to.Accor’s Chief Operating Officerin the Pacific region  Adrian Williams  said the creation of National Silly Sock Day affirmed the Group’s commitment to the cause: Domestic violence affects far too many families in Australia  and the lack of safe accommodation is one of the most critical barriers for women and children seeking help. National Silly Sock Day is a simple but powerful way for our teams  guests and communities to come together and drive real impact. Every pair purchased brings us closer to ensuring that no woman or child is turned away when they need safety.DV Collective Founder  Kylie Johanson  said the initiative could not have come at a more important time: One in four women in Australia experiences domestic or family violence  and one in two women seeking shelter is turned away because there are not enough beds. We are proud to partner with Accor to activate this initiative and to expand our ability to provide beds  resources and support to those who need it most.The initiative has been supported by three weeks of internal communication across Accor’s Pacific network  engaging thousands of Heartists* in fundraising  storytelling and team activations. Hotels across the country are hosting displays  morning teas  guest offers and fundraising moments  all designed to draw attention to the scale of the issue and the difference that collective action can make.National Silly Sock Day will be held annually on 25 November  with a new sock design released each year.Members of the public can purchase socks or donate directly by visiting dvcollective.org or by purchasing through participating Accor hotels.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world-leading hospitality group offering stays and experiences across more than 110 countries with over 5 600 hotels and resorts  10 000 bars & restaurants  wellness facilities and flexible workspaces.

Important data will be reported in 2026 and 2027 in HNSCC  both in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts  while Transgene advances toward the potential start of a Phase 3 trial in this indication.With this fundraising  we can move forward to achieve our ambition: to develop next-generation individualized therapeutic vaccines designed to address the needs of patients with early-stage cancers living with a high risk of relapse.”FUNDRAISING: PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND PRIMARYBID OFFERINGUse of the net proceeds from the FundraisingThe Company intends to use the maximum net proceeds from the Fundraising of approximately 103 million euros  for the following purposes (in decreasing order of strategic priority):up to c.70% to finance the acceleration of the myvac® program  including the conduct of the ongoing Phase 2 trial in head and neck cancer  the launch of a Phase 1 trial in a new indication  the optimization of manufacturing and initial work to prepare the Company to launch a pivotal trial in head and neck cancer;up to c.20% to finance R&D current costs principally related to supporting the acceleration of the myvac® program  as well as the completion of clinical trials not related to the myvac® platform;the remainder to finance  together with the Company’s operating revenues  general and administrative expenses  as well as recurring cash consumption of the Company.The Company estimates that  in this scenario  the net proceeds from the Fundraising  combined with its existing cash  will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for its activities until early 2028.To date and prior to the Fundraising  the Company has €11.1 million in cash and a drawing capacity of €8.7 million on the Current Account Advance (€39.4 million drawn down  interest included  out of an available total of €48 million  following a partial repayment of the Current Account Advance in the amount of €8.1 million that took place after 30 September 2025).1As presented in its 2025 half‑year financial report  and prior to completion of the Fundraising  the Company was financed until the end of December 2026 thanks to the Current Account Advance and a letter of support from TSGH. Following the completion of the Reserved Capital Increase  the Current Account Advance Agreement will be terminated  and given the new early 2028 cash horizon (if the Fundraising takes place for the contemplated amount)  the letter of support of TSGH will become moot.Subscription commitmentAs part of the Private Placement  TSGH has irrevocably committed to subscribe for at least €70 million. This order will be placed ""at any price"" and may be reduced in the event of strong demand from other investors.Two other existing shareholders (including Dassault Group (SITAM Belgium) have indicated their intention to participate for an amount of €10 million to the Private Placement.Expected key milestonesDuring this period  and subject to the completion of the Fundraising  the following milestones for the myvac® platform are expected to occur:Part 1 of the Phase 1/2 trial in head and neck cancers:Q2/Q3 2026: 3-year follow-up (disease-free survival) Q2/Q3 2027: 4-year follow-up (disease-free survival) Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 trial in head and neck cancers:Q1 2026: end of randomisation H2 2026: initial immunogenicity data Q4 2027/Q1 2028: efficacy data  two-year disease-free survival Phase 1 trial in a new indication:Launch as soon as all conditions are met  including its financing through the current fundraising Preparation for late-stage and pivotal trials (GMP manufacturing  alignment with FDA and EMA): end 2027.Terms of the FundraisingThe Fundraising will be carried out in two separate and concurrent components under the same pricing conditions:an offering without shareholders' preferential subscription rights to the benefit of qualified investors or a restricted circle of investors within the meaning of Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code  meeting the characteristics set out in the 22nd resolution of the Company's ordinary and extraordinary annual general meeting of shareholders held on 15 May 2025 (the ""General Meeting"") (the ""Private Placement"")  anda public offering  without shareholders' preferential subscription rights  to retail investors via the PrimaryBid platform  in France and in certain European Union countries (where it is technically feasible)  in accordance with the 20th resolution of the General Meeting (the ""PrimaryBid Offering"").The launch of the Fundraising was decided today by the Chief Executive Officer  acting upon sub-delegation granted by the Company's Board of Directors on 24 November 2025 acting pursuant to the delegation granted by the General Meeting the above-mentioned resolutions.The Private Placement will be directed to (i) qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  as amended (the ""Prospectus Regulation"") or in other circumstances falling within the scope of Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation in the European Union (including France) and outside the European Union  with the exception of the United States  the United Kingdom  Canada  Australia  South Africa and Japan  and (ii) to certain institutional investors in the United States.The amount of the Fundraising will depend exclusively on the orders received for each of the above-mentioned components  with no possibility of reallocating the amounts committed to the Private Placement and to the PrimaryBid Offering.

The occurrence of all or part of these risks is likely to have an adverse effect on the Company's business  financial position  results  development  or prospects.Without changing the classification of risk factor 2.2.1.2 ""Dependence on partners"" (probability of occurrence ""medium"" and potential impact ""critical"")  the Company indicates that it is currently in negotiations with its partner NEC to amend their collaboration agreement (described in paragraph 1.2.3 of the Universal Registration Document). If these negotiations are unsuccessful  this could have an impact on the development of the myvac® program in the head and neck indication  and in particular on the development timeframe. Similarly  without changing the classification of risk factor 2.2.5.1 ""Need for a specific industrial tool that is difficult to scale up industrially  both internally and externally"" (low probability of occurrence and critical potential impact) and that of risk factor 2.2.5.3 ""Dependence on subcontractors"" (probability of occurrence ""medium"" and potential impact ""critical"")  the Company is also in negotiations with a manufacturer for  (i) on the one hand and for the immediate future  the manufacture of its clinical batches on cell lines  and (ii) on the other hand  for a technology transfer from this manufacturer to the Company to enable it to eventually carry out cell line production itself. If these negotiations are unsuccessful  the Company's ability to change subcontractors within a reasonable time frame would be limited  and the Company would experience significant delays in the development of its cell line-based drug candidates.Finally  investors are invited to consider the following risks: (i) the market price of the Company's shares may fluctuate and fall below the price of the Fundraising and the Reserved Capital Increase  (ii) the volatility and liquidity of the Company's shares may fluctuate significantly  (iii) sales of the Company's shares may occur on the market and have a negative impact on the market price of the shares  and (iv) the Company's shareholders could suffer potentially significant dilution as a result of any future capital increases necessary to finance the Company. In this context  the Company reiterates the following risk factors from the Universal Registration Document: 2.2.2.1 ""Possible exhaustion of available funds "" 2.2.2.2 ""Expected increase in capital requirements "" 2.2.2.3 ""Uncertain realization of revenue from partnerships "" 2.2.2.4 ""Possible adverse effect of financing efforts on existing shareholders"" and 2.2.2.5 ""Increased liquidity and partnership structures.""In any event  it is recommended that you consult Section 2 ""Risk Factors"" of the Universal Registration Document for a detailed description of these risks.

Important data will be reported in 2026 and 2027 in HNSCC  both in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts  while Transgene advances toward the potential start of a Phase 3 trial in this indication.With this fundraising  we can move forward to achieve our ambition: to develop next-generation individualized therapeutic vaccines designed to address the needs of patients with early-stage cancers living with a high risk of relapse.”FUNDRAISING: PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND PRIMARYBID OFFERINGUse of the net proceeds from the FundraisingThe Company intends to use the maximum net proceeds from the Fundraising of approximately 103 million euros  for the following purposes (in decreasing order of strategic priority):up to c.70% to finance the acceleration of the myvac® program  including the conduct of the ongoing Phase 2 trial in head and neck cancer  the launch of a Phase 1 trial in a new indication  the optimization of manufacturing and initial work to prepare the Company to launch a pivotal trial in head and neck cancer;up to c.20% to finance R&D current costs principally related to supporting the acceleration of the myvac® program  as well as the completion of clinical trials not related to the myvac® platform;the remainder to finance  together with the Company’s operating revenues  general and administrative expenses  as well as recurring cash consumption of the Company.The Company estimates that  in this scenario  the net proceeds from the Fundraising  combined with its existing cash  will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for its activities until early 2028.To date and prior to the Fundraising  the Company has €11.1 million in cash and a drawing capacity of €8.7 million on the Current Account Advance (€39.4 million drawn down  interest included  out of an available total of €48 million  following a partial repayment of the Current Account Advance in the amount of €8.1 million that took place after 30 September 2025).1As presented in its 2025 half‑year financial report  and prior to completion of the Fundraising  the Company was financed until the end of December 2026 thanks to the Current Account Advance and a letter of support from TSGH. Following the completion of the Reserved Capital Increase  the Current Account Advance Agreement will be terminated  and given the new early 2028 cash horizon (if the Fundraising takes place for the contemplated amount)  the letter of support of TSGH will become moot.Subscription commitmentAs part of the Private Placement  TSGH has irrevocably committed to subscribe for at least €70 million. This order will be placed ""at any price"" and may be reduced in the event of strong demand from other investors.Two other existing shareholders (including Dassault Group (SITAM Belgium) have indicated their intention to participate for an amount of €10 million to the Private Placement.Expected key milestonesDuring this period  and subject to the completion of the Fundraising  the following milestones for the myvac® platform are expected to occur:Part 1 of the Phase 1/2 trial in head and neck cancers:Q2/Q3 2026: 3-year follow-up (disease-free survival) Q2/Q3 2027: 4-year follow-up (disease-free survival) Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 trial in head and neck cancers:Q1 2026: end of randomisation H2 2026: initial immunogenicity data Q4 2027/Q1 2028: efficacy data  two-year disease-free survival Phase 1 trial in a new indication:Launch as soon as all conditions are met  including its financing through the current fundraising Preparation for late-stage and pivotal trials (GMP manufacturing  alignment with FDA and EMA): end 2027.Terms of the FundraisingThe Fundraising will be carried out in two separate and concurrent components under the same pricing conditions:an offering without shareholders' preferential subscription rights to the benefit of qualified investors or a restricted circle of investors within the meaning of Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code  meeting the characteristics set out in the 22nd resolution of the Company's ordinary and extraordinary annual general meeting of shareholders held on 15 May 2025 (the ""General Meeting"") (the ""Private Placement"")  anda public offering  without shareholders' preferential subscription rights  to retail investors via the PrimaryBid platform  in France and in certain European Union countries (where it is technically feasible)  in accordance with the 20th resolution of the General Meeting (the ""PrimaryBid Offering"").The launch of the Fundraising was decided today by the Chief Executive Officer  acting upon sub-delegation granted by the Company's Board of Directors on 24 November 2025 acting pursuant to the delegation granted by the General Meeting the above-mentioned resolutions.The Private Placement will be directed to (i) qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017  as amended (the ""Prospectus Regulation"") or in other circumstances falling within the scope of Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation in the European Union (including France) and outside the European Union  with the exception of the United States  the United Kingdom  Canada  Australia  South Africa and Japan  and (ii) to certain institutional investors in the United States.The amount of the Fundraising will depend exclusively on the orders received for each of the above-mentioned components  with no possibility of reallocating the amounts committed to the Private Placement and to the PrimaryBid Offering.

The occurrence of all or part of these risks is likely to have an adverse effect on the Company's business  financial position  results  development  or prospects.Without changing the classification of risk factor 2.2.1.2 ""Dependence on partners"" (probability of occurrence ""medium"" and potential impact ""critical"")  the Company indicates that it is currently in negotiations with its partner NEC to amend their collaboration agreement (described in paragraph 1.2.3 of the Universal Registration Document). If these negotiations are unsuccessful  this could have an impact on the development of the myvac® program in the head and neck indication  and in particular on the development timeframe. Similarly  without changing the classification of risk factor 2.2.5.1 ""Need for a specific industrial tool that is difficult to scale up industrially  both internally and externally"" (low probability of occurrence and critical potential impact) and that of risk factor 2.2.5.3 ""Dependence on subcontractors"" (probability of occurrence ""medium"" and potential impact ""critical"")  the Company is also in negotiations with a manufacturer for  (i) on the one hand and for the immediate future  the manufacture of its clinical batches on cell lines  and (ii) on the other hand  for a technology transfer from this manufacturer to the Company to enable it to eventually carry out cell line production itself. If these negotiations are unsuccessful  the Company's ability to change subcontractors within a reasonable time frame would be limited  and the Company would experience significant delays in the development of its cell line-based drug candidates.Finally  investors are invited to consider the following risks: (i) the market price of the Company's shares may fluctuate and fall below the price of the Fundraising and the Reserved Capital Increase  (ii) the volatility and liquidity of the Company's shares may fluctuate significantly  (iii) sales of the Company's shares may occur on the market and have a negative impact on the market price of the shares  and (iv) the Company's shareholders could suffer potentially significant dilution as a result of any future capital increases necessary to finance the Company. In this context  the Company reiterates the following risk factors from the Universal Registration Document: 2.2.2.1 ""Possible exhaustion of available funds "" 2.2.2.2 ""Expected increase in capital requirements "" 2.2.2.3 ""Uncertain realization of revenue from partnerships "" 2.2.2.4 ""Possible adverse effect of financing efforts on existing shareholders"" and 2.2.2.5 ""Increased liquidity and partnership structures.""In any event  it is recommended that you consult Section 2 ""Risk Factors"" of the Universal Registration Document for a detailed description of these risks.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In October  Volta Finance posted a net return of -0.6%  taking the year-to-date performance to +2.9%. For context  US High Yield bonds returned +7.3%*** and Euro High Yield bonds achieved +4.7% over the same period  while the Morningstar Leveraged Loan indices were up +4.9%*** in the US and +3.2% in Europe.Market activity this month was shaped by political events  central bank decisions and company earnings reports. Early optimism  driven by strong AI-related revenues and high valuations in the tech sector  quickly turned to volatility as renewed trade tensions emerged. The announcement of fresh tariffs triggered the sharpest single-day fall in the S&P 500 since April. With little economic data available due to the US government shutdown  investors looked to central banks for direction. The US Federal Reserve responded by cutting interest rates by 25 basis points  as widely expected. Meanwhile  US corporate earnings were strong  with around 85% of S&P 500 companies beating expectations  which helped fuel a late rally and push US equities to new record highs.In the credit markets  the Morningstar LSTA Leveraged Loan Indices recorded returns of +0.22% in the US*** and -0.27% in Europe. Both indices experienced some decline in price  but the high yields offered by these loans helped cushion the impact. CLOs saw spreads stabilise for senior and investment grade tranches  with AAA-rated CLOs trading around 120 basis points in the US and 130 basis points in Europe. However  deeper mezzanine tranches  particularly BB-rated CLOs  saw spreads widen modestly  especially in Europe  where levels moved towards 575 basis points depending on the deal. In the CLO Equity market  negative headlines—such as concerns around First Brands—and tighter spreads in the underlying loan portfolios (with compression of 10–30 basis points in Europe and 30–40 basis points in the US for CLOs in their reinvestment periods) led to softer prices in secondary trading.During the month  Volta invested c. EUR 5m into 6 unique trades focusing on BB-rated and single-B rated tranches of European CLOs. BBs were sourced in the +560bps context while single-Bs were sourced in the +850bps context  i.e slightly wider than September prints for similar risk profiles. The company’s cash position consequently continued to decrease and moved sub 16% while the cash-flow generation reached c. EUR 26m equivalent  or 20% of October’s NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of performance breakdown  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -1.9%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +0.1% performance**. The EUR/USD move from 1.1757 to 1.1537 had a +0.3% positive impact on Volta performance given the long dollar exposure (13%).As of end of October 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €265.3m  i.e. €7.25 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.17% of Volta’s NAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes.

The European Commission has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and above with inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH) and who are naive to anti- immunoglobulin-E (IgE) therapy for CSU. Eligible patients can use Dupixent as a first-line targeted treatment option.“The unpredictable nature of chronic spontaneous urticaria leaves patients guessing when they’ll have their next outbreak of disruptive  debilitating hives and itch  which can make life challenging ” said Tonya Winders  President & CEO  Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform. “Dupixent is proven to reduce these intense symptoms and has the potential to make a positive impact on people struggling to control this disease.”“Standard-of-care  first-line treatment options like antihistamines offer limited relief for many people living with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria  leaving them to face unrelenting cycles of itch and hives ” said Alyssa Johnsen  MD  PhD  Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology Development at Sanofi. “Dupixent significantly reduced these symptoms of CSU and led to more patients experiencing well-controlled disease or a complete response compared to placebo in two phase 3 studies. Now  eligible patients with CSU in the EU have a new option that is proven to reduce itch and hives.”The approval is based on data from two phase 3 clinical studies in the LIBERTY-CUPID program (NCT04180488). Study A and Study C included 284 patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and who were naïve to anti-IgE therapy. Both studies assessed Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone and demonstrated Dupixent significantly reduced urticaria activity (a composite of itch and hives)  and individual measures of itch and hive severity compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Dupixent also increased the percentage of patients with well-controlled disease and complete response at 24 weeks compared to placebo. Study B (n=108) provided additional safety data and evaluated Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy and symptomatic despite antihistamine use.Safety results from Study A  Study B and Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse reactions for Dupixent overall are injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes  and eosinophilia. Additional adverse reactions of injection site induration  injection site dermatitis  and injection site hematoma were reported in the CSU adult and adolescent studies. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) than placebo in patients with CSU were injection site reaction  COVID-19  hypertension  CSU  and accidental overdose.“The approval of Dupixent for certain adults and adolescents with chronic spontaneous urticaria in the European Union represents the first innovation for patients with this disease in over a decade ” said George D. Yancopoulos  MD  PhD  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Physicians now have a new approach for CSU with Dupixent  as the only treatment that inhibits IL4 and IL13  two key drivers of type 2 inflammation  and can offer patients significant improvement in debilitating itch and hives. This approval further demonstrates the ability of Dupixent to advance the treatment landscape for yet another chronic type 2 inflammatory disease  with a well-established safety profile across its indications.”Beyond the EU  Dupixent is also approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several countries including the US and Japan.About CSUCSU is a chronic  inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1AH  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite H1AH treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 270 000 people in the EU aged 12 years and older suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About the Dupixent CSU phase 3 study programThe LIBERTY-CUPID phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B  and Study C. These studies were randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone. Studies A and C were replicate studies that assessed patients aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and were naïve to anti-IgE therapy. Study B was conducted in patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite use of antihistamines and were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy. During the 24-week treatment period in all three studies  all patients received an initial loading dose followed by either 300 mg Dupixent every two weeks  or 200 mg every two weeks for adolescents weighing <60 kg.The primary endpoint in all three studies assessed the change from baseline in itch and hives (weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale). The key secondary endpoint (also assessed at 24 weeks) was change from baseline in itch (measured by the weekly itch severity score  0-21 scale). Additional secondary endpoints assessed at 24 weeks evaluated:Change from baseline in hives (measured by the weekly hive severity score  0-21 scale)Proportion of patients achieving well-controlled disease status (UAS7 ≤6)Proportion of patients with complete response (UAS7=0).The results from Studies A and B were published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In adults with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1AH treatment  Dupixent 300 mg is administered every two weeks after an initial loading dose. In patients aged 12 to 17 years with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1AH treatment  Dupixent is administered every two weeks based on weight (200 mg for adolescents ≥30 to <60 kg  300 mg for adolescents ≥60 kg) after an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home after training by a healthcare professional. In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and bullous pemphigoid in different age populations. More than 1.3 million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  lichen simplex chronicus  and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and above with inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH) and who are naïve to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy for CSU. Eligible patients can use Dupixent as a first-line targeted treatment option.“The unpredictable nature of chronic spontaneous urticaria leaves patients guessing when they’ll have their next outbreak of disruptive  debilitating hives and itch  which can make life challenging ” said Tonya Winders  President & CEO  Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform. “Dupixent is proven to reduce these intense symptoms and has the potential to make a positive impact on people struggling to control this disease.”“The approval of Dupixent for certain adults and adolescents with chronic spontaneous urticaria in the European Union represents the first innovation for patients with this disease in over a decade ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Physicians now have a new approach for CSU with Dupixent  as the only treatment that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13  two key drivers of type 2 inflammation  and can offer patients significant improvement in debilitating itch and hives. This approval further demonstrates the ability of Dupixent to advance the treatment landscape for yet another chronic type 2 inflammatory disease  with a well-established safety profile across its indications.”The approval is based on data from two Phase 3 clinical trials in the LIBERTY-CUPID program. Study A and Study C included 284 patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and who were naïve to anti-IgE therapy. Both trials assessed Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone and demonstrated Dupixent significantly reduced urticaria activity (a composite of itch and hives)  and individual measures of itch and hive severity compared to placebo at 24 weeks. Dupixent also increased the percentage of patients with well-controlled disease and complete response at 24 weeks compared to placebo. Study B included 108 patients and provided additional safety data and evaluated Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older who were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy and symptomatic despite antihistamine use.Safety results from Study A  Study B and Study C were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse reactions for Dupixent overall are injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Additional adverse reactions of injection site induration  injection site dermatitis and injection site hematoma were reported in the CSU adult and adolescent trials. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) than placebo in patients with CSU were injection site reaction  COVID-19  hypertension  CSU and accidental overdose.“Standard-of-care  first-line treatment options like antihistamines offer limited relief for many people living with uncontrolled chronic spontaneous urticaria  leaving them to face unrelenting cycles of itch and hives ” said Alyssa Johnsen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Global Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology Development at Sanofi. “Dupixent significantly reduced these symptoms of CSU and led to more patients experiencing well-controlled disease or a complete response compared to placebo in two Phase 3 studies. Now  eligible patients with CSU in the EU have a new option that is proven to reduce itch and hives.”Beyond the European Union (EU)  Dupixent is also approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several countries including the United States and Japan.About CSUCSU is a chronic  inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1AH  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite H1AH treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 270 000 people in the EU aged 12 years and older suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.About the Dupixent CSU Phase 3 Trial ProgramThe LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A  Study B and Study C. These trials were randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone. Studies A and C were replicate trials that assessed patients aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite the use of antihistamines and were naïve to anti-IgE therapy. Study B was conducted in patients aged 12 years and older who were symptomatic despite use of antihistamines and were inadequate responders or intolerant to anti-IgE therapy. During the 24-week treatment period in all three trials  all patients received an initial loading dose followed by either 300 mg Dupixent every two weeks or 200 mg every two weeks for adolescents weighing <60 kg.The primary endpoint in all three studies assessed the change from baseline in itch and hives (weekly urticaria activity score [UAS7]  0-42 scale). The key secondary endpoint (also assessed at 24 weeks) was change from baseline in itch (measured by the weekly itch severity score [ISS7]  0-21 scale). Additional secondary endpoints assessed at 24 weeks evaluated:Change from baseline in hives (measured by the weekly hive severity score [HSS7]  0-21 scale)Proportion of patients achieving well-controlled disease status (UAS7 ≤6)Proportion of patients with complete response (UAS7=0).The results from Studies A and B were published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In adults with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1AH treatment  Dupixent 300 mg is administered every two weeks after an initial loading dose. In patients aged 12 to 17 years with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1AH treatment  Dupixent is administered every two weeks based on weight (200 mg for adolescents ≥30 to <60 kg  300 mg for adolescents ≥60 kg) after an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home after training by a healthcare professional. In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) in different age populations. More than 1 300 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  lichen simplex chronicus and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The product of hard and methodical work by many journalists and technicians throughout the weekend. Heaven forbid we didn’t honor the man who—being carried away  according to his own words  by Mitsotakis—also honored us in the fury of his five-year term. But that’s all in the past; we recorded his version and of course… as if we wouldn’t. As we predicted yesterday  Ithaca has been read like crazy  is selling like crazy  and is lighting fires  as the folk song says.Do’s and Don’tsI’m writing impressions from the streets  political and journalistic  freely  from the book. First of all  as I told you  a general impression was that Tsipras in his book does not apologize  nor does he regret anything he himself did  not a single apology in 700 pages  says spokesperson Marinakis. But of course  I find Adonis’ brief comment spot-on: “he comes to tell us that the people he chose are useless and he wants to become prime minister again.” I wasn’t surprised that Varoufakis contradicts him and that Zoitsa and Lafazanis insult him. But I was surprised that Othonas calls him a liar  saying he offered the late Fofi to participate in the government. I was surprised that he expects us to believe that Kammenos became his co-governor and minister twice because the first time he went up to Koumoundourou by elevator and managed to get there before Theodorakis who went on foot  and the second time Panos-Zervas managed to climb onto the Zappeion stage and raise his hands first (who can forget the sweaty armpits…) with Alexis-Velouchiotis. I was also surprised at how he recounts that on that fateful morning wake-up at 6 a.m. in Mati  there was a raging west wind blowing. Incidentally  I was told that Mitsotakis himself commented on this  because that morning he was returning from Tinos with a rigid inflatable boat “and it was absolutely calm.” I was not at all surprised that in his book he praises Dora  in contrast to Kyriakos whom he blames for everything. Well  come on  it’s obvious why: the man has an issue with the person who beat him so many times. I was also not surprised by Polakis’ response because I believe Polakis is extremely consistent in his positions—he has always been like that. I’ll finish  for now  with how I wasn’t surprised about Alexis’ catfight with Kasselakis and vice versa  with the incident at his house and the Betty–Tayler dialogue  because when it comes to… family meltdowns  leftists are specialists.Media reactionsNow  as you understand  the first thing I did yesterday was call Tsipras’ opponents and ask what’s going on. I’m not exaggerating  but honestly  they—led by K.M.—couldn’t hide their joy; they’re saying here we are  Alexis is back  exactly the same as we knew him and loved him.In memory of Vardis I. VardinogiannisThis time last year  the great Greek businessman Vardis I. Vardinogiannis passed away. Today his family is organizing a memorial event in honor of its Patriarch  attended by personalities and friends from across the political  business  and social spectrum of the country. The prime minister will also attend.Mitsotakis–TasoulasLet me tell you two behind-the-scenes details from yesterday’s private meeting between K.M. and Tasoulas. I’m told they did not discuss at all the issue of whether the President should intervene or not  and it is officially communicated that the matter is considered closed. Besides  K.M. never conveyed any annoyance  not even in his private communications with the President. Otherwise  as soon as the cameras left  the conversation focused on Epirus. K.M. wanted to know what the local officials are saying and which villages were most affected by the rainfall.VDL in AthensWe’ll have high-profile arrivals at the end of the week in our parts  as I hear that the president of the Commission  VDL  is coming for some inauguration and of course she will also meet with K.M. Notably  with the schedule and the chaos of these days regarding Ukraine  I understand that the schedules of all leaders are volatile. Anyway  everyone is waiting to see whether white smoke will appear.Kotsovolos preparing acquisitionsWe move on to news from the market  with Kotsovolos which  according to information  is moving toward acquiring its competitors at the local level in order to obtain larger market shares and give some tone of growth to the difficult home-appliance market. According to the same sources  Kotsovolos is planning a series of acquisitions of competitors at the local level  as we said—that is  to buy electrical-goods chains in significant provincial cities. The plan will shake up the market  but the difficulty Kotsovolos must overcome is the Competition Commission  since these acquisitions may create local monopolies  given the strong market shares Kotsovolos already holds.E. Vrettou: We’re looking at insurance companies  mutual funds  brokerage firms  tech companiesAnd since we started with acquisitions  let’s continue in the same vein with Credia Bank. “We clearly want to grow our size even more  and I think we’re proving that by finding smart acquisitions. I consider the acquisition in Malta extremely smart and not just financially.” So said yesterday at the Fortune conference  the CEO of Credia Bank  Eleni Vrettou  who continued by talking about the bank’s interest in acquisitions: “On the other hand  what we need to strengthen are things like fee income. So I made it clear that anything that can give us more fees. Obviously in areas like insurance—that is  bancassurance—mutual funds  brokerage  everything  that whole field. But also perhaps outside of that field we may find smart digital applications  not always with a small share  but something that could give us a truly digital  technological product that differentiates us from the competition.”DIAS and the abolition of ATM feesAt the same conference  DIAS CEO St. Kampouridou said that this year the flow of money through DIAS reaches 560 billion. Of that  15 billion occurred through IRIS  which has reached 4.2 million users and is generally growing at impressive rates. I wonder if the explosion of transactions via DIAS is due to the abolition of ATM fees that the government imposed on the banks.The Hellenic Capital Market Commission among Euronext supervisorsThe market is beginning to operate in Euronext mode. The chair of the Hellenic Capital Market Commission  Vasiliki Lazarakou  was invited on Thursday 27/11 to participate in the meeting of the College of Supervisors. This body consists of the heads of the corresponding supervisory authorities in the now eight stock exchanges that make up Euronext. The College of Supervisors meets regularly to coordinate supervisory authorities.Capital increase of 9.5 million at REGENCYAt “REGENCY Entertainment Leisure and Tourism ” by decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders held on October 31  2025  it was decided to increase the company’s share capital through cash payments by the amount of nine million five hundred fifty-five thousand euros (€9 555 000.00) with the issuance of thirty-one million eight hundred fifty thousand (31 850 000) common registered voting shares  each of a nominal value of thirty euro cents (€0.30). Thus  today the company’s total share capital equals ten million five hundred fifty-five thousand euros and twenty euro cents (€10 555 000.20) and is divided into thirty-five million one hundred eighty-three thousand three hundred thirty-four (35 183 334) common registered voting shares of nominal value thirty euro cents (€0.30).The…reassignments of “Helios”Three interesting decisions concerning reassignment of claims between companies of the tourism group “Helios ” owned by the Mantzounanakis family  were made by the General Assembly of shareholders. Specifically  in the “extraordinary  spontaneous  and universal” General Assembly of “Helios” held on October 8  2025  it was decided to draft a claim reassignment contract “by which Helios is reassigned from the company ‘Kritikes Diakopes S.A. ’ in which it holds the majority of the share capital  a) a claim of 5% of the principal and interest from Arbitration Decision 1/2020 against ETAD S.A.  which it had assigned as security under the contract dated 30.09.2022  b) a claim of €2 000 000 of the principal from Arbitration Decision 2/2020 against ETAD S.A.  which it had assigned as security under the assignment contract dated 05.01.2023. These claims are part of the 95% portion that has been assigned as security from ‘Attikos Helios’ (which manages Grand Resort Lagonissi) to ‘Helios ’ under the private security-assignment agreement of 28.11.2019.” Similarly  it was decided to draft a contract by which it is reassigned  from the company “Kritikos Helios S.A.” where “Helios” holds 97.53% of the share capital  a) a claim of 15% of the principal and interest from Arbitration Decision 24/2019 against ETAD S.A.  which had been assigned as security under the contract dated 30.09.2022  b) a claim of €2 000 000 of the principal from Arbitration Decision 2/2020 against ETAD S.A.  which had been assigned as security under the contract dated 12.01.2023. The reassigned claims are part of the 97.53% portion that has been assigned as security from “Attikos Helios” to “Helios ” under the same agreement. From the same General Assembly  it was also decided to draft a similar contract “by which it is reassigned from the company ‘Argolikos Helios’ (which manages the group’s hotels in Nafplio)  a claim of €300 000 from the awarded claims in favor of ‘Attikos Helios’ under the principal of Arbitration Decision 2/2020 against ETAD S.A.  the reassigned amount being part of the 95% portion that has been assigned as security from ‘Attikos Helios’ to ‘Helios ’ under the same (28.11.2019) private security-assignment agreement.” In other words  Pantelis Mantzounakis… is gathering at the parent company the claims pursued against ETAD which had been assigned to the subsidiaries…Tsakos is building 20 new shipsIn a year when tariffs  geopolitical tensions  and the uncertainties of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have confused even the toughest Wall Street traders  Tsakos Energy Navigation seems to be enjoying the… swell. The analysts in New York  who have now learned to look at shipping companies the way they look at tech stocks  note that TEN of Nikos Tsakos is playing on another level. While other shipowners are trying to see what the market will do “after the next crisis ” TEN is literally building  with 20 new ships under construction and a fleet worth over $6 billion. And it’s not only the size that impresses market observers. It’s also that the oil majors seem to be lining up for long-term contracts. As George Saroglou  president and COO  says  TEN “is increasing its critical mass ” leaving behind its “first-generation” vessels and setting course for a more stable and predictable profitability.Oikonomou  Fragkou  and the Stock Market ActivistsIn the world of shipping  where decisions are often made behind closed doors and interests are intertwined  the topic of shareholder activism returns to the forefront  this time featuring Giorgos Oikonomou. The experienced shipowner mentioned that Navios Partners  led by Angeliki Fragkou  could become the target of a future activist campaign. Of course  he clarified that he “does not have the time” to play the role of activist himself. A statement that sounds more like “don’t look at me  look around” than genuine distancing. In the international market  they now speak of two types of activism. The “big A” activism  which shakes up boards of directors and turns strategies upside down. And the “little a ” milder  which doesn’t shout but hints and sends messages. The new trend analysts are observing is the following: more and more shipowners are buying equity positions in their listed competitors. Officially  for investment reasons. Unofficially  however  discussions in brokerage offices are heating up: Are these positions neither passive nor activist? Could they be a prelude to acquisitions? History has shown that in shipping  the biggest deals start quietly  with a small equity stake that gradually turns into control. Investors building positions in listed shipping companies may see a purely investment opportunity  want to push for management changes  hope for a “greenmail” payout—that is  payment to… step aside—or lay the groundwork for a future acquisition. In practice  no one knows the real intention until the move everyone expected or feared actually happens. And thus  shareholder activism in shipping may not have the intensity of Wall Street  but it moves at its own pace: slowly  steadily  and with a destination often revealed when it’s too late for the rest.Valentios Valentis Buys 3 ShipsIn a time when Wall Street applauds anything that moves  and even more anything that floats  Valentios Valentis decided that the markets are treating him unfairly. A classic shipowner complaint  one might say  except here there’s a twist: instead of complaining  he initiates purchases of ships and shares. A double bet  a double message. With liquidity reaching $114 million  Pyxis is preparing to acquire three new ships  while simultaneously putting $3 million on the table for a buyback because  as the shipowner says  “the stock does not reflect its true value.” On Wall Street  this translates as: if you don’t lift us  we’ll lift ourselves. And while daily freight rates have dipped slightly  the CEO sees “positive surprises” on the horizon. He speculates that trade flows could turn again in ways that ultimately benefit carriers. In short  Pyxis is doing what Wall Street analysts love: buying at market lows  selling at the ceiling.What Pier Saw in German Energy PricesYesterday  while Finance Minister Pierrakakis was visiting Berlin to meet his counterparts  the cost of electricity in Germany had skyrocketed to €132 per megawatt-hour—triple that of Spain (with abundant solar energy and interconnections with North Africa) and 75% higher than France (abundant  cheap nuclear energy). After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  the Germans decided on the “Energiewende ” i.e.  the transition to renewable energy sources  reducing dependence on Russian natural gas  while also deciding to close nuclear power plants. The consequences for German industry were and remain disastrous. Chemical giants like BASF are relocating production to China and the U.S. Steelworks are closing. The energy-intensive automotive industry is bleeding as it loses competitiveness against Chinese and American producers enjoying cheap energy. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that he has reached an agreement with other leaders of the governing coalition to introduce an electricity price of about five euro cents per kilowatt-hour from January 1  2026  until 2028  in order to “support companies that use a lot of electricity and face international competition.” He said that relevant discussions with the European Commission for approval have “largely been completed” and that the measure will target large energy-intensive industries. In Greece  the wholesale electricity price remains above €150/MWh. This means that for medium industrial consumers  the cost was €0.13/kWh (130 €/MWh) in December 2024. Italy has received European Commission approval to implement a “special electricity tariff” for industry but has not yet applied it. In Greece  a new pricing framework similar to Italy’s has been announced  but we are still waiting for specific announcements.Stock Market: Trading Value Did Not Reach €1 BillionWith Wall Street counting down the hours until the “sacred” Thanksgiving holidays  the rest of the world counting the last bombs before the Russia-Ukraine treaty is signed  and foreign institutional investors closing their books for this year in Athens  interest in yesterday’s trading activity on the Stock Exchange was limited to the MSCI Index restructuring. During the regular session  trading value was €161.8 million  with €12.2 million in blocks. After the auction process ended  trading value jumped to €875.18 million  with €482.8 million (55% of turnover) related to Metlen stock (-1.21% at €42.28). Such high trading activity had not been seen on Athens Avenue since November 28  2024  when trades reached €1.72 billion due to the acquisition of TERNA Energy by Masdar. The rebalancing of the MSCI Standard Index benefited Cenergy  which rose (+0.92%) to €15.40 with a trading value of €38.8 million. The General Index moved between 2 078.68 (+0.82%) and 2 056.73 points (-0.24%)  finally closing at 2 065.42 points (+0.18%). The positive sign of the General Index was supported by Coca-Cola (+1.55%) at €41.96 and OTE (+0.47%) at €17.28  while banks remained steady to indifferent. Major support came from Aegean (+2.96%) at €13.90 and TITAN (+2.18%) at €44.50.In the UK  They Discuss Raising the “Most Hated Tax”The serious problems with the UK Labour government’s budget deficits are well known. That is why they are even discussing a “special tax on the wealthy.” However  the “most hated tax” in the UK is the Inheritance Tax. It is even more unpopular than VAT. Established in 2009  it had a maximum tax-free threshold of £325 000. Since then  over the past 15 years  property prices have skyrocketed  inflation has soared  but the threshold stubbornly remains at £325 000. According to the British press  Rachel Reeves  the Finance Minister  in the budget she will present tomorrow  has included a plan—not to increase but to reduce the tax-free threshold for Inheritance Tax. In 2009  revenue from Inheritance Tax was approximately £2 billion. Now it exceeds £14 billion.
