The European Commission is trying to get EU countries to use the Russian Central Bank's assets to finance Ukraine's war effort. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around 140 billion euros ($162 billion) in Russian money could be used as a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine would only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage"" from Russia. Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros. Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly in Euroclear  a Belgium-based securities depository.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251124/us-ukraine-plan-under-revision-fewer-points-no-frozen-asset-confiscation-1123166639.htmlbelgiumrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaltop eu diplomat  frozen russian assets  kaja kallas  eu foreign policy",neutral,0.01,0.67,0.32,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Top EU Diplomat', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Belgium', 'Concerns', 'Use', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'belgium russia ukraine european union', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Top EU Diplomat', 'Belgium-based securities depository', 'Russian Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Russian state assets', 'Belgian news agency', 'EU countries', 'European accounts', 'Russian money', 'Sputnik International', 'reparations loan', 'asset seizure', 'asset freeze', 'war effort', '140 billion euros', 'material damage', 'legal consequences', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'sputnikglobe', 'diplomat-calls', 'belgiums', 'concerns', 'use', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'Wednesday', 'world', 'cdn1.', 'interest', 'discussions', 'worries', 'everybody', 'table', 'risks', 'reporters', 'November', 'Belga', 'compensation', 'plan', 'fears', 'start', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'revision', 'fewer-points', 'frozen-asset-confiscation', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-11-26,2025-11-27,sputnikglobe.com

Read full story,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union has accelerated efforts to agree on a scheme to use frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine after a U.S.-backed peace plan last week set out different ideas  EU officials said.EU leaders tried at a summit last month to agree on a plan to use 140 billion euros ($162 billion) infrozen Russian sovereign assets in Europe as a loan for Kyiv  but failed to secure the backing of Belgium  where much of the funds are held.The European Commission  the EU executive body  hopes to address Belgium's concerns in a draft legal proposal which it will present this week on using the frozen sovereign assets to support Kyiv in 2026 and 2027  EU officials said.Work on the EU plan was already under way but details that emerged last week of how the assets might be used under the U.S.-backed plan  which European leaders saw as heavily favouring Moscow  have helped focus minds in the 27-nation bloc.""It surely made work on this even more urgent "" one official with knowledge of preparations for the project said.EU MUST HELP UKRAINE DEFEND ITSELF  VON DER LEYEN SAYSUnder the EU plan  which has been discussed since October  the frozen Russian central bank assets in Europe would be lent to Ukraine for Kyiv to use for defence and regular budget needs.This would provide welcome respite for EU governments  the biggest donors to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine would pay back the 140-billion-euro loan only when it receives war reparations from Russia.The latest version of the U.S.-backed plan has not been released.But under the U.S.-backed plan that was presented last week  $100 billion of the frozen Russian funds would be invested in a U.S.-led effort to reconstruct and invest in Ukraine  with the U.S. getting 50% of the profits from this venture  according to details of the 28-point plan that were made public.Under that plan  Europe would have to match the $100-billion contribution to increase the investment available to rebuild Ukraine while the balance of the frozen funds would be invested in a separate U.S.-Russia investment vehicle to pursue joint U.S.-Russia projects.The Commission's draft legal text is intended to help win the support of Belgium  where 185 billion euros of the 210 billion euros of assets frozen in Europe are located  because it would have to address in detail various legal guarantees that the Belgian government has demanded.""We need to support Ukraine to defend itself. We committed ourselves to cover Ukraine's financial needs in 2026 and 2027. This includes an option on immobilised Russian assets "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday.""The next step now is that the Commission is ready to present a legal text and  to be very clear  I cannot see any scenario in which the European taxpayer alone will pay the bill.""WHY IS AGREEMENT SO HARD?Among Belgium's main concerns  which have to be addressed before EU leaders discuss the plan again on December 18  is the issue of potential Russian lawsuits against the Belgian securities depository Euroclear  where the assets are kept.Such lawsuits could be costly  long-lasting or even launched years from now. The Belgian government wants other EU countries to guarantee it would not be left alone to cover the expense and financial fallout.Similarly  should courts ever decide that Russia must get its frozen money back before Moscow pays reparations to Kyiv  Belgium wants others to guarantee they would help provide the money - and quickly.While the Russian money remains frozen under a decision by EU leaders until Russia pays reparations  this decision needs to be renewed by unanimity every six months.This creates a risk that Hungary  whose prime minister is closer to Moscow than other EU leaders  might refuse to roll over the sanctions and in this way automatically release the funds to Moscow.Belgium and other EU governments want the Commission to come up with a way to prevent that before they approve the scheme.Apart from the 185 billion euros immobilised in Belgium  there is an estimated 25 billion euros more of Russian sovereign money frozen in EU banks in various countries  mainly in France and Luxembourg.Belgium says other countries that have Russian cash  including Canada  Japan  Britain and the U.S. - all of which are members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations - should also be included in the scheme.EU officials close to the talks between the Commission and Belgium are confident that all these concerns can be addressed one by one.""But ultimately  it will be about political will "" the EU official close to the talks said.($1 = 0.8639 euros)(Reporting by Jan Strupczewski  Editing by Timothy Heritage)",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.2,0.21,0.59,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'other ideas', 'EU', 'agreement', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'separate U.S.-Russia investment vehicle', 'joint U.S.-Russia projects', 'U.S.-backed peace plan', 'U.S.-led effort', 'U.S.-backed plan', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Seven wealthy nations', 'The European Union', 'draft legal proposal', 'regular budget needs', 'Belgian securities depository', 'The European Commission', 'draft legal text', 'various legal guarantees', 'EU executive body', 'potential Russian lawsuits', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen sovereign assets', 'Russian sovereign money', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other EU governments', 'other EU countries', 'other EU leaders', 'LEYEN SAYS', 'European leaders', 'The Commission', 'European Parliament', 'European taxpayer', 'other countries', 'various countries', 'EU plan', 'frozen money', 'Russian money', 'Russian cash', '28-point plan', 'financial needs', 'Such lawsuits', 'Belgian government', 'EU officials', 'EU banks', 'different ideas', '27-nation bloc', 'one official', 'welcome respite', 'biggest donors', 'full-scale invasion', 'latest version', '$100-billion contribution', 'next step', 'financial fallout', 'prime minister', 'political will', 'Jan Strupczewski', 'Timothy Heritage', 'Russian funds', '140 billion euros', '185 billion euros', '210 billion euros', '25 billion euros', '140-billion-euro loan', 'war reparations', 'main concerns', '0.8639 euros', 'BRUSSELS', 'Reuters', 'efforts', 'scheme', 'Ukraine', 'summit', 'Kyiv', 'backing', 'Belgium', 'Work', 'way', 'details', 'Moscow', 'focus', 'minds', 'knowledge', 'preparations', 'October', 'defence', 'February', 'profits', 'venture', 'balance', 'support', 'option', 'Wednesday', 'scenario', 'AGREEMENT', 'December', 'issue', 'Euroclear', 'expense', 'courts', 'others', 'decision', 'unanimity', 'risk', 'Hungary', 'sanctions', 'France', 'Luxembourg', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Britain', 'members', 'Group', 'talks']",2025-11-26,2025-11-27,thestar.com.my
53905,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://cointelegraph.com/news/deutsche-borse-allunity-eurau-stablecoin-integration-mica,Deutsche Börse locks in third euro stablecoin amid broader EU adoption,By integrating AllUnity’s EURAU — its third euro-denominated stablecoin — Deutsche Börse is making a clear move toward full-scale stablecoin adoption across its platform.,Market infrastructure provider Deutsche Börse plans to integrate the EURAU euro-pegged stablecoin issued by AllUnity  expanding the exchange group’s digital-asset strategy following earlier ties with Circle’s Euro Coin (EURC) and Societe Generale-Forge’s EUR CoinVertible (EURCV).According to a Wednesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph  Deutsche Börse plans to integrate EURAU into its financial market infrastructure  starting with institutional custody through its central securities depository arm  Clearstream. The announcement also promised a future “integration of the euro stablecoin across the entire service portfolio.”This would integrate the stablecoin into a sizable and growing market. According to World Federation of Exchanges data  Deutsche Börse’s domestic equity market capitalization is about $2.23 trillion with 474 listed companies.The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding  but have not yet shared a specific date for when the new features will go live. AllUnity CEO Alexander Höptner said that the partnership is “making onchain cross-border payments and digital assets accessible to institutional market participants.”Deutsche Börse Group executive board member Stephanie Eckermann said the “goal is to build a seamless bridge between the established financial world and the future of digital assets.” She added that this partnership is an important part of the effort and that embedding institutional-grade stablecoins allows clients “to confidently explore new possibilities in digital finance.”Deutsche Börse headquarters. Source: WikimediaDeutsche Börse and AllUnity had not responded to Cointelegraph’s inquiry by time of publication.Related: Stablecoin panic could upend ECB policy  Dutch central bank governor warnsDeutsche Börse expands euro stablecoin strategyDeutsche Börse’s EURAU integration follows its partnership with major stablecoin issuer Circle to adopt its EURC token in late September. Earlier this month  the company also announced that it had partnered with Societe Generale-Forge to integrate its EURCV stablecoin.With this latest deal  Deutsche Börse appears to be playing the stablecoin game on all fronts  adding EURAU  issued by a German BaFin-licensed e-money institution. This complements EURCV  a bank-tied stablecoin  as Societe Generale-Forge is the blockchain arm of major French multinational bank Societe Generale; EURC comes from a US tech-sector issuer.Related: Aave to offer zero-fee stablecoin ramps in Europe after MiCA approvalEU stablecoin adoption is taking shape with MiCAWhile not leading to as many headlines as the United States  the European Union is also making progress in stablecoin adoption following the full introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework at the end of 2024. The announcement noted that the partnership “aligns with MiCA” and “represents a tangible step toward digitizing European markets and enhancing settlement and liquidity processes.”Höptner said  “Europe is taking a global lead in regulated digital finance.”Still  while picking up speed  stablecoin adoption remains low in Europe. Earlier this month  financial stability experts at the European Central Bank (ECB) said stablecoin-related risks in the euro area were limited due to low adoption and preventative regulation.Some analyses point to euro stablecoins as a response to concerns that US dollar-backed stablecoins could threaten the European Union’s monetary independence. “Europe should not be dependent on US dollar-denominated stablecoins  which are currently dominating markets ” Pierre Gramegna  the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism  said earlier this month.The industry is also seeing increasing involvement by local traditional financial players. In mid-October  Franco-German banking group ODDO BHF launched a stablecoin pegged to the euro under the MiCA framework.In late September  a group of major European banks joined forces to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin under MiCA.

The results showed strong anamne…,Antibody levels remained well above baseline across all six serotypes and age groups sixth month after third yearly booster doseNo safety concerns observed in any age group by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)Results confirm benefits of a yearly vaccination prior to each Lyme seasonSaint-Herblain (France)  November 26  2025 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced positive final immunogenicity and safety data from Phase 2 study  VLA15-221  of Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. The results showed strong anamnestic immune response and favorable safety profile six months after a third booster dose (month 48) in all age groups  confirming compatibility with the anticipated benefits of a yearly vaccination prior to each Lyme season. Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 for the development and commercialization of VLA15 by Pfizer.There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 has advanced the furthest in clinical development  with all vaccinations completed in the pivotal VALOR Phase 3 trial1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year2  and 132 000 cases are reported annually in Europe3. Subject to positive Phase 3 data  Pfizer aims to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “These final Phase 2 data are consistent with those reported previously4 5 and confirm the potential benefits of booster doses across all evaluated age groups. Lyme disease continues to expand geographically and remains a pressing unmet medical need affecting communities across the Northern Hemisphere. Each set of positive results moves us closer to the possibility of making this vaccine available to adults  adolescents and children living in Lyme-endemic areas.”As observed in previous VLA15 clinical studies  an additional dose immediately boosted the antibody levels which then undergo a gradual decline over time but remained well above baseline in all study groups  confirming their persistence at month 48  six months after vaccination at month 42. The study compared two dosing schedules and overall  antibody levels remained higher with the three-dose primary vaccination schedule compared to the two-dose schedule. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) compared to baseline ranged from 9.5-fold for Serotype 1 (ST1) to 15.6-fold for Serotype 2 (ST2) across all age groups in the three-dose Month 0-2-6 primary vaccination schedule. The highest GMFRs were reported in the 5 to 11 years old age group  with GMFR levels ranging from 15.5-fold (ST1) to 28.5-fold (ST2).These results further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule and a yearly booster dose  already included in the Phase 3 protocols.The safety and tolerability profile of VLA15 six months after the third booster dose was similar to the profile observed after previous booster doses. No safety concerns were observed by the independent DMC in any vaccination or age group.About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 was a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It was the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). 560 healthy participants received either VLA15 in two immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=181]) or placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=189]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout (primary endpoint) was performed one month after completion of the primary series vaccination schedule. All eligible subjects received yearly booster doses of VLA15 or placebo at Months 18  30 and 42. Antibody persistence was followed up to six months post third annual booster. VLA15 was tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study was conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and enrolled both volunteers with a prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks6. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere7 8. While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated each year and 132 000 cases are reported annually in Europe. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint paints) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system9 10. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens11.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

53913,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/11/26/wind-auction-may-tell-us-if-john-collison-is-right-about-our-inability-to-get-things-done/,What the wind auction result can tell us about John Collison’s criticism of our ability to get things done,Any increase over the average guaranteed price paid in 2023 can be seen as some sort of ‘Irish difficulty premium’,Last Friday  an 8 500-word take down of John Collison‘s recent Irish Times opinion piece bemoaning the inability of the State to get things done was published on the UCD Environmental Law and Justice Group blog.The author – assistant professor in planning and environmental law at UCD Andrew Jackson – was clearly in no mood to grant Collison any poetic licence and contradicted numerous examples given by Collison of how Ireland is in effect getting in its own way.[ John Collison of Stripe: Ireland is going backwards. Here’s how to get it movingOpens in new window ]He starts with figures showing how the Department of Housing has not in fact “decided to intentionally depopulate the east of the country” and ends with a rebuttal of the assertion that “uniquely in developed countries  our system makes it easy for [Nimbys] by giving anyone legal standing to object to development”.The fundamental point that Jackson seems to be making is that the various actions taken by State agencies or State-adjacent entities that Collison derides have a firm basis in Irish law  European law and Government policy. Many of them reflect the undeniable reality of climate change. As such  Jackson argues they reflect the values of contemporary Ireland as much if not more than the abundance agenda promoted by Collision and the think tank he funds  Progress Ireland.A relatively recent concept  abundance argues that less regulation and more technology will produce better returns for everybody than the current regulatory-heavy paradigm in which the State plays a big role.The depressing thing is that Collision and Jackson are both right and also wrong. The State has an important role in regulation  but enforcing regulations cannot be an end in itself. Equally depressing is that a much needed debate about this dilemma risks turning into some sort of US-style ideological battle.[ Micheál Martin bemoans planning issues to Stripe’s John CollisonOpens in new window ]Both Collison and Jackson have adopted equally scornful and dismissive tones. It’s a style very in keeping with what passes for public discourse on social media. The point that both seem to have missed is that if they really want to bring about change or defend something of value they must bring the other sides with them. Memes and zingers are not enough.The approach does not bode well for the prospect of either man helping square what is a very important circle: how to speed up the delivery of strategically important projects without losing sight of the wider issue such as democratic accountability and environmental protection.The issue will come into focus when the Government holds its second offshore wind energy auction. The winner of the Tonn Nua auction will get government support to build a 900MW wind farm off the south coast in the form of a guaranteed long-term price for the electricity generated by the project.The bidders put forward the guaranteed price they want and the lowest priced bid wins – provided it meets the other criteria. The price of the winning bid compared to the winning prices in previous auctions can be seen as a reflection on the global wind energy industry’s view of Ireland as a place to do business and get things done.How AI is beginning to wreak havoc in the jobs market Listen | 33:05 On this week’s episode of Inside Business  we look at the role of AI in the hiring and firing of workers.Host Ciarán Hancock is joined on the podcast by Ciara O’Brien of the Irish Times to discuss why Amazon recently announced 14 000 job cuts globally as it seeks to trim expenses. Is this being driven solely by AI? Well  in an update to staff in June  Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy stated the company would reduce jobs in some areas while it hired in others. And more AI would mean fewer corporate staff at Amazon  with the slack being picked up by generative AI and high-tech agents. Separately  we have new research from hiring platform Greenhouse which suggests that AI has created a ‘doom loop’ between applicants and those who are hiring. Irish Times Work Correspondent Emmet Malone explains the issue  along with the new phenomenon of fake job postings. Plus  Ciarán is joined in studio by Darryl Byrne  Chief Executive of Irish stock exchange operator Euronext Dublin  to discuss the future of the market here and a proposal he has put forward to introduce a future-focused SIA (Savings Investment Account).Produced by John Casey with JJ Vernon on sound.Of the four winners of the first offshore wind auction held in June 2023  one has abandoned its project and the other three are still embroiled in the planning process. In April  Corio Generation withdrew from a project to build a farm off the Sceirdre Rocks in Connemara that would have powered 350 000 homes. The reason was not disclosed  but sources cited engineering challenges.The other three projects are still in the planning process. The North Dublin Array – backed by Norway’s Statkraft – had planned to begin generation in 2030 based on a 12-month planning process. It is now 16 months into the process and does not expect to get planning until 2027 as the additional information requested will require years of further surveys and millions of euro of further investment  according to the companyDublin ArrayGerman energy giant RWE and Irish company Saorgus plan to build a wind farm on the Kish and Bray Banks to power 770 000 homes – known as Dublin Array. They submitted their planning application in February. It is also targeting 2030 for completion.The final project – the Codling Wind park backed by France’s EDF which could power a million homes – submitted its application in September 2024. An Coimisiún Pleanála has sought further information and it is also unlikely to meet its planning target.Frustrated though they may be  it is unlikely that the backers of these projects did not anticipate a lengthy planning process and factor it into their bids.The result of Tonn Nua auction are illuminating. The winners  ESB-Ørsted  bid €98.72 a mega watt hour (MW/h) - higher than the average of €86.05MW/h paid two years ago.Jackson camp – for want of a better word – can argue that the auction succeeded and thus  for all its flaws  our democratically accountable approach is functional.But the Collison camp will be able to argue that the increase over the average guaranteed price paid in 2023 represents some sort of “Irish difficulty premium” as global wind energy prices have remained relatively stable over the intervening years.The truth – as ever – lies somewhere in the middle. We must do things better and more efficiently  but do not need to throw the democratic baby out with the bath water. Hyperbole and sarcasm don’t really help.This article was amended to reflect the result of the Tonn Nua auction on November 26th  2025,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['wind auction result', 'John Collison', 'criticism', 'ability', 'things', 'Irish Times Work Correspondent Emmet Malone', 'second offshore wind energy auction', 'recent Irish Times opinion piece', 'Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy', 'global wind energy industry', 'first offshore wind auction', 'Irish stock exchange operator', 'Host Ciarán Hancock', 'The North Dublin Array', 'Tonn Nua auction', 'Justice Group blog', 'current regulatory-heavy paradigm', 'US-style ideological battle', 'Micheál Martin', '900MW wind farm', 'Ciara O’Brien', 'Savings Investment Account', 'lowest priced bid', 'fake job postings', 'fewer corporate staff', 'other three projects', 'UCD Environmental Law', 'UCD Andrew Jackson', '12-month planning process', 'Irish law', 'recent concept', 'Euronext Dublin', 'The State', 'important projects', 'winning bid', '14,000 job cuts', 'other sides', 'environmental protection', 'other criteria', 'European law', '8,500-word take', 'assistant professor', 'poetic licence', 'numerous examples', 'new window', 'developed countries', 'legal standing', 'various actions', 'State-adjacent entities', 'firm basis', 'undeniable reality', 'think tank', 'depressing thing', 'planning issues', 'John CollisonOpens', 'dismissive tones', 'public discourse', 'social media', 'important circle', 'democratic accountability', 'south coast', 'winning prices', 'previous auctions', 'high-tech agents', 'new research', 'doom loop', 'new phenomenon', 'Darryl Byrne', 'future-focused SIA', 'John Casey', 'JJ Vernon', 'four winners', 'Sceirdre Rocks', 'engineering challenges', 'Government policy', 'big role', 'important role', 'government support', 'long-term price', 'guaranteed price', 'fundamental point', 'State agencies', 'Collison derides', 'climate change', 'abundance agenda', 'less regulation', 'Inside Business', 'Corio Generation', 'contemporary Ireland', 'Progress Ireland', 'wider issue', 'generative AI', 'jobs market', 'inability', 'things', 'author', 'mood', 'effect', 'way', 'Stripe', 'figures', 'Department', 'Housing', 'fact', 'east', 'country', 'rebuttal', 'assertion', 'system', 'development', 'values', 'Collision', 'technology', 'returns', 'everybody', 'regulations', 'needed', 'debate', 'dilemma', 'sort', 'Both', 'scornful', 'something', 'Memes', 'zingers', 'approach', 'prospect', 'man', 'delivery', 'sight', 'form', 'electricity', 'bidders', 'reflection', 'view', 'place', 'havoc', 'week', 'episode', 'hiring', 'firing', 'workers', 'podcast', 'expenses', 'update', 'June', 'company', 'areas', 'others', 'slack', 'Greenhouse', 'applicants', 'studio', 'proposal', 'sound', 'April', 'Connemara', '350,000 homes', 'reason', 'sources', 'Statkraft', '16 months']",2025-11-26,2025-11-27,irishtimes.com

It also reaffirms the strength and relevance of our model. This is evidenced by France's once again remarkable performance  which continues its double-digit growth at a profitability level close to 5% EBITDA. In other geographies  we are continuing our convergence efforts to achieve these standards across the Group. With this objective in mind  we are progressively deploying our brand identity  accelerating the pooling of our technology tools  and the sharing of our expertise in refurbishing  purchasing  and sales. This has resulted in accelerating inventory turnover across all countries and concrete progress on our local priorities. Building on this progress  we have further improved our profitability while strengthening our cash generation  which has enabled us to very significantly reduce our debt level. We now have all the assets needed to pursue a trajectory of profitable and sustainable growth. »MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN 2025In 2025  Aramis Group deployed the strategy announced at its Capital Markets Day in November 2024 to continue the convergence of its entities  fully capitalize on its European scale  and sustainably anchor its profitable  cash-generative growth.The sharing of expertise intensified across the Group  particularly in vehicle selection and optimization of refurbishing processes  leading to continuous structural improvements. This operational convergence resulted in a marked increase in GPU in the second half of 2025  up more than €85 compared to the first half  reaching €2 359 for the fiscal year.In France  the Group's first market  Aramis Group maintained its profitable growth momentum  confirming the strength of its value proposition and the relevance of its operating model. Vehicle volumes grew steadily  driven by the opening of four new sales points while maintaining a level of profitability in line with the Group's objectives  close to 5% adjusted EBITDA.In Italy  the evolution of the management team and the acceleration of the turnaround enabled a major milestone to be reached with positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2025  while accelerating volume growth.Following the founders’ departure in the United Kingdom and Austria  management and operational transitions are underway. These changes have led to a short-term refocus on profitability and cash generation  with initial effects visible in the last quarter  thereby laying the foundations for profitable growth.The promising rollout of the internal marketplace accelerated with a doubling of intra-group delivery volumes. This platform strengthens value creation at European scale  improving inventory turnover and diversifying the offering.Aramis Group also strengthened its technology and data platform  including the production launch of new applications aimed at better serving its customers through artificial intelligence  as well as the launch of a new vehicle buyback tool for private customers in France and Spain.The unification of brand platforms and visual identity continues across all geographies  strengthening the consistency of Aramis Group's differentiating value proposition.2025 FULL-YEAR ACTVITYOverview of volumes and revenues2025 full-year B2C volumesIn units Reported basis FY 2025 FY 2024 Var. % Refurbished cars 91 219 87 541 +4.2% Pre-registered cars 27 890 24 683 +13.0% Total B2C volumes 119 109 112 224 +6.1%2025 full-year revenuesBy segmentIn millions of euros Reported basis FY 2025 FY 2024 Var. % Refurbished cars 1 556.8 1 512.1 +3.0% Pre-registered cars 554.0 459.1 +20.7% Total B2C 2 110.8 1 971.2 +7.1% Total B2B 145.1 150.6 -3.6% Total Services 123.7 115.8 +6.8% Revenues 2 379.6 2 237.5 +6.3%By countryIn millions of euros Reported basis FY 2025 FY 2024 Var. % France 1 038.1 935.2 +11.0% Belgium 322.8 289.7 +11.4% Spain 311.9 310.7 +0.4% United-Kingdom 490.9 454.1 +8.1% Austria 187.4 220.2 -14.9% Italy 28.5 27.6 +3.3% Revenues 2 379.6 2 237.5 +6.3%Analysis of the change in revenues per segmentB2C – sales of cars to private customers (89% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – reached €2 110.8 million in 2025  up +7.1% compared to fiscal year 2024  including a +6.2% volume effect and a +0.9% price effect.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment reached €1 556.8 million  showing growth of +3.0%  broken down into a positive volume effect of +4.2% partially offset by a price effect of -1.2%. This momentum is however impacted by the transition phase following the departure of the founders in the UK and Austria  a key step to begin a new phase of profitable and sustainable growth in these geographies.Revenues for the pre-registered car segment reached €554.0 million  up +20.7% compared to 2024  including a volume effect of +13.9% and a price effect of +6.8%. This performance demonstrates Aramis Group's ability to seize market opportunities  thanks to its unique supplier network across Europe.The Group continues to gain market share in the segment of vehicles under 8 years old  outperforming it by +6 points during fiscal year 2025. Aramis Group once again demonstrates the quality of its value proposition as an integrated player  capable of purchasing more vehicles at the best price  refurbishing them more efficiently  and serving an ever-growing number of customers in Europe.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (6% of revenues)B2B segment revenue amounted to €145.1 million in 2025  down -3.6% compared to fiscal year 2024  due to a decline in the average selling price of vehicles sold in B2B with an impact of -7.4%  partially offset by an increase in volumes with an impact of +3.8%. B2B segment activity  largely correlated with the volume of vehicles purchased from private customers  is growing again.Services (5% of revenues)Revenue generated by services reached €123.7 million during fiscal year 2025  up +6.8% compared to 2024. This growth was driven  on the one hand  by the increase in B2C vehicle volumes delivered  and on the other hand by the increase in the penetration rate of financing solutions  which now stands at 44%  up +1 points compared to 2024  reflecting the effectiveness of commercial initiatives deployed and the continuous improvement of the service offering.Analysis of the change in revenues per countryRevenue generated in France during fiscal year 2025 reached €1 038.1 million  recording growth of +11.0%. Growth was supported by both refurbished vehicle volumes (+8.7%) and pre-registered vehicle volumes (+16.3%). France  close to the adjusted EBITDA target of 5%  continues to expand its sales network and continues to consolidate its model by enriching its service offerings and investing  together with other Group entities  in improving its information systems.In Belgium  revenue reached €322.8 million  demonstrating significant growth of +11.4%  also driven by the growth in pre-registered vehicle volumes (+13.5%) and refurbished vehicles (+7.1%).In Spain  revenue reached €311.9 million in 2025  driven by volume growth of +2.9% compared to 2024. Growth in Spain was impacted by the flooding of the Valencia sales point (the country's second-largest sales point in terms of sales volume) and its refurbishment center early in the year. The Valencia site fully reopened in May 2025  thus enabling a return to more dynamic growth in Q4 (+6% yoy).Revenue generated in the United Kingdom reached €490.9 million  representing growth of +8.1%  driven by strong volume momentum in the first half (+14.7% yoy). The second half saw a controlled slowdown in growth (-0.3%)  due to a refocus on profitability following the operational departure of the founder in June 2025. Specifically  this resulted in the discontinuation of low-margin vehicle sales and the optimization of marketing expenses  with an improvement in this country's profitability already visible in the last quarter.In Austria  revenue reached €187.4 million  down -14.9% compared to 2024. This change is explained  on the one hand  by an unfavourable base effect after exceptional growth in 2024 driven by one-off sourcing opportunities  and on the other hand by a management transition period following the departure of the entity's historical founder in January 2025.In Italy  volumes sold to private customers declined by -0.6% during the period  while revenue increased by +3.3%. Including deliveries to other Group entities  total volumes sold by Italy increased by +31.1%  with Italian vehicles being sold in other Group countries via the internal marketplace. After three quarters marked by a decline in volumes of -8.2% compared to 2024  notable improvements were observed in the fourth quarter due to the reorganization of the management team and changes in commercial strategy implemented in June  with a sharp increase in volumes sold to private customers of +27.2% and a significant improvement in profitability  with EBITDA turning positive for the first time in the last quarter.INCOME STATEMENTCondensed income statement 7In millions of euros Reported basis FY 2025 FY 2024 Var. % Revenues 2 379.6 2 237.5 +6.3% Gross margin 281.0 256.4 +9.6% Gross profit per B2C vehicle sold - GPU (€) 2 359 2 285 +3.2% Adjusted EBITDA 67.8 50.5 +34.3% Operating income (loss) 28.9 12.2 +137.0% Net profit (loss) 19.9 5.0 +296.3%Gross marginIn 2025  gross margin reached €281.0 million  an increase of +9.6% compared to fiscal year 2024. Gross profit per B2C vehicle sold (GPU) reached €2 359 in 2025  compared to €2 285 in 2024  consolidating Aramis Group's position as a European benchmark8.This improvement results from:the Group's ability to continuously improve the selection of the best vehicles for its customers  thanks to the development of its sourcing channels and its technologies. For example  the C2B channel experienced strong growth in Spain during the second half (+39% compared to the first half)  thus benefiting from the Group's expertise and technological tools.the improvement of its service offering  with  for example in France  the launch of a new financing partnership enabling us to provide a more comprehensive offering to our customers.the refocusing of the strategy on profitability in the UK  by discontinuing low-margin volumes and now focusing on sustainable value creation rather than market share conquest.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA stood at €67.8 million in 2025  compared to €50.5 million the previous year.In addition to the improvement in its unit margins  Aramis Group continues its discipline in managing selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses  which are growing approximately twice as slowly as volumes sold. In particular  marketing expenses amounted to €33.1 million  down -7.1% in unit cost terms (COCA)  demonstrating the continuous optimization of conversions and the increased efficiency of brand image investments.Operating incomeOperating income for fiscal year 2025 more than doubled  reaching €28.9 million compared to €12.2 million in 2024  reflecting the ongoing profitability recovery of the Group.In addition to adjusted EBITDA  operating income includes:- €15.9 million in depreciation and amortization (excluding IFRS 16);- €15.0 million in lease payments (IFRS 16);- €3.6 million in personnel expenses related to acquisitions  compared to -€2.5 million in FY24. These expenses correspond to the provisioning of the earn-out payment for the Onlinecars acquisition and the exercise of the purchase option for the acquisition of 100% of Motor Depot shares. As a reminder  the exercise of the Motor Depot purchase option is £30 million;- €3.1 million in personnel expenses related to share-based payments;restructuring costs or costs related to transactions of -€1.5 million;Net incomeNet income for 2025 quadrupled to €19.9 million compared to €5.0 million in 2024.This figure includes a financial result of -€6.8 million  comprising net financial debt costs of -€4.0 million and lease-related financial charges (IFRS 16) of -€4.4 million. It also includes corporate income tax of -€2.2 million.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREInventory and operating working capital requirementsIn millions of euros Reported basis Sep 30  2025 Mar 31  2025 Sep 30  2024 Inventories 216.2 241.6 222.3 Trade receivables 36.1 41.1 37.1 Other current assets (exc. non-operational items) 40.4 48.2 37.3 Trade payables 89.4 94.2 67.1 Other current liabilities (exc. non-operational items) 61.2 73.6 63.7 Other items 5.4 5.5 4.2 Operating working capital requirements 136.8 157.5 161.7 In days of revenues 21 24 26Operating working capital stood at €136.8 million. It thus represents 21 days of revenue as of September 30  2025  an improvement of 5 days compared to September 30  2024.The improvement in working capital is mainly due to:the inventory reduction  which demonstrates the Group's good management  as it continued its work to accelerate turnover across all countries. This performance also reflects a favourable mix effect driven by the increase in pre-registered vehicle volumes compared to refurbished vehicles. The unit margin improvement strategy in the UK is supported by more selective sourcing  with a temporary impact on volumes and therefore a low point in inventory levels;the increase in trade payables  benefiting from a favourable temporary mix effect on average payment terms  resulting from one-off sourcing concentrated at year-end with partners offering more favourable payment terms.Cash positionIn millions of euros Reported basis FY 2025 FY 2024 Net debt at opening 61.0 82.3 Adjusted EBITDA +67.8 +50.5 Change in operating working capital requirement +24.9 +2.7 Disbursement of personnel liabilities related to acquisitions -7.0 -1.0 Other transaction-related cash flow -0.5 +1.9 Subtotal of cash flow from transactions +85.3 +54.0 Capex -10.4 -13.7 Acquisitions of subsidiaries (excl. fees) +0.0 +0.0 Other investment-related cash flow +5.8 +2.8 Sub-total of cash flow from investing activities -4.7 -10.9 Interest paid -4.1 -4.7 Lease charges (IFRS 16 - interest and capital) -17.9 -17.1 Other financing-related flow (excl. issuing and repayment of borrowings) -3.7 +0.0 Sub-total of cash flow from financing activities -25.7 -21.8 Net debt at closing 6.1 61.0Net debt9 amounted to €6.1 million as of September 30  2025  compared to €61.0 million at the end of September 2024  representing a reduction in net debt of €54.9 million  which breaks down as follows:+€65.6 million in cash generation  driven by EBITDA contribution  significant working capital reduction  and controlled CAPEX. As a reminder  CAPEX mainly consists of investments in the Group's information;-€7.0 million payment for the Onlinecars earn-out  made in March 2025 as planned;-€3.7 million in share buybacks as part of our plan to cover the performance share plan.Aramis Group's balance sheet ratios thus remain very healthy. As of September 30  2025  the Group has approximately €230 million in undrawn and unconditional credit lines.OUTLOOKIn November 2024  Aramis Group announced its new strategic plan aimed at strengthening the performance of all its entities by harmonizing their practices around the Group's operating system  fully capitalizing on its pan-European scale  and continuously enriching its unique model.Since then  the Group has deployed numerous initiatives in each of the countries where it operates  reflecting concrete progress in implementing this plan.Over the coming months  the Group will maintain this momentum but anticipates a more gradual execution pace than initially planned  reflecting its commitment to ensuring effective and sustainable implementation of its initiatives.Considering these challenges and in a macroeconomic environment still characterized by limited visibility  heightened by the political context in France  its primary market  the Group remains both prudent and agile  adjusting its priorities to support its mid-term performance.In this context  Aramis Group targets  for fiscal year 2026:At least 115 000 total B2C vehicles sold volumes;At least €55 million in adjusted EBITDA;In light of the above  the Group reaffirms the ambitions presented at its Capital Markets Day  with the horizon now expected beyond 2027. Thus  Aramis Group targets in the mid-term:‘High single digit’ average annual organic growth in total B2C vehicle volumes;Adjusted EBITDA at approximately 5% of revenueFurthermore  the Group will maintain discipline on its working capital requirements  as historically demonstrated.GOVERNANCEFollowing the Board of Directors meeting on November 26  2025  Aramis Group announces changes to its governance.Following the departure of Philippe de Rovira on July 2  the Board of Directors decided to co-opt Silvia Vernetti as a new director representing Stellantis.

At least until yesterday  I didn’t see any official announcement about this book from PASOK. A logical person  with even minimal political thinking  would say that this is the absolute opportunity for PASOK to inflict damage (in the political sense) on its rival in the Centre-Left. And what couldn’t PASOK write in an announcement about Tsipras and his ministers  who are now scattered across the entire opposition that competes with PASOK? Literally everything: that he… reminds us of the dramatic hours we lived through with SYRIZA and Tsipras  that they are the same people  that they lie  that… that… that… Let’s say that Mitsotakis didn’t make a statement himself  but the spokesperson Marinakis was particularly sharp about the book. Nevertheless  from Androulakis  total grave-like silence. Only one remark from Manolis Othonas  personal friend and close associate of the late Fofi  who denied Tsipras’s claim about an alleged proposal for co-governance. And then a few low-key statements from PASOK MPs  but the official party and the leader—NOT A WORD. Is there an explanation? Does Androulakis not want to upset Alexis because he’s been told that if we ever need to find a prime minister and all MPs need to put their shoulders to the wheel “as long as Mitsotakis falls ” Tsipras will help? I don’t know  I’m speculating  but let’s say I’m just being suspicious. What happened to him that he suddenly became speechless? Any explanation or interpretation is welcome…The book is selling…Anyway  Tsipras’s book—or Tsipras himself  if you prefer—is selling well  which is not necessarily good or bad  in my opinion  for his political future. But it certainly did not go unnoticed. The publishing house says that the 33 000 printed copies were sold out. I know that the TikToks that protothema.gr made about the book reached 2.3 million views and will soon reach 2.5 million. The site itself also did huge numbers  especially regarding how long people stayed on the articles. So they sat down to read what he wrote. Now  what he achieved or what he…ruined will show in time.Dedicated to the Russophiles…Regarding the book  there is something else that Tsipras mentions  without embellishment or frills  which is extremely “instructive” for the Russophiles and Putin-lovers across the country. When they asked for help—whether Tsipras from Putin or Lafazanis from Russia’s top officials—they were given…the award of the open palm  not to say something worse. Not only that  but Putin also took his buddy Angela and snitched that these… slow-witted people were asking them for money.Pierr-EurogroupA full “barrage” of institutional meetings took place the day before yesterday in Berlin for Pierrakakis. First  the Minister of National Economy and Finance met with two federal counterparts—the Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil and the Minister of Digitalization and State Modernization Carsten Wüldberg. He met the German minister who shares the same portfolio with him  and the one who took on the (newly established in Germany) portfolio that Pierrakakis himself held from 2019 for four years. In addition  he was at the Bundestag  where MPs of the CDU/CSU coalition  who participate in the Germany–Greece friendship parliamentary group  were waiting for him. Present was also the group’s president  Thomas Rachel  with whom Pierrakakis spoke for quite some time  while just earlier the Finance Minister had been invited by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation  where he spoke with MPs about relations between the two countries. Now  if you’re asking me what is happening with Pierr’s battle for the Eurogroup presidency  I asked—and they tell me that the match continues  it’s going well  but it is by no means decided. In any case  the Eurogroup presidency was definitely on the main menu during his meetings.They honored Vardis VardinogiannisPersonalities from the entire political and business spectrum  as well as friends and companions  gathered yesterday in the “Alexandra Trianti” hall at the Megaron for the memorial event in honor of Vardis Vardinogiannis  as one year has passed since his passing. The event was opened by his son  Motor Oil Group president and CEO Giannis Vardinogiannis  who spoke warmly about his father. In the artistic segment  curated by director Giorgos Nanouris  Cretan songs were performed by Vasilis Skoulas  as well as marches of the Navy. After all  Crete and the Navy were defining elements of Vardis Vardinogiannis’s personality. Besides the entire Vardinogiannis family  present were the President of the Republic Kostas Tasoulas  Kyriakos Mitsotakis  Nikos Androulakis  former PM Kostas Karamanlis  Archbishop Ieronymos  dozens of current and former ministers and MPs from all parliamentary wings  as well as businesspeople  bankers  and media figures.The “blue tables” beginDecember is the month of the budget—but also of holidays—so it’s suitable for social contacts and strengthening relations. That’s how they see it at the Maximos Mansion as well  and they are planning  for next week—likely 4/12—the first dinner of Mitsotakis with ND MPs. The first “lucky” ones will be the MPs of the Economic Affairs Committee  who have the Budget ahead of them  and logically the venue will be a taverna like Karavitis or Mavros Gatos near Maximos. In no case a “fancy” restaurant.Thanksgiving DinnerI don’t know if you’ve put it in your schedule  but on Thursday the Americans celebrate Thanksgiving  and for them it’s a big holiday. The impact of Thanksgiving reaches Athens too  as yesterday a big dinner was held at the Grande Bretagne  organized by the Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce  with many businesspeople and prominent members present. Ambassador Kimberly Guilfoyle also made an appearance  continuing to be tireless.Tasoulas’s “jab”Politically interesting was President Tasoulas’s speech yesterday at the 251 Air Force Hospital  at an event for the donation of a spatial disorientation device from Parliament. And that’s because he left insinuations about politicians of image  something that some interpreted as a jab at Tsipras—although Tsipras did send him his book with a dedication. “Reality does not change for the better through public relations  or photos  or the whole arsenal of political marketing or the technology of politics ” said the President  who seems he will continue to speak his mind.Rendezvous in Ancient OlympiaMeanwhile  today the journey of the Olympic flame for the winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina in 2026 begins again from our country. Present  of course  will be the president of the Hellenic Olympic Committee Isidoros Kouvelos and IOC president Kirsty Coventry. President Tasoulas will travel by plane from Athens to Andravida and later will meet Coventry. Due to predicted rain  the event was moved inside the Olympic Museum in Olympia; otherwise  the local schools were scheduled to attend. According to the program  the Olympic anthem will be recited by coloratura soprano Christina Poulitsi  and actor Giannis Stankoglou will recite Takis Doxas’s poem “The Light of Olympia.” A little later  the high priestess Mary Mina will hand the Olympic flame to the first torchbearer  rowing Olympian Petros Gaïdatzis.They’re rolling out doughThere is significant activity in the dough market  as related products appear to be showing strong demand. Of course  negotiations between companies do not always yield results. According to information  the negotiations that Chrysi Zymi/Vivartia held with the sector company “Rodoula” ultimately did not proceed  as it is said that the two sides did not agree on the business plan they would implement if the acquisition went ahead. Chrysi Zymi/Vivartia is reported to have knocked on other doors in the sector as well  though without any result  even though high prices were offered.100% of Hellenic Lotteries to OPAPOPAP’s nine-month results exceeded expectations  even though last year’s results for the same period had been strengthened by Joker’s performance  in an excellent year also due to Euro 2024. Therefore  the increase in this year’s nine-month period carries greater weight  highlighting the momentum the organization has developed. Significant  of course  was the boost from the giga jackpot last August  which was the largest in the game’s history  leading to increased traffic in the retail network  higher visits to the online platforms  and generally greater player activity. Thus  gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the nine months of 2025 reached €1.77 billion (compared to €1.64 billion last year)  up 6.5%  while EBITDA was strengthened by 4.4%. OPAP’s organic growth is also evident from the fact that the online gaming segment recorded a 10.8% increase in GGR and a 4.8% increase from the store network. Beyond that  the tender for the State Lotteries is progressing  with OPAP running alone in the race. After the opening of the financial bid it submitted (through its subsidiary OPAP INVESTMENT)  it was asked to submit an improved financial offer  which was submitted a few days ago  on 21/11. But there was also another development  as OPAP decided to acquire the share (16.5%) held by Scientific Games Global Gaming in Hellenic Lotteries S.A. The purchase price will be paid in cash by OPAP INVESTMENT upon completion of the transaction (i.e.  with the transfer of shares) and amounts to a total of €49.5 thousand  while obligations of about €2 million are also assumed. After the completion of the transaction  OPAP INVESTMENT LTD will hold 100% of Hellenic Lotteries.Changes in the ATHEX Board of DirectorsEuronext is taking the reins of ATHEX and is starting with changes to the Board of Directors. Specifically  the ATHEX Board is convening to decide on calling an extraordinary General Assembly that will change the Board. According to information  the CEO remains  as his contract expires in June 2026  while 3–4 Board members will be replaced  with Euronext appointing people of its own choosing  marking the new era of the Athens Stock Exchange. Expected  but still of interest.The shortest conference call in historyThe third-quarter profits of ATHEX were historic in size. So was the duration of yesterday’s conference call between management and analysts. It did not last more than 15 minutes. Management presented the net profits  which skyrocketed +103% to €26.8 million  and turnover +62.6%  reaching €64.7 million  with 73.4% coming from trading activity and post-trading services. The CEO thanked the analysts for their cooperation  the share price on the Exchange was sliding to €6  and the modest ceremony wrapped up quickly without a single question about the future  about Euronext (incidentally  Stéphane Boujnah is coming to Athens tomorrow)  or anything else. No questions were asked about the explosive increase in personnel costs (+27%) or operational costs (+33%). Naturally  nor about management bonuses.A new banking license for Alpha BankMeanwhile  Alpha Bank is making significant moves in the area of wealth management. This specific activity of the bank is gaining a strong international footprint  with Unicredit helping in this direction by promoting Alpha Bank’s high-level services and products in other markets—as Alpha Bank does as well. At the same time  the development of a strong Alpha presence in Cyprus now plays a major role—Cyprus being a bridge market toward the Middle East and beyond. In addition  Alpha Bank holds a banking license in England  a benchmark country for wealth services. However  I saved the new development for last: Alpha Bank is expected to obtain a banking license in Luxembourg  a market also with a strong footprint in wealth-management services  where the bank currently has a presence as a branch.Strong demand in the green-bond marketPiraeus Bank was not alone yesterday in the markets with a green-bond issuance  as demand for such bonds is skyrocketing. Alongside the Greek banking institution  the Danish Danske Bank also proceeded yesterday with a similar €750 million green issuance  while Banque Postal also issued a senior bond. Thus  the Greek bank preferred to wait for the announcements of the other two banks before opening its own order book. And despite coming third in line  it managed to gather demand four times higher than the €500 million issuance. The result should be attributed to the broader demand for green issues  as well as to the bank’s strong ESG performance. Earlier  MSCI upgraded the bank’s ESG rating to ‘AAA’.Black Friday in loans (for whoever can stand it)The advertisement catches the eye. A large red velvet armchair  the “Black Friday” logo  and beneath it the invitation: “CONSUMER CREDIT with excellent conditions.” Postbank  Eurobank’s subsidiary in Bulgaria  is advertising its consumer loans these days at… Black Friday prices. On the bank’s website there is also a “loan calculator.” You can borrow 23 000 lev (about €11 760) for 96 months—eight full years of payments for the purchases of a single week—at an interest rate not exceeding 7%. Postbank is currently the fourth-largest bank in Bulgaria with a market share of around 12%. Its consumer-loan portfolio strengthened after the acquisition of BNP Paribas Personal Finance in 2023. The Bulgarian consumer-loan market is growing (as happened in Greece before the adoption of the euro)  with fierce competition between UBB  TBI Bank  DSK  and Postbank. All of this in the neighboring country is reminiscent of Greece during the era of lobster-pasta and vacation loans. I hope the Bulgarians have better luck.From auction to…auctionA permanent spot on the lists of electronic auctions has been taken by the unique 50-acre plot with the building complex of the Emfietzoglou family in Anavryta. Having been targeted by both Intrum and Cepal  it repeatedly reaches the brink of the hammer  but either the auction ends fruitless or the process is suspended at the last moment. On October 15  the 50% undivided share belonging to Prodromos Emfietzoglou went up for auction  with Cepal as the foreclosing party and with a price that  after objection  stood at €12.5 million  but there was no interest. In the repeat auction held on November 20  at the same price  the process was suspended. For today  November 26  a similar auction had been scheduled with Intrum as foreclosing party and a starting price of €11.6 million  but that too was suspended. According to information from the column  however  the next one has already been scheduled  with Cepal as the foreclosing party  for December 19  but with a 20% “discount ” meaning the bar has been lowered to €10 million. As everything indicates  the series will have many more episodes…Inside the mind of Semiramis PaliouSemiramis Paliou’s move to submit an official offer  through NYSE-listed Diana Shipping  to acquire the remaining stake of Genco for 750 million dollars is being interpreted on Wall Street as a message with multiple recipients—not only toward Genco’s management but also toward the broader shipping community. In the offices of investment groups  it is being commented that Paliou is attempting to “lock in” her company’s position in a sector—the dry-bulk shipping sector—that is entering a period of reconfiguration. Diana already owns 14.8% of Genco  and the fact that it is moving from the stage of minority participation to a proposal for full acquisition is considered a sign that the company is not simply seeking strategic presence but active control. The premium of the offer  15% to 23% depending on the reference point  is interpreted by market participants as an attempt to accelerate the process and limit possible resistance. In the close circle of shipping analysts  it is pointed out that the pricing is aligned with the highest levels of Genco’s stock over the last decade  something that gives the offer a character of “argumentation” toward shareholders  not a simple approach. At the same time  Paliou’s reference to loan financing for the transaction and to subsequent targeted divestments draws attention. Behind the scenes  this is read as an intention to reshape the structure if the acquisition is completed  with a more concentrated and flexible form  selecting executives from both sides and with a clear decision-making center. On a symbolic level  the move sends the message that Paliou is positioning Diana as a front-line player in a phase of dry bulk where scale and speed of change are gaining increased weight. The interest now shifts to Genco: whether it will view the offer as an opportunity or as a starting point for negotiation. Whatever its response  Semiramis’s initiative has already created a fact the market cannot ignore.Turkish shipping companies in GreeceI hear that a major discussion has opened within circles of the Turkish shipping industry regarding the relocation of shipping-company headquarters to the wider Athens area. Business conditions are considered favorable  and many companies are thinking about it. The beginning has already been made with the largest Turkish shipping company  Ciner Shipping  which has offices in Glyfada  and others are expected to follow. The Turkish owner of the group  Turgay Ciner  was the owner  besides the shipping company  of very large media outlets such as Haberturk and the Turkish Bloomberg  which he sold in 2024. The company has a large shipbuilding program underway for 28 bulkers in various Chinese shipyards that will increase its fleet to 49 ships. Since the beginning of 2024  it has already taken delivery of 15 of them and the remaining 13 are expected by 2028. The parent company  Ciner Group  is a Turkish multinational active in the fields of energy and mining.Shipping under pressure from green billionsShipping is entering ever more deeply into a new era  with heavy cash obligations. The Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)  combined with the upcoming FuelEU Maritime (for the use of alternative fuels) and OPS obligations (onshore power-supply infrastructure) of European ports  leave little room for relaxed moves. The 2.9 billion dollars that shipping companies are expected to pay this year is only the beginning: by 2026 the cost may reach 7.5 billion  with the full emissions regime applying to all greenhouse gases. The biggest “losers” are containerships  which account for one third of emissions  while RoPax and passenger ships see costs reach 1 million dollars per vessel. Port authorities  for their part  are required to spend millions on onshore power supply  creating networks that often correspond to the consumption of a small city. Behind the scenes  shipowners say that Europe is moving at the speed of light in environmental measures  while other regions of the world remain more relaxed. The result is an asymmetric economic field: increased operating costs and investments in technology  while international competitors exploit the “European punishment.” No matter how much large shipping companies try to pass the cost on to customers through “green” products  the reality is that Europe is creating a new economic environment for the sea  where ecological awareness is paid for dearly and geopolitical reconfigurations make emissions even more expensive.Coca-Cola HBC’s triple board (and Russia in the background)Yesterday’s upward move of Coca-Cola HBC pushed the market capitalization of the world’s third-largest Coca-Cola bottler above 16 billion euros. Behind the share’s movement are expectations of an end to the Russia–Ukraine war—markets in which Coca-Cola HBC had significant activity as Coca-Cola. Twelve years ago  in 2013  in the midst of the Greek economic crisis  Coca-Cola HBC’s management chose London as its primary trading market and Athens as secondary  while the company’s headquarters were moved to “safe” Switzerland. Last month  Coca-Cola HBC decided to attempt a landing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange as well. It agreed to acquire 75% of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) from Coca-Cola Company and the Gutsche family for 2.6 billion dollars. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2026. The plan is clear: Athens preserves the historicity of the share  London offers abundant liquidity and trading depth  and Johannesburg symbolizes growth in the promising African continent. All of this at 16.11 billion euros.CENERGY’s dense stock-market activityHaris Iliadis of Goldman Sachs has long maintained a close friendly relationship with Giannis Stasinopoulos  who is particularly involved with Cenergy. Michalis Stasinopoulos oversees more VIOHALCO and ELVALHALCOR. Lately  Goldman Sachs has been paying special attention to Cenergy  whose market capitalization has surpassed 3.2 billion euros. Large blocks of Cenergy shares are being traded daily. Yesterday  shares worth 22.2 million euros changed hands. Early in the morning  two blocks of Cenergy shares worth 17.5 million euros crossed the market. Obviously  institutional investors are buying at a price lower than the market price (a 5.5% discount compared to the previous closing price). A little later  at 11:30  another block changed hands at a price of 14.86 euros per share. The total value of the three blocks is estimated at 18.16 million euros. All this at a time when Cenergy’s share price (15.08 euros) is 79% higher than the corresponding value last year.Metlen gave courage to the entire marketThe release of Metlen’s share (+5.25% at 44.50 euros) from the short-term strategic moves imposed by the MSCI index rebalancing sent a message of relief and optimism to the Stock Exchange. The General Index closed with gains of +1.05% at 2 087.20 points  with transaction value at 225.3 million euros and block trades worth 47.6 million euros. After midday  and once the market was convinced that Metlen was returning to its old  good self  a buying breeze began that swept along even the sluggish bank shares  while it put wind in the sails of Aegean (+3.6% at 14.4 euros)  PPC (+2.94% at €17.5)  Coca-Cola (+2.91% at €43.1)  as well as TITAN (+1.24% at €45.05)  OPAP (+1.11% at €17.45)  Sarantis (+1.14% at €12.4)  and ELVALHALCOR (+1.72% at €3.25). The banks did their duty by maintaining the General Index’s positive momentum  but without many transactions: National Bank (+1.16% at €13.16)  Alpha (+0.56% at €3.60)  Piraeus at 7.02 euros  and an indifferent Eurobank at €3.40 (+0.06%).Trump’s big trick with the DebtAmerica carries an unfathomable debt burden. It’s not only the 38 trillion dollars of public debt. It is the 130 trillion dollars that include corporate debt  consumer debt  and pension obligations. Donald Trump believes he has found the solution: devaluation of the Debt through inflation. The less the dollar is worth  the smaller the weight of the debt becomes. The recipe resembles losing weight by redefining what “kilogram” means. For the plan to be implemented  the Central Bank  the FED  must lower dollar interest rates. The President does not want to become involved in yet another constitutional crisis. He will wait for Powell’s term to end. At the same time  however  he has decided to appoint a “shadow” FED chair. It will be an alternative narrator of monetary policy who will systematically undermine Jerome Powell’s positions before his term ends in May 2026. As Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated yesterday  the President will announce the name before Christmas. Trump knows that markets look ahead—they discount. When Powell’s successor is officially announced  someone who will promise much lower interest rates  the yield curve and long-term rates will fall  even before he officially takes office. Markets will begin to “price in” the new policy as early as January. The goal is ambitious: for dollar interest rates to fall by 3 percentage points by the midterm elections  on November 3  2026. If he succeeds  Americans will get cheaper mortgages  businesses will refinance their loans at lower cost  there will be liquidity in the markets  and an atmosphere of prosperity before the polls. The obvious natural consequence—the new reality—will of course bring a weaker dollar and the return of inflation. But that will happen after the midterms. Meanwhile  bond and currency markets will operate with two conflicting narratives simultaneously. Fed policy by proxy.China hits Trump where it hurtsTariff negotiations continue  but China is implementing—at high speed—its strategic plan for new monetary balances. In just the last quarter  Beijing “unloaded”—literally—U.S. bonds worth 32 billion dollars  reducing its total position to 700.5 billion dollars  the lowest level of the past 17 years. At the same time  the Chinese are investing massively in gold. Chinese flows into gold ETFs (exchange-traded gold funds) skyrocketed to 4.5 billion dollars in October  with total assets under management reaching 29 billion—an all-time record for that month. In simple terms: China is reducing its exposure to potential American sanctions and geopolitical blackmail. It is turning to assets not controlled by Washington.
