53916,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/628554-euroclear-assets-eu-damage-reputation/,Euroclear issues stark warning to EU over Russian assets plot – FT,Brussels attempts to use sovereign Russian assets to fund Kiev’s war-chest could spike the EU’s borrowing costs and damage its reputation Read Full Article at RT.com,Brussels’ attempts to use sovereign Russian assets to fund Kiev risks long-term reputational damage  the clearing house has reportedly warnedThe EU could face increased borrowing costs and long-term global reputational damage if it forces through its latest plan to use frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance new loans for Ukraine  Belgian depository Euroclear has warned  according to the Financial Times.The privately owned clearing house holds around $200 billion of the $300 billion in Russian Central Bank assets frozen in the West after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. EU leaders want to issue a ‘reparation loan’ to Kiev by using those holdings as collateral. Moscow has denounced any such move as outright theft.The Brussels-backed plot would be seen globally as “confiscation of central bank reserves  undermining the rule of law” by investors such as sovereign wealth funds and central banks  Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain has warned  in a letter seen by the FT.She also warned that the move would make European debt appear riskier and push up government borrowing costs across the bloc for a long time  the paper reported Thursday.Urbain has previously cautioned that privately owned Euroclear could sue the EU if it attempts to confiscate the Russian sovereign funds held there.The push to seize Russian assets has intensified as the US promotes a new initiative to settle the Ukraine conflict. US President Donald Trump has expressed optimism that a settlement could be reached. European officials  however  fear the American proposal could complicate the bloc’s plans  with the German newspaper Handelsblatt reporting that it might compel the EU to reimburse any diverted Russian funds.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed Brussels’ intent to press ahead with the asset grab on Tuesday while pledging continued EU support for Kiev. The Commission insists the proposed scheme does not amount to confiscation  though officials acknowledge there is a risk it will be perceived that way.Russia has long stated that any attempt to seize its Central Bank assets would be regarded as “theft” and would undermine trust in Western financial institutions. Russian officials have accused Brussels of trying to prolong the Ukraine conflict for political advantage and to justify rising military budgets that benefit European arms manufacturers.,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Russian assets plot', 'stark warning', 'Euroclear', 'FT', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'US President Donald Trump', 'long-term global reputational damage', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'long-term reputational damage', 'central bank reserves', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'German newspaper Handelsblatt', 'rising military budgets', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Belgian depository Euroclear', 'Western financial institutions', 'European arms manufacturers', 'government borrowing costs', 'Russian funds', 'central banks', 'Russian officials', 'Financial Times', 'European debt', 'clearing house', 'latest plan', 'new loans', 'reparation loan', 'outright theft', 'Brussels-backed plot', 'long time', 'new initiative', 'American proposal', 'asset grab', 'political advantage', 'European officials', 'Ukraine conflict', 'European Commission', 'Brussels’ attempts', 'Brussels’ intent', 'EU leaders', 'EU support', 'Kiev risks', 'privately', 'escalation', 'holdings', 'collateral', 'Moscow', 'move', 'confiscation', 'rule', 'law', 'investors', 'letter', 'bloc', 'push', 'optimism', 'settlement', 'plans', 'diverted', 'Tuesday', 'scheme', 'trust']",2025-11-27,2025-11-28,rt.com
53917,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/what-are-putins-ultimate-demands-for-peace-in-ukraine,What are Putin’s Ultimate Demands for Peace in Ukraine?,The Trump Administration has claimed that it’s nearing a deal to end the war  but  for now  the conflict’s essential impasse still holds: Moscow won’t accept what Kyiv can stomach.,Indeed  on November 24th  Ukrainian officials announced that  after meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials  in Geneva  they had come up with their own  nineteen-point plan. In the new draft  Zelensky said  “many of the right elements have been taken into account.”The next day  Trump announced that Witkoff would travel to Moscow  and Dan Driscoll  the Secretary of the Army  would fly to Kyiv. “There are only a few remaining points of disagreement ” Trump said. But  heading into the Thanksgiving holiday  there are now essentially two proposals: a Witkoff plan and a Rubio plan. One suits Russia  the other Ukraine. The war’s essential logic has again revealed itself: Moscow won’t accept what Kyiv can stomach.Throughout Trump’s second term  officials in Kyiv have appeared more willing to make concessions than many observers realize. The country’s situation on the battlefield  while not catastrophic  is unfavorable. Ukraine lacks sufficient numbers of combat-ready infantry  and its drones are not able to fully defend against the Russian onslaught. Russia  though its advances have come at enormous cost to its forces  has achieved an operational momentum that Ukraine has struggled to halt. The situation in the southern front  around Zaporizhzhia  has become as worrying as that in the east  where the battle for the city of Pokrovsk has attracted the most attention. Members of the Ukrainian military are questioning the competency of the top command and the ability of their forces to hold the line. According to Balazs Jarabik  a former European diplomat with extensive connections in Kyiv  security officials have told him that “Armageddon is coming.”Meanwhile  a corruption scandal unfolded in Kyiv earlier this month in which several top officials  including a longtime Zelensky confidant with interests in the energy and drone sectors  were implicated in a hundred-million-dollar kickback scheme. NABU  an independent anticorruption body that Zelensky had tried but failed to bring under his authority this summer  released a series of incriminating surveillance tapes. In the videos  a suspect complains that his back hurts from carrying so many bags of cash; another says it’s not worth spending the money to protect electrical substations from Russian attack—an infuriating statement in a winter of rolling blackouts. “The scandal shook the state to the core ” Jarabik said. “Everyone was wondering  Who else is on these tapes?” Zelensky  even if not directly involved  was left politically wounded.The country’s fiscal crisis has also become too acute to ignore. According to estimates by the European Commission  over the next two years Ukraine will need more than a hundred and thirty billion euros to fill holes in its budget. With Trump in the White House  that money is not likely coming from the U.S. In theory  the problem could be solved by an E.U. proposal  which would reportedly provide Ukraine with a hundred and forty billion euros from an even larger sum of frozen Russian assets that are being held in Europe. However  that effort has stalled  and the sums may never reach Ukraine; Belgium  the home of Euroclear  one of the continent’s chief securities depositories  is wary of taking on the sole legal responsibility for the maneuver.The Kremlin is keenly aware of the pressures that Zelensky and the Ukrainian state are under. If anything  Putin has consistently overestimated this factor. “He thinks for him to get what he wants he just needs to push a bit more ” Tatiana Stanovaya  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center  told me. “He will squeeze every last drop. Trump will twist Ukraine’s arm or the country will be weakened to the point that it has no choice.”That’s not to say that Russia is entirely without its own reasons to consider a deal. Oil prices are down. U.S. sanctions imposed in October on Rosneft and Lukoil  two of Russia’s largest oil companies  have eaten into the Kremlin’s most important revenue stream—this month  income from oil-and-gas sales was down about a quarter from a year ago. Importers in India and China  the two most important markets for Russian oil  have scaled down or even cancelled their purchases. Meanwhile  Ukraine has stepped up its campaign of drone strikes on refining and processing facilities inside Russia. As for the military effort  enlistment numbers fell to a two-year low this summer.

This move aims to maintain pressure on Russia and bolster Ukraine's defense. European leaders are discussing this crucial financing option. The European Commission prop…,"Live EventsPerks of the dealThe assets frozen in Belgiumas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channelMoney is as central to Europe's vital support of Ukraine as ammunition and intelligence. Yet  the bloc's most viable funding mechanism involves seizing billions of dollars worth of Russian assets that US President Donald Trump has proposed taking over.The first draft of Trump's 28-point peace plan called for an investment scheme for Ukraine's reconstruction controlled by the US but financed by USD 100 billion in frozen Russian assets matched by another USD 100 billion from the European Union - with 50 per cent of profits sent back to Washington.The plan surprised Europeans  who have spent years fiercely debating the fate of Russia 's frozen fortune.Those funds are central to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen 's plan to both maintain pressure on Russia and increase support for Ukraine as mysterious drone incursions and sabotage operations rattle European capitals.""I cannot see any scenario in which the European taxpayers alone will pay the bill "" she said Wednesday in Strasbourg  France   to applause from lawmakers in the European Parliament.The 27-nation EU has sent Ukraine almost USD 197 billion since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago. While there's no consensus on how to provide more aid  there's near unanimity on seizing the Russian assets to cover the estimated USD 153 billion for Ukraine's budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027.The Commission has proposed paying that bill with joint debt taken on by the EU and grants by individual nations  but its main source is the USD 225 billion assets frozen at Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial institution.That is  if the Trump administration doesn't get them first.Trump's brash negotiating style left many in Europe suspecting he wants a quick deal that forces Europeans to make it work and pay for it. All while the US profits.Analysts say the proposal was essentially a US attempt to snatch these assets  coming as Brussels and Washington relaunch trade negotiations over tariffs.Agathe Demarais  a senior fellow at the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign Relations  said the proposal was akin to a ""signing bonus"" for a peace deal heavily slanted towards Russia.Fabian Zuleeg  chief executive of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre   called the US takeover of the assets ""outrageous "" but suggested it might also be acceptable to Europeans ""if that is ultimately the price to pay for a good deal.""After intense discussions between the US  Germany  France  the United Kingdom and representatives from the European Commission  the investment scheme was removed from the new draft peace plan. Russia has already signalled its total rejection of the new draft.A quick seizure of Russia's frozen assets by the EU would not only secure Ukraine's defence budget  but also empower Brussels at the negotiation table  Demarais said.""If the EU rushes to seize Russia's central bank assets before Washington grabs them  the bloc may be able to drastically curb Trump's interest in a bad deal "" she said.The European Commission has proposed taking direct ownership of the assets. Under von der Leyen's leadership  it could then issue a loan to Ukraine  which would be repaid only if Moscow provides war reparations to Kyiv.The bulk of these assets are held in a clearinghouse called Euroclear in Belgium. However  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has refused to approve their use as collateral for a massive loan for Ukraine  citing fears that Russia would retaliate against Belgian interests.""We are a small country  and retaliation could be very hard "" De Wever said in October.Yet the Belgian position on thawing the assets was influenced by an impasse in local politics over deep federal debt. After months of domestic political wrangling ended last week in a deal  politicians from Riga to Lisbon started hoping that De Wever would be able to lift his objections to seizing Russian assets.Sweden's Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said after the Brussels meeting on Wednesday ""the clock is ticking"" and that seizing the assets was ""the only realistic financing option that would make a real difference and one that would be most fair to taxpayers"" in Europe.Kaja Kallas  the EU's top diplomat said Wednesday there is now broad EU support for Belgium.""It would send the strongest message to Moscow that it cannot wait us out  and we need to make this decision fast "" said Kallas.On Dec 18  De Wever will join the other EU national leaders for a summit in Brussels over  among other subjects  seizing the Russian assets.",negative,0.0,0.44,0.55,mixed,0.11,0.22,0.67,True,English,"['Ukraine peace deal', 'frozen assets', 'Russia', 'centre', 'negotiations', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'Brussels-based European Policy Centre', 'US President Donald Trump', 'other EU national leaders', 'new draft peace plan', 'Brussels-based financial institution', 'viable funding mechanism', 'mysterious drone incursions', 'brash negotiating style', 'Berlin-based European Council', 'The European Commission', 'domestic political wrangling', 'realistic financing option', 'Trusted News Source', 'deep federal debt', '28-point peace plan', 'central bank assets', 'broad EU support', 'frozen Russian assets', 'USD 225 billion assets', 'The Commission', 'Foreign Relations', 'Belgian interests', 'Belgian position', 'European Union', 'European capitals', 'European Parliament', 'other subjects', 'peace deal', 'first draft', 'main source', 'frozen fortune', 'European taxpayers', 'joint debt', 'Live Events', 'vital support', 'investment scheme', '50 per cent', 'sabotage operations', 'military needs', 'individual nations', 'US attempt', 'trade negotiations', 'senior fellow', 'signing bonus', 'Fabian Zuleeg', 'chief executive', 'US takeover', 'intense discussions', 'United Kingdom', 'total rejection', 'quick seizure', 'negotiation table', 'direct ownership', 'war reparations', 'small country', 'local politics', 'real difference', 'top diplomat', 'strongest message', '27-nation EU', 'Trump administration', 'quick deal', 'good deal', 'bad deal', 'US profits', 'Agathe Demarais', 'defence budget', 'massive loan', 'Kaja Kallas', 'Brussels meeting', 'Perks', 'Belgium', 'Reliable', 'Addas', 'Money', 'Ukraine', 'ammunition', 'intelligence', 'bloc', 'billions', 'dollars', 'reconstruction', 'Washington', 'Europeans', 'years', 'fate', 'funds', 'pressure', 'scenario', 'Strasbourg', 'France', 'lawmakers', 'consensus', 'aid', 'unanimity', 'grants', 'Euroclear', 'Analysts', 'proposal', 'tariffs', 'price', 'Germany', 'representatives', 'leadership', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'bulk', 'clearinghouse', 'collateral', 'fears', 'retaliation', 'October', 'impasse', 'months', 'politicians', 'Riga', 'Lisbon', 'objections', 'Sweden', 'Wednesday', 'clock', 'decision', 'summit', '2026']",2025-11-27,2025-11-28,economictimes.indiatimes.com

The fear has always been that US president Donald Trump  in pursuit of international credit for brokering a peace deal  will strong-arm Ukraine into accepting one that favours Moscow.The recent plan triggered days of frantic efforts by Ukraine and European states to push back against the most unacceptable points of the proposal  such as the suggestion Ukrainian forces give up territory in the east that Russia’s invading army had failed to take.It’s not the first time Kyiv and other European governments have had to employ a full-court diplomatic scramble to tug the White House back from seemingly sliding towards Moscow’s viewpoint in the stop-start negotiations.Speaking in the Europa Building in Brussels  where the EU summits are hosted  Costa plays down the weight that should be put on the recent US proposal.“Secretary of state Marco Rubio explained to the world that this is not an official plan  it is not an official proposal from the United States  but just a working paper ” he says.“All the efforts  especially from president Trump  to push Russia to the negotiating table  are very welcome ” he says.European leaders keep repeating that a deal cannot be negotiated above their heads  given the terms of any truce will have major consequences for the security of the continent.“What we agreed with the United States of course  is when it comes to negotiate the issues regarding the European Union  they need to talk with the European Union ” Costa says.Does Europe have a plan to bring about an end to the full-scale war  which began nearly four years ago when Russia invaded Ukraine?“Our peace plan started on February 24th 2022  when we met in this building ... and took the decision to ensure full support for Ukraine  diplomatically and economically ” Costa says.The years since have seen EU states jointly provide Ukraine with huge amounts of military and financial aid. The bloc continues to expand a regime of economic sanctions targeting Russia  with the aim of hampering its ability to finance its war.The efforts of Trump to put an end to the fighting should be given space to succeed  Costa says. “Creating a parallel channel is not productive.”However  if Washington comes up short then Europe should explore other ways to bring about a stable ceasefire  he says. “This war has already lasted too long and this war needs to finish. It’s time for Russia to stop the aggression  to stop the killing  to stop destroying the country  and to engage seriously like the Ukrainians are doing ” Costa says.“Peace cannot mean capitulation and cannot mean a temporary truce  we need an effective peace.”At the beginning of this year there were concerns the Trump administration might walk away from the Nato military alliance  or pull all support for Ukraine. Those fears had not come to pass  he says. The transatlantic partnership had been “stabilised”.The former Portuguese prime minister took over as European Council president late last year. The top EU job involves nudging the 27 heads of state and government into agreement on the big-picture decisions for the union. In most cases all 27 must unanimously agree.Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty ImagesCosta’s skills as a mediator will be tested at asummit on December 18th. There  the 27 leaders will be expected to emerge with a decision taken on how they plan to shore up the EU’s future financial support to Kyiv.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has proposed using €180 billion in Russian central bank assets – frozen in Europe by economic sanctions – to back a loan.The money  which would finance Ukraine’s war chest for at least two years  would be repaid only if Moscow agreed to pay compensation for the destruction caused by its invasion.The assets have been sitting in Euroclear  a Belgian-based depository that holds securities and state bonds. The Belgian government continues to express concerns about using the Russian state assets to finance a “reparations” loan  on the basis it might be exposed to costly legal challenges  or some other retaliation from Moscow.Sustained negotiations are taking place to get Belgium onside. “It’s an ongoing process but it’s going well ” Costa says.He hopes legal and technical issues will be ironed out before the other EU leaders arrive in Brussels for the summit.The group has already given a clear political signal that it would help Ukraine meet the cost of funding its defensive efforts for the next two years. “This is a powerful message and I hope that Russia understands what it means. It means that they cannot count on the exhaustion of Ukraine ” he says.One significant change since Costa started chairing the EU summits last December is the dynamic between the European Council and the commission.His predecessor  Charles Michel  had a famously fractious and competitive relationship with von der Leyen  leading to constant squabbling and political positioning between the top man in the Europa Building and his counterpart across the road in the commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.Repairing that frayed bond between the two most powerful EU institutions was one of Costa’s first jobs.The former prime minister knew the German commission president from the years he sat around the summit table in his former role  representing Portugal.The pair have built up a solid trust on the understanding they both have different roles to play  he says. “This is very good for my work  for her work and for the image of the European Union.”National leaders privately welcome the fact the EU’s top two officials are no longer getting in each other’s way. The summits are smoother too. “My job is not to make decisions  but to help the others make decisions ” Costa says.He will be judged when they all get together in December.,neutral,0.03,0.75,0.22,mixed,0.07,0.22,0.71,True,English,"['EU chief', 'Peace', 'Ukraine', 'capitulation', 'Russia', 'six other leading European media outlets', 'former Portuguese prime minister', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian central bank assets', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Kyiv.
