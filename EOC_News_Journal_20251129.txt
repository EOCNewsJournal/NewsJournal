Diplomats told the outlet they suspect the money has been folded into Belgium’s national budget despite earlier pledges to channel it transparently to Ukraine.“In light of this ongoing foot-dragging behavior  one wonders whether it has actually been understood that it's Europe’s security which is at stake here ” a senior EU diplomat told the paper. Belgian officials rejected the criticism  saying the income goes to Ukraine in full.Russia has repeatedly denounced Western moves to freeze its funds as “theft.” President Vladimir Putin has warned that plans to tap the funds to support Ukraine would damage the West’s credibility  adding that Moscow is preparing retaliatory measures if such plans go ahead.,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,negative,0.0,0.35,0.65,True,English,"['Russian asset seizure plan', 'Von der Leyen', 'Belgium', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'huge legal threats', 'ongoing foot-dragging behavior', 'EU financial markets', 'several EU states', 'senior EU diplomat', 'Russian state assets', 'eventual peace deal', 'reparations loan scheme', 'Belgian officials', 'Russian assets', 'eventual settlement', 'sovereign assets', '€140 billion loan', 'EU Commission', 'bargaining tool', 'probable event', 'losing party', 'tax revenue', 'national budget', 'earlier pledges', 'Western moves', 'retaliatory measures', 'EU plan', 'immobilized funds', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'collateral damage', 'windfall income', 'frozen funds', 'opposition', 'plot', 'leverage', 'Kiev', 'Ukraine', 'prospects', 'country', 'worded', 'letter', 'Thursday', 'Politico', 'Moscow', 'Belgium', 'claims', 'repayment', 'turmoil', 'Diplomats', 'outlet', 'money', 'light', 'Europe', 'security', 'stake', 'paper', 'criticism', 'plans', 'credibility']",2025-11-28,2025-11-29,rt.com

Using frozen Russian assets to provide a Reparations Loan to Ukraine is a forceful step in this direction that Europeans could take without US involvement.NEW YORK – As the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches  the European Union has yet to take one of the most powerful steps that would make a real difference on the ground in Ukraine: use frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine fight off Russia’s army. Doing so would go a long way toward securing Ukraine’s future – and Europe’s  too.Eric Feferberg/Getty Images The AI Labor Shock Is Coming for Women Noreena Hertz warns that the latest wave of automation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on female workers. Cheng Xin/Getty Images Free Trade Can’t Bring Peace Benn Steil shows that globalization always depended on global security  not the other way around. Andres Kudacki/Getty Images Mamdani’s Big Bet Slavoj Žižek thinks New York’s incoming democratic-socialist mayor understands how American politics is changing.This week  French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that EU countries will finalize a solution for financial support of Ukraine in the coming days. As Russia continues to pummel Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure – homes  power generation and distribution systems  and heating and water systems – the need for financial support is great. Even if the war ends in 2026  and without considering the enormous costs of reconstruction  amounting to well over $500 billion  Ukraine will need around $140 billion in the next two years  in addition to other financing  owing to the war’s effects on its economy.Ukraine continues to resist valiantly  fighting the much bigger invader to a virtual standstill. Russian casualties (killed and wounded) exceed one million. Yet the loss of so many lives has gained Russia relatively little – devastated territories and populations  land laid waste by some of the fiercest fighting since World War II and now strewn with mines. Russia has failed to achieve any of its original strategic goals in launching the war.In February 2022  soon after Russia’s full-scale invasion  $300 billion in Russian central bank assets (mostly interest-paying securities) were immobilized in Western financial institutions. In October 2024  the G7 countries established an Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) program  providing loans to Ukraine financed by interest from those immobilized Russian assets. Under the ERA program  about €30.9 billion ($35.7 billion) of the planned €45 billion loan envelope has been disbursed so far.But what about the underlying assets immobilized in European jurisdictions? Many have matured into cash  which Euroclear – the Belgian financial institution that holds the lion’s share of the assets – has been placing in an account at the European Central Bank bearing very little interest.A recent EU Council meeting discussed using these assets to make a “Reparations Loan” to Ukraine  in the amount of €210 billion  repayable only if Russia compensates Ukraine for the destruction it has caused. In practical terms  the only difference would be that Euroclear invests the cash in AAA-rated Commission bonds instead of AAA-rated ECB deposits. Russia could  in principle  reclaim ownership of these assets after it repays Ukraine  making the Reparations Loan temporary and reversible.Black Friday Sale: Unlimited insight. A limited-time offer.

SUBSCRIBE AND SAVEAs we previously argued  there is no risk of this being perceived as “confiscation.” None of the adverse effects that critics of immobilization and the ERA program predicted materialized. The euro is still second only to the dollar  and European financial institutions are a safe haven for investors across the world.While Russia has created the most serious security crisis in Europe since WWII’s end  trampling on international law and norms  its assets have been enjoying the protection of European institutions. But in any just world  one cannot have it both ways. One cannot attack Europe with GPS jamming  arson  sabotage  cyberwarfare  and disinformation campaigns – all orchestrated by Russian military intelligence – while enjoying the protection of European financial and legal institutions.If there ever were a time to tighten the screws on Russia  this is it. With oil and gas revenues down sharply  Russia is finding it harder and harder to pay for its meatgrinder war. Meanwhile  defense expenditures are rising  and high inflation is severely hurting Russian consumers.As a result of US secondary sanctions  India’s largest conglomerate halted Russian oil imports. Four major Chinese state oil companies have also signaled that they will refrain from buying Russian oil in the short term. China and India together account for about 85% of Russian oil sales  and a loss of these markets would have a severe impact on the Russian war effort. It is thus no surprise that Russia is rushing to force an end to the war on favorable terms.To share residual risk of the Reparations Loan  Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has demanded guarantees from other EU states that Belgium will not be liable for any successful award to the Russian Federation. Thus  each member state is to guarantee a share of the loan (based on gross national income).De Wever’s concerns are ungrounded. Given the grave violations of the United Nations Charter and the scale of Russian war crimes  there is no path to a successful arbitration or award to Russia that Belgium would have to repay. The immobilization happened because of EU law  and the European Council already limited the enforcement of any potential awards in 2014  in response to Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine  when Russia illegally annexed Crimea.Even so  if loan guarantees from EU member states are what is required to clear this hurdle  they should be provided to the necessary extent. Since Belgium is not at risk  there is no risk for guarantee providers. Furthermore  European countries should terminate their bilateral investment treaties with Russia – something they should have done long ago. Russia has already effectively done this by taking over so many European companies.As many European leaders acknowledge  Europe (including the United Kingdom and Norway) must be able to defend itself. Providing a Reparations Loan to Ukraine is a forceful step in this direction that Europeans can take without American involvement.It would be morally wrong not to pursue this option. Russia is culpable for the carnage it has wrought in Ukraine. A reparations loan would bring a modicum of justice  although the amount represents only a small fraction of the damage to physical infrastructure Russia has caused  to say nothing of the harm caused to millions of Ukrainians. An entire generation will carry the trauma with them for the rest of their lives.The Reparations Loan is not only about justice. It is about survival. To defend Ukraine is to defend Europe. Europe must overcome its fear of exercising power if it is to withstand the clear  present  and deadly threat emanating from Moscow.,negative,0.0,0.33,0.66,mixed,0.08,0.2,0.72,True,English,"['Russia', 'War', 'Ukraine', 'Four major Chinese state oil companies', 'Big Bet Slavoj Žižek', 'Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) program', 'The AI Labor Shock', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'recent EU Council meeting', 'Getty Images Free Trade', 'Russian central bank assets', 'European Central Bank', 'Peace Benn Steil', 'Getty Images Mamdani', 'incoming democratic-socialist mayor', 'next two years', 'original strategic goals', 'AAA-rated Commission bonds', 'AAA-rated ECB deposits', 'Russian military intelligence', 'Russian oil imports', 'Belgian financial institution', 'serious security crisis', 'US secondary sanctions', '€45 billion loan envelope', 'Western financial institutions', 'Black Friday Sale', 'many European leaders', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European financial institutions', 'World War II', 'ERA program', 'EU countries', 'European institutions', 'Russian casualties', 'Russian consumers', 'US involvement', 'global security', 'financial support', 'many lives', 'legal institutions', 'European Union', 'European jurisdictions', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Reparations Loan', 'forceful step', 'NEW YORK', 'fourth anniversary', 'powerful steps', 'long way', 'Eric Feferberg', 'Noreena Hertz', 'latest wave', 'disproportionate impact', 'female workers', 'Cheng Xin', 'Andres Kudacki', 'American politics', 'coming days', 'civilian infrastructure', 'power generation', 'distribution systems', 'water systems', 'enormous costs', 'other financing', 'bigger invader', 'virtual standstill', 'fiercest fighting', 'interest-paying securities', 'G7 countries', 'underlying assets', 'practical terms', 'Unlimited insight', 'limited-time offer', 'new subscription', 'expert commentary', 'exclusive features', 'PS Quarterly', 'independent media', 'safe haven', 'international law', 'GPS jamming', 'disinformation campaigns', 'gas revenues', 'high inflation', 'largest conglomerate', 'short term', 'meatgrinder war', 'real difference', 'full-scale invasion', 'adverse effects', 'defense expenditures', 'little interest', 'Norway', 'choice', 'Ukraine', 'direction', 'Europeans', 'ground', 'army', 'future', 'Women', 'automation', 'globalization', 'solution', 'homes', 'heating', 'need', 'reconstruction', 'addition', 'economy', 'loss', 'devastated', 'territories', 'populations', 'mines', 'February', 'October', 'loans', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'share', 'account', 'amount', 'destruction', 'principle', 'ownership', 'access', 'SUBSCRIBE', 'SAVE', 'risk', 'confiscation', 'None', 'critics', 'immobilization', 'dollar', 'investors', 'WWII', 'norms', 'protection', 'arson', 'sabotage', 'cyberwarfare', 'screws', 'result', 'India', 'China']",2025-11-28,2025-11-29,project-syndicate.org

In a letter to European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen seen b…,'I will never commit Belgium to sustain on its own the risks and exposures ' De Wever wrote - Copyright Belga/AFP NICOLAS MAETERLINCKBelgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever has called an EU plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine “fundamentally wrong”  throwing further doubt on a push to agree the move next month.In a letter to European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen seen by AFP Friday  De Wever pushed back strongly on the initiative and urged against venturing “into unchartered legal and financial waters”.The EU executive and multiple member states  are pressing for the bloc to tap immobilised Russian central bank assets to provide Kyiv with a 140-billion-euro ($162 billion) loan to plug looming budget black holes.Belgium is the key voice on the issue as it hosts international deposit organisation Euroclear  where the vast bulk of the assets are held.De Wever has repeatedly said the plan could leave his country facing crippling legal and financial reprisals from Moscow — and called for cast-iron guarantees from other EU countries that they will share the risk.“I will never commit Belgium to sustain on its own the risks and exposures ” he wrote in the four-page letter.He said he would only agree to the scheme at a crunch EU leaders’ summit on December 18 if binding guarantees “are delivered and signed by member states at the time of decision”.– ‘Intense work’ –De Wever’s letter comes as von der Leyen has promised to come up with legal texts soon laying out the exact proposed structure of the scheme.EU officials have asserted that the risks for Belgium of a successful legal challenge are small — an argument rebutted by the straight-talking De Wever.“Let me use the analogy of a plane crash: aircraft are the safest way of transportation and the chances of a crash are low  but in the event of a crash the consequences are disastrous ” he said.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was in contact with De Wever and was pressing for an agreement.“I understand his concerns  he has good arguments but we also have good arguments about reaching our common goal ” he said.“We are looking for a joint solution with the Belgian state and also with Euroclear so that we can decide on this within the EU with the widest consensus possible.”Clamour to harness the Russian assets has grown in the EU after a US plan to stop the war in Ukraine that emerged last week suggested the assets should be unfrozen.Proponents argue that if the bloc does not act now to use the money  then it risks losing control of it under a potential US-backed peace deal.The proposed EU “reparations loan” envisages that Ukraine would only pay back the funds once Russia had coughed up for the damages inflicted by its invasion.In the face of Belgian opposition to the plan  von der Leyen has laid out other options to keep financing Kyiv  including EU countries taking out joint borrowing.But the commission has warned that those options would prove more costly for member states at a time when many are struggling with stretched national budgets.An EU spokeswoman said that “intense work” was going on to try to hammer out a solution.“What we are trying to do is to really make sure that the concerns that have been expressed  notably by Belgium and the prime minister  are addressed in a satisfactory manner ” she said.,negative,0.01,0.49,0.5,negative,0.0,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['Belgian PM', 'Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'looming

However  investment in supporting our brands and in the quality of our Champagnes enables us to maintain a high level of operating margin  above that recorded in the years prior to the Covid period.The Laurent-Perrier Group is thus maintaining its value-driven strategy  consistently relying on the quality of its Champagnes  the strength of its brands  the commitment of its teams  and the controlled management of its distribution.""Change in revenue :During the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025  the champagne market recorded a -1.5% decline in volumes shipped compared with the prior year. Over the same period  the Group achieved a +2.6% increase in sales volumes compared with the first half of the previous financial year.Over the first nine months of the calendar year  the champagne market was down -1.4%  while the Group’s sales were up +8.9%  which does not  however  indicate the likely trend in revenue for the full financial year.In this less favourable environment  the strength of the Group’s brands and the quality of its Champagnes continued to support its value-driven strategy  resulting in a price-mix effect of +1.6% over the half-year  together with a +2.6% volume effect.Consolidated revenue for the first half (champagne sales) therefore amounted to €133.3 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :In the first half of 2025-2026  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in supporting its brands and in commercial development. These investments in enhancing the value of sales underpin the long-term strength of the brands. The Group’s operating margin reached 27.5% at current exchange rates. Net profit attributable to the Group amounted to €23.1 million at current exchange rates  down -8.7%  and represented 17.2% of consolidated revenue.Changes in operating cash flow and financial structure:The improvement in working capital (with the increase in inventories offset by higher trade creditors and lower other current assets) led to an improvement in operating cash flow  which stood at -€4.7 million compared with -€39.2 million at 30 September 2024.The interim consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2025 confirms the robustness of the Group’s financial position. Equity attributable to the Group amounted to €640.4 million  and net debt (*) stood at €236.8 million  including €43.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. The gearing ratio remains at an excellent level  at 0.37 at 30 September 2025 compared with 0.35 at 31 March 2025.(*) Net debt: non-current financial and other liabilities + current financial liabilities – cash and cash equivalents.Outlook :The published results for the first half cannot be extrapolated to the full 2025-2026 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical environment and the economic situation in several of the Group’s key markets call for considerable caution regarding the outlook for the coming months.The Laurent-Perrier Group continues to implement its business plan with vigilance and confidence  and is maintaining the course of its value-driven strategy  which is built on four pillars:A single business: The production and sale of top-of-the-range ChampagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distribution.Laurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

The man is dry and uninteresting as a political persona—whether he’s good company over raki I don’t know. But what he did yesterday is indicative that  as a politician  he is simply indefinable. So  PASOK posted yesterday morning a collage photo showing Kyriakos Mitsotakis next to the famous “Frapé ” known in everyday life as Giorgos Xylouris of OPEKEPE  with a title above the collage: “Mr. Xylouris is the best man of Kyriakos Mitsotakis.” When Androulakis himself realized that his party had made a crude blunder with this post  instead of apologizing or at least… burying it to put an end to the matter  what do you think he did? He took a 2004 article from a local newspaper (Crete) which had a wide-format report with photo and headline informing the public that “Konstantinos Mitsotakis married  on Friday 11 June 2004 in Crete  Manolis Xylouris ” and submitted it to Parliament as evidence. Now  how the nonexistent relationship of Kyriakos Mitsotakis in 2025 is connected with Manolis Xylouris  brother of “Frapé ” whom the late Konstantinos Mitsotakis married 21 years ago  you tell me. Xylouris may be “Frapé ” but when it comes to “frappés ” Androulakis takes the prize.Eurogroup – The candidate PierreThis afternoon the candidacies for the presidency of the Eurogroup are submitted. One of them is Greek—the Minister of Economy and Finance  Kyriakos Pierrakakis. Another one is considered certain  that of the Belgian Finance Minister  who belongs to the European People’s Party  while one is also expected from the Socialist Party  from Spain. I’m told that today  as the process begins  we may also have two or three more from smaller parties. The votes are 20  just as many as the member states  and the process will conclude in about two weeks. Let me say that our candidacy appears—and is—more attractive than the Belgian one  because quite simply Greece has the most recent success story in its economy and Pierre enjoys the most goodwill. But the match still has a long road ahead; it has only just begun. I note that yesterday the EPP president Weber came to Athens and had dinner with Mitsotakis. They must have talked about something…The Budget and the “gas pedal” for the Recovery FundLet me take you to yesterday’s Cabinet meeting  where there was considerable discussion about the Budget  which will enter Parliament in a few days. What was emphasized is the 98% increase in investments from 2019 to 2026  which means that the pie is growing and the state’s revenues and job positions are increasing. Also  in response to the argument about why more money isn’t given to society instead of repaying the Memorandum debts earlier  the answer is that such a thing is not allowed by the expenditure ceilings set by the Commission. I also hear that K.M issued one last but clear warning to his ministers to speed up the milestones connected to the Recovery Fund  emphasizing that it is forbidden for any of the pending projects not to be completed. With all that this implies for the evaluation of ministries and ministers.Balance for the Collective AgreementsAnother topic discussed in the Cabinet was the announcement of the reinstatement of Collective Agreements. Kerameos briefed in detail  and everyone agreed that even the image of the social partners together was very important. Of course  in the discussion that followed  many opinions were heard  as some ministers pointed out that balance is required  especially for small and medium-sized enterprises  so that we don’t end up with closures and a new wave of inflation due to a disproportionate increase in labor costs. I hear that K.M. announced that there will be filters and safety valves  especially regarding the issue of post-expiration validity and the extension of Collective Agreements.For lamb chops at KaravitisYesterday the message reached the ND MPs who serve on the Committee on Economic Affairs  whom Mitsotakis will host next Thursday. The meeting was set at “Karavitis” in Pangrati  which has incomparable lamb chops and nice burgers—a classic old taverna of Pangrati. The order is set for 19:30  so that K.M. can arrive right after his obligations at Maximos Mansion  and I foresee that  aside from the Budget  there will also be discussion about Tsipras’s book  which will have been presented the previous day. In general  note that K.M.’s contacts with the “blue” MPs will become more frequent.Desperate for a time limit (“cutter”)A wave of desperation has spread among the MPs who serve on the Inquiry Committee for OPEKEPE  since in recent days a steady member of the proceedings has been Zoe Konstantopoulou  as she is entitled as a party leader. And while due to the time limit in the Plenary she is now precise and respectful of the allotted times  in the Inquiry Committee—where there is no time limit—she goes all out  while also clashing with the Presidium that attempts to cut her microphone. Thus many MPs are asking for the time limit to be introduced in Committees as well  with the Parliament’s services responding that such a thing is not feasible  even for technical reasons.Mission accomplishedMany doubted that the government would pay the advance subsidy to producers at the end of the month  but it has been set in motion. What’s critical is that beyond the payment  an important reform is being promoted that changes the subsidy system. And here is the crucial part from yesterday’s announcements by Chatzidakis (who worked extensively with Brussels)  Tsiaras  and Pitsilis of AADE: emphasis is placed on audits  hence the amount is 25% smaller than in 2024  but the money will not be lost  as honest farmers will receive the difference through a new allocation.Qualified opinion for ERTIn the latest balance sheet of ERT that was recently published  the auditor states a “Basis for qualified opinion” concerning the amount of revenue from the broadcasting fee and the adequacy of the provision for covering losses from non-collection of claims from the broadcasting fee. Specifically  it is stated: “It was not possible to gather sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to verify: (a) the exact amount of revenue from the broadcasting fee under Law 4173/2013  which amounts to €228.06 million  an amount which the Company records based on the clearings of electricity providers and the accrual principle  and (b) the adequacy of the formed provision of €60.4 million for covering losses from non-collection of claims from the broadcasting fee totalling €126.1 million.” Fortunately  with the recently passed Marinakis law for ERT  an end is put to this mess.Praude versus HELEX in a legal “bras de fer”We have mentioned before lawyer Massimo Malvestio  who is emerging as one of the most successful fund managers in Europe  managing Praude Asset Management Limited. The investment company  based in Valletta  Malta  carefully built a large position (9.15% of the voting rights) in HELEX  awaiting developments with Euronext. Reliable information indicates that Euronext representatives met with Malvestio to secure his participation in the share-exchange process. They even left the meeting with the impression that Praude would contribute positively to the effort. Ultimately  as officially announced  Praude Asset Management Limited informed the Athens Stock Exchange that it now controls—indirectly—9.15% of HELEX’s voting rights. This means that when the exchange deadline expired  Malvestio chose to remain a shareholder of the Athens Stock Exchange. Praude has in the past demonstrated its capabilities in the notorious “legal arbitrage ” implementing investment strategies that exploit legal and regulatory asymmetries. It is worth noting that the Hermes Linder Fund of the Praude group has shown a performance history of 600% since its inception and ranks in the top 1% of Small Cap funds in Europe. Obviously  Praude is preparing to use legal arguments to increase the price it will receive for the 9.15%. The squeeze-out that Euronext is preparing means compulsory acquisition of the remaining shareholders. Praude will seek a better price and will likely rely on the argument of an “in-motion change of the institutional framework” to turn its minority stake into a lever of added value.Intralot…The UK gambling sector knew that a tax increase was imminent  but expectations were that it would be relatively mild. They did not expect the high 40%  and this triggered sell-offs in all the sector’s shares  pulling Intralot down as well. People panicked from the strong pressure on the stock to the point that they leaked  from the afternoon  the announcements they were going to make the next morning with the results  so that the market would learn the company’s official assessment and mount a defense (as indeed happened) in yesterday’s session. Moreover  information suggests that retail investors did not sell and that the -17% in the stock was mainly caused by market professionals. In the information memorandum for the public offer to Intralot shareholders  there is no reference to future risks  since that obligation applies only to prospectuses.…and the billA barrage of questions  as expected  came during yesterday’s Intralot teleconference  as analysts sought more details on the impact of the increased tax on online gaming in the UK. The new CEO  Robeson Reeves  asked analysts to focus on page 4 of the presentation  where the estimated impacts up to 2027 are shown. From there it appears that if the measures the company will take—€50 million in 2026 and €30 million in 2027—bear fruit  operating profitability will be €422 million compared to an initial estimate of €435 million  and for the following year (2027) the forecast is operating profitability of €449 million. Overall  the estimated impact from the increased taxation will amount to €46 million in 2026 and €31 million in 2027. The company head reiterated that the level of taxation was higher than expected  predicted that in the new landscape the strongest will survive  and announced that Bally’s will move toward increasing its stake  while share buybacks are also on the table.Morgan Stanley with Mytilinaios  Rigas  and Stathopoulos on geopoliticsThe time for the 4th Greek Investment Conference—held every year in London by Morgan Stanley and the Athens Stock Exchange—comes next Monday  December 1st. This year the interest is expected to be even greater than usual. The conference opens with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis  as last year  which alone gives weight; but right afterward follows a discussion on geopolitics with super participants: Evangelos Mytilinaios of Metlen  Mathios Rigas of Energean  and Nikos Stathopoulos of BC Partners. An interesting discussion is expected during a period of great interest for energy and investments in our wider region. Moderator will be Massimiliano Ruggieri  Head of EMEA Investment Banking at MS.New members on Viva’s BoardThere is mobility at VIVA  as two more members were added to the Board of Directors  making it nine members. On the Board  where G. Antypas remains president and Ch. Karonis CEO  now also serve John Coulter—selected by JP Morgan as an Independent Non-Executive Member—and Theodoros Katsas as a Non-Executive Member.The dynamic comeback of Peter GAmid the tumult of the VLCCs that steal the limelight  the Greek players in product tankers seem to be moving more… quietly  with one exception: Peter Georgiopoulos  who is returning to the forefront of sale-and-purchase activity with renewed force. United Overseas Group–UOG  which has already “offloaded” three MRs this year  is now preparing to add a fourth to its fleet  the UOG Syros. In fact  it is said to be closing the deal at USD 21.5 million  one million above market estimates. Rumor has it in the corridors that “Peter knows when to enter and even better when to exit.” The fact that the vessel has passed its inspections probably helped  but the market climate plays an even bigger role. At the same time  other Greek shipowners appear more cautious  leaving the MR dance floor to the Danes  the Scandinavians  and Middle Eastern funds. Greek MR owners are “measuring” their moves while Torm  Maersk  and UAE-based companies push prices higher with impressive en-bloc deals. And while the Greeks choose a low profile  China’s CDB Leasing is reported to have received USD 130 million for five MRs with Trafigura charters  reminding everyone that international appetite for product tankers has truly awakened. Perhaps  in the end  the Greeks are waiting for the next more favorable market phase. Until then  the only one moving with confidence is Georgiopoulos  keeping Greek MR tankers at the center of attention—even if the others prefer to play defense.Poly V. Hadjiioannou’s manualOn Wall Street  where narratives often overshadow numbers  Safe Bulkers once again gave the impression of a company operating with cold discipline  almost mechanically. This is no coincidence. It reflects the philosophy of shipowner Poly V. Hadjiioannou  who does not chase impressions but timing. The background behind this year’s sale of two aging kamsarmaxes is rooted precisely in this logic: when the market rises  you don’t indulge emotional attachment. You sell. And President Loukas Barmparis said it plainly: “When the market moves upward  you have the opportunity to sell at higher prices.” The philosophy is that you do not resist the cycle—you use it. Fund executives in New York like to say that PVH runs fleet renewal “like a portfolio manager.” The company has not simply offloaded two old Japanese bulkers; it is replacing them with a newbuilding program of 18 ships  progressing at a pace that exudes certainty  not risk. Already 12 are in the water  while four more kamsarmaxes are on track for 2026. And there lies another side of his philosophy: while he changes the fleet  he does not change the company’s character. Low dividend  steady repayments  loans linked not to promises but measurable environmental performance. The new USD 75 million sustainability-linked facility (a bank loan whose interest rate depends on sustainability indicators) is exactly the kind of move institutional investors appreciate.Tension in Washington  concern among shipownersLet me take you to the other side of the Atlantic  to the USA  where shipping has focused its attention lately following geopolitical developments and changes to the energy map. The developments surrounding Senator Mark Kelly—a symbolic figure for American naval strength and architect of key legislative initiatives to revive the U.S. shipbuilding industry—have introduced an air of worry in Washington. The Pentagon’s warning that he may be recalled to active duty to stand trial  following the video in which former military personnel refused to obey allegedly illegal orders  is creating concern about the plan to rejuvenate the U.S. merchant marine. Greek shipowners are watching closely  not out of curiosity but because the Ocean Belt initiative dubbed “U.S. Shipping Revival” directly affects geoeconomic balances: investment flows  cargo routes  shipbuilding schedules  competitive conditions. Kelly  together with Republican Todd Young  is behind the most ambitious bill ever advanced in the modern American maritime scene: the SHIPS for America Act. A plan promising a strategic commercial fleet of 250 ships  mandatory carriage of government cargo exclusively under the U.S. flag  and the gradual “repatriation” of part of the cargo transported from China. The question is whether a country rediscovering its shipbuilding identity can change the rules of the game—or whether the political storm will halt the effort before even the first new ship is launched. The picture becomes even murkier after the recent suspension of the targeted Section 301 port fees  the government’s main pressure tool on the Chinese shipbuilding system. Their one-year postponement  as part of the Trump–Xi agreement  leaves the U.S. shipping support program without its commercial backbone. Unions speak of self-sabotage  analysts of a “strategic mistake ” and R&D of a new period of uncertainty.Titan’s new “Ukrainian” dreamsTitan’s market capitalization has surpassed EUR 3.5 billion  having gained one-fifth of its value in the past quarter. Sufficiently internationalized with a presence on major stock exchanges  it is seeking a share of the new major market emerging from the upcoming reconstruction of Ukraine. Many even whisper that Titan has set in motion the creation of a cement plant in the Black Sea region. For now  the Group’s management remains committed to its five-year strategic plan aiming to close 2029 with EUR 4 billion in turnover and EUR 1 billion in operating profitability. Meanwhile  executives of the Group point out that “the cash register is full ” allowing them to seize market opportunities for new investments and acquisitions.Stock market: Another profitable month comes to a closeWith the General Index at 2 099.8 points  November closes today with gains of +5.25% and an average daily transaction value of EUR 267.8 million. To find such high average daily value  one must look back to the glory days of October–November 2009. Last month  October  broke the undefeated streak of 11 consecutive rising months  as it ended in negative territory  but November brought the market back into a festive expectancy for a year-end rally. Without American support  yesterday’s trading activity was subdued at EUR 133.08 million  with EUR 10.12 million in block trades. In a Thanksgiving-like mood yesterday  only those with absolute need were selling  as buyers were scarce. Alpha (-1.95% at €3.56) seems to have had impatient sellers  as did Eurobank (-1.5% at €3.47). National Bank  from which we expect announcements about its partnership with a major Insurance Group—NN  according to the market—slipped -0.48% to €13.54  and Piraeus  which closed the matter of Ethniki Asfalistiki  fell to €7.12 (-0.97%). Metlen (+2.09% at €45) continues its revenge run  while GEK TERNA (+1.55% at €24.88) soars to unprecedented heights. Also standing out due to water shortage issues was EYDAP (+1.7% at €7.16). Noteworthy from yesterday’s session is the stock of Intralot  which followed the rebound of other global companies in its sector (+7.07%)  but still remains below €1 (€0.985) with high trading volume.Business landing in EgyptWith 107 million inhabitants  according to the official estimate for 2025  Egypt is the most populous (though not the richest) Arab country. Representatives of 20 Greek businesses will visit Cairo on Monday as part of a business mission organized by SEV  EVEA  SEVE  and Enterprise Greece. The entrepreneurs cover many sectors—from technology and pharmaceuticals to construction and defense. Leading the mission will be Deputy Foreign Minister Haris Theoharis  who will speak at a Business Forum in Cairo. Preparation for the visit began last July with the “Discover Egypt” event at SEV’s offices. There  we learned Egypt’s priorities: Energy (the GREGY interconnection for the transfer of green energy)  infrastructure (where Greek construction firms have a technical edge)  and high technology  since Egypt’s relatively low-cost and educated workforce offers incentives for outsourcing.The U.S. moves toward deregulation for banks—panic in EuropeAfter the 2008 crisis—remembered by all as the Lehman Brothers and subprime mortgage crisis that turned into securities and contaminated the global financial system—banking oversight rules worldwide became extremely strict. Capital adequacy rules  supervision  and obligations made a banker’s job particularly difficult. The Financial Times reveal that Trump has decided to relax these rules; the UK is considering it  and Frankfurt is reacting with panic. The new American head of Banking Supervision  Michelle Bowman  has already begun loosening regulations by freeing up USD 2.6 trillion in lending capacity and establishing rules allowing American banks to keep fewer emergency cash reserves. Unsurprisingly  this development excites Wall Street traders. In Europe—first in London—there are banks officially “leaking” their intention to move their headquarters to the U.S. Yet many believe that with the “bubbles” present in nearly every market  the relaxation of bank supervision rules is simply the spark that may trigger the next major financial crisis.Europe’s coldest country is heated by Data CentersIn a few days  on St. Nicholas Day for us  Finland celebrates its Independence Day  marking its secession from Russia in 1917. Today  Finland stands out in Europe for its innovative initiatives across many fields (industry  education  healthcare  etc.). The country’s latest achievement is the “thermal utilization” of Data Centers. These “Data Centers”—housing servers of Google  Microsoft  and Amazon—produce enormous amounts of heat. Traditionally  this heat is wasted and released into the atmosphere. Finland  however  has found a way to capitalize on this “waste.” Instead of complex electric heating systems or conventional fuels  Helsinki “loads” the underground heat produced by servers directly into the urban heating network. This reduces the capital’s dependence on imported fossil fuels. For their part  Google  Microsoft  and Amazon present their Finnish data centers as climate-neutral  even though their operation consumes as much electricity as a medium-sized city. The secret lies in pricing: the tech giants sell the heat they produce at preferential rates—much cheaper than traditional energy—while simultaneously gaining tax incentives and expansion permits.A Turkish defense investment record of USD 1.5 billionAselsan  listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange  has announced a grand investment of USD 1.5 billion for the strategic “Steel Dome” program. On a massive 6 500-acre site in the Oğulbey area of Ankara  the largest industrial investment in the history of the Turkish defense industry is being created. A new technological hub for the “steel dome ” the ambitious national multi-layered air- and missile-defense system of Turkey.
