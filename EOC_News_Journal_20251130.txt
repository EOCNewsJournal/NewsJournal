(I assume this is a highly optimized and dialed-in thing  but I’m still curious.)It is an all vegetable based protein. So predominantly pea protein with a few other things. I use almond “milk” as the liquid. The smoothie ingredients are 1/2 a frozen avocado (I”m not allowed bananas)  frozen dragon fruit chunks  the protein powder  monk fruit powder (I use the high end stuff that doesn’t have sugar alcohols)  dark cocoa powder  green tea/matcha powder  mushroom supplement powder  marine collagen  a pinch of pink Himalayan salt  frozen strawberries  almond butter  and frozen blueberries. I get about a 60 to 64 ounce smoothie once I’m done. This is tailored to my system and needs. I can’t eat read meat because of toxic exposure in Iraq  so that’s why I use the vegetable based protein powder and the marine collagen not the bovine based collagen. I’m not allowed bananas or dairy outside of 0% fat Greek yogurt and small amounts of goat cheese (usually feta crumbled for my salads). And I can’t have refined sugar or carbohydrates other than limited amounts of rice or oats and a limited amount of wasa crackers per week.The big news today is that Andriy Yermak  who had been the head of the Presidential Office and  in most ways  Zelenskyy’s right hand man  has resigned as the corruption investigation reached him.The official website of the President of Ukraine has published Presidential Decree №868/2025 on the dismissal of A. Yermak from the position of Head of the Presidential Office  dated 28 November 2025. [image or embed] — Tatarigami (@tatarigami.bsky.social) November 28  2025 at 10:51 AMFrom The Kyiv Independent:Andriy Yermak  head of the President’s Office  submitted his resignation following searches by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) at his premises earlier on Nov. 28  President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. Yermak is being investigated by the NABU in a case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom  the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky’s presidency. Eight suspects have been charged in the Energoatom case  and Timur Mindich  a close associate of the president  is allegedly the ringleader. “There will be a reset of the President’s Office ” Zelensky said. “Andriy Yermak  the head of the President’s Office  has submitted his resignation. I am grateful to Andriy for always presenting Ukraine’s position in the negotiation track exactly as it needed to be.” Zelensky said he wanted to “avoid rumors and speculation.” “As for the new head of the (President’s) Office  tomorrow I will hold consultations with those who could lead this institution ” he added. A decree on Yermak’s dismissal has been published on the official website of the President’s Office. Zelensky also commented on who would represent Ukraine instead of Yermak  who was appointed to lead a delegation in the U.S.-Ukraine talks in Switzerland on Nov. 23. He said that the Ukrainian delegation in the peace talks would include the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council  the head of the General Staff  the Foreign Ministry  and intelligence officials. Rustem Umerov  secretary of the National Security and Defense Council  is also under investigation in the Energoatom corruption case  but has not been charged so far. Two other officials implicated in the corruption scandal  Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk  were fired on Nov. 19. They have not been charged yet.More at the link.There are already follow on effects:The Kyiv Independent has the details:The Czech foundation Gift for Putin will no longer buy Flamingo cruise missiles from Ukrainian weapons maker Fire Point due to connections to a recent corruption scandal  local media reported. “We collected the money very quickly  but serious doubts arose that it would not go to the product for which the collection was made. So we did not go to them and now we are looking for a suitable alternative ” Dalibor Dědek told Idnes  as reported on Nov. 28. The decision apparently came after Dědek received new information from Ukrainian military intelligence  HUR. Another leader of the initiative  Martin Ondráček  also pointed to these concerns. “We understand that there is a certain amount of reluctance to spend money on this particular missile  because there is a real suspicion that the manufacturer is connected to people around Andriy Yermak ” he told the publication. The organization is reportedly seeking other weapons manufacturers to receive the donation. The news follows reports on the morning of Nov. 28 of searches of the property of Andriy Yermak  head of the President’s Office by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine  or NABU. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Yermak’s resignation by the evening. The searches reportedly relate to a corruption investigation centered around Timur Mindich  a businessman and longtime associate of Zelensky’s  including as co-owner of the president’s former TV studio  Kvartal 95. NABU filed charges against Mindich weeks ago alleging massive theft from funds meant to build defenses for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. In August  the Kyiv Independent broke the news of a corruption investigation into Fire Point. The company has worked to stave off negative press since then  announcing a host of ambitious new ballistic missiles and space projects and bringing on former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who served under President Donald Trump  as an adviser.Ukraine has once again proved its seriousness in the fight against corruption — after the country’s independent NABU and SAPO conducted searches in Yermak’s place  he is out now. A country must be judged not by the problems it faces  but by the response and actions. — Olena Halushka (@halushka.bsky.social) November 28  2025 at 11:31 AMHere is President Zelenskyy’s address from earlier today. Video below  English transcript after the jump.Russia Is Eager for Ukraine to Make Mistakes; We Won’t Make Any – Address by the President Dear Ukrainians! Just now – over the past few days – I have already held nearly twenty conversations with our partners  and every single one of them says the same thing: we are impressed by how Ukraine is holding on under the current pressure  by how Ukraine keeps fighting in pursuit of peace for its people  and in truth  for everyone in Europe  at the very least in Europe. Today  I spoke with the President of Finland. Alex briefed me on what Russia conveyed  both formally and informally  and on the conditions Russia is putting forward. And now we are preparing for a meeting with the American side to discuss the steps needed to make peace a reality. And to ensure it is a dignified peace. And when all attention is focused on diplomacy and on defending ourselves in this war  we need internal strength. Internal strength is the foundation of our external unity and of our relations with the world. And for that internal strength to exist  there must be no reasons to get distracted by anything other than defending Ukraine. I want no one to have any questions for Ukraine. So today  these are the next internal decisions. First. There will be a reset of the Office of the President of Ukraine. The Head of the Office  Andriy Yermak  has submitted his resignation. I am grateful to Andriy for always representing Ukraine’s position on the negotiation track exactly as it should be represented. It has always been a patriotic position. But I want to eliminate any rumors and speculation. As for the new Head of the Office – tomorrow I will hold consultations with those who may lead this institution. Talks will take place soon  with our representatives present – including the Chief of the General Staff  officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council  and our intelligence. And when we all face such an external challenge – war – we must remain strong internally. One hundred percent of our strength will be focused squarely on defending Ukraine. Everyone must now act in this very way – in the interests of our state – and defend our state. This principle remains unchanged. Meetings with the American side will be held very soon. Second. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. I expect that Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko  together with Members of Parliament  through dialogue and unity  will ensure three things for Ukraine. Most importantly – adopting the budget for 2026  which means ensuring our state’s ability to defend itself  to fund our defense  to provide all social payments  and to sustain the resilience we need. This is what people need. I also expect candidates to be proposed for the Ministers of Energy and Justice. The current ministers must be evaluated in a way that allows absolutely clear conclusions – whether these officials meet the challenges of both this winter and this war. Third. I spoke with the Security Service of Ukraine  asking them to carry out their own assessment of the situation within the law enforcement system and in the regions. Reports will follow soon  then my conclusions  and then the decisions. Too much negativity is coming from the regions. We agreed that the Security Service will provide me with the necessary information promptly. And of course – the army. Our warriors are heroes. Our warriors are destroying the enemy  and this is the foundation of our ability to build diplomacy. There are issues that should have been resolved long ago. The Commander-in-Chief  the General Staff  and Pavlo Palisa are already working on this  and for next week  I am preparing the relevant Staff meeting. Above all  we need a truly fair  rational distribution of personnel among brigades. The principles for doing this are already in place  and every combat brigade is talking about it. The decision will come. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine! I thank everyone who defends Ukraine now and always. I thank everyone who ensures that pressure is placed on Russia – on the cause of this war – and not on our state  not on our people  not on Ukrainians. Ukrainians must prevail. That is what matters most. Russia is eager for Ukraine to make mistakes. We won’t make any. Our work goes on. Our struggle goes on. We have no right to fall short  no right to retreat or turn on one another. If we lose our unity  we risk losing everything – ourselves  Ukraine  and our future. We must stand together. We must hold our ground. There is no other choice. There will never be another Ukraine. We defend Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!First Lady Zelenska visited a lyceum in Kyiv Oblast today.Olena Zelenska Foundation Equipped a Modern Shelter at a Hub Lyceum in the Kyiv Region and Launches the “Safe School” Project First Lady Olena Zelenska  together with her Foundation’s team  Ambassador of Austria to Ukraine Robert Müller  and Head of Building and Property Management Department of the Lower Austrian Government Christoph Reiter  visited one of the lyceums in Kaharlyk  Kyiv region. The Foundation restored and equipped an approximately 800-square-meter shelter within the lyceum building. Nearly 900 children attend the lyceum  one-third of whom commute daily from nearby villages. Olena Zelenska expressed her gratitude to the partners for their support – thanks to Lower Austria’s assistance  the renovated shelter now includes spaces for study and rest and is fully accessible for people with disabilities. Rescuers  police officers  and emergency medical specialists conduct training for students on mine safety  fire safety  road safety  and first aid. “Today  a school must be not just a protected building but a fully functional space for life – with warmth and light  hot meals  and the feeling of a familiar rhythm of the day. That is why  at the Foundation  we are gradually expanding our approach and working not only on shelters but also on other critically important elements of educational infrastructure ” the First Lady noted. According to the President’s wife  the Foundation is launching a new comprehensive project  Safe School. As part of this initiative  the lyceum in Kaharlyk will have its kitchen facilities modernized  including renovation of the kitchen and dining hall  installation of modern technological equipment  and upgrades to the furniture. After the modernization  the kitchen facilities will be able to provide balanced meals to an additional 400 children from five neighboring institutions. “We believe that even during wartime  children must be able to learn in safe  dignified  and comfortable conditions. This is exactly what our team works on every day – providing comprehensive support to educational institutions so that every child can grow in an environment that meets their needs and ensures their safety ” Olena Zelenska emphasized. Since last year  the Foundation has restored and equipped more than 30 shelters in schools and kindergartens across Kyiv  Poltava  Chernihiv  Mykolaiv  Dnipro  Odesa  Sumy regions and in Zaporizhzhia. In 2026  the restoration and equipping of at least 50 more shelters is planned.Georgia:A year ago today  Georgian Dream unleashed an unprecedented wave of repression against protesters — torture  beatings  mass arrests  and crushing fines.

Vance believed that Kyiv would not abandon Trump’s plan  prepared by Witkoff and Dmitriev  due to the corruption scandal  — The Atlantic. Trump is seeking to exploit Ukraine’s internal problems  while Russia is not relaxing its demands. [image or embed] — MAKS 25 👀🇺🇦 (@maks23.bsky.social) November 27  2025 at 4:58 AMFrom The Atlantic: (emphasis mine)The Gaza deal  which took effect on October 9  did not earn Trump the Nobel Peace Prize that he had coveted; it was awarded the following day to a dissident in Venezuela. But Israelis celebrated Trump as a peacemaker. During a speech at the Knesset on October 13  Trump promised that Witkoff and Kushner would soon turn their attention to ending the war in Ukraine. “I thought it would be easily settled ” Trump said. “But this came first  and we’ll get that one.” In reality  Witkoff had been trying for months to negotiate with Russia  and he had shown himself to be among Putin’s most eager listeners. When Witkoff first visited the Kremlin  in the spring  Trump expected the talks to be brief. “Steve had no idea about Russia  had no idea about Putin ” Trump recalled in his speech at the Knesset. “Didn’t know too much about politics  wasn’t that interested.” The meeting went on for five hours. “That’s a talent ” Trump said. From his seat in the audience  Witkoff beamed. The following day  he held a phone call with Putin’s chief adviser on foreign affairs  Yuri Ushakov  and proposed a way for the Russians to change Trump’s mind about Ukraine. “I’m even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal  just like we did in Gaza ” Witkoff told the Kremlin official  according to the transcript published by Bloomberg. The two envoys agreed that their presidents should speak on the phone in the next couple of days  before Zelensky’s planned visit to Washington  D.C.  at the end of that week. Putin and Trump held a phone call on October 16  and they agreed to organize a summit in Budapest to work toward a deal. When Zelensky arrived the next day at the Oval Office  he found Trump in no mood for his ideas of victory. The promised encirclement of Russian troops around Pokrovsk had not materialized. Instead  the Russians had continued advancing  sending small groups of soldiers to infiltrate the town and set up firing positions. Zelensky brought along another set of maps to explain the state of the fighting in that area  but Trump showed little interest. “It is time to stop the killing  and make a DEAL!” he wrote on Truth Social after that meeting. “No more shooting  no more Death  no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent.” The change in tone upset the Ukrainian delegates but did not surprise them. They had experienced such swings in Trump’s position before. The first Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelensky  at the end of February  had descended into a shouting match  leading the U.S. to suspend all military aid to Ukraine. About 10 days later  after Zelensky reaffirmed his desire to end the war  the White House resumed the flow of aid  and relations got back on track. The experience led the Ukrainians to adopt a new rule in their diplomacy: Never allow Trump to see Kyiv as an impediment to peace. “We’ll go anywhere ” the close aide to Zelensky said  affirming the president’s willingness to hold peace talks in whatever format Trump prefers. “Trilateral  bilateral  any proposals for a cease-fire rather than capitulation  we’ll accept it.” They also noticed a pattern in Trump’s attitude on Ukraine: It varied widely depending on which of his advisers were in the room. “Trump is like a weather vane. Whoever blows in his ear today  that’s the direction he turns ” the aide told me. “If he’s with Vance and Witkoff  it’s a different Trump.” Vice President J. D. Vance was fixated on making a deal to end the war at any cost  and he was especially keen to get it done before the midterm elections. But he was forced to share the Ukraine portfolio with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Since his days in the Senate  Rubio has taken a hard line on the need to limit the global influence of Russia and China  and he seemed far less trusting of his interlocutors in the Kremlin. For a peace deal to work  he believed that the U.S. needed to test Russia’s willingness to abide by the terms. He was more willing than others in the White House to solicit input from Zelensky’s team and ensure their consent to any agreement with the Russians. The Ukrainians were relieved to learn that Rubio had been put in charge of arranging Trump’s summit with Putin in Budapest. As part of the preparations  Rubio held a call on October 20 with his Russian counterpart  Sergei Lavrov  who rattled off a list of the Kremlin’s demands. The demands were so extreme that Rubio advised Trump not to move forward with the Budapest summit  and the White House canceled the trip. “I didn’t want to have a wasted meeting ” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I didn’t want to have a waste of time.” The pendulum was about to swing again. In response to the U.S. sanctions  the Kremlin dispatched one of its envoys  Kirill Dmitriev  an alumnus of Harvard and Goldman Sachs who had worked hard to build a rapport with Witkoff in particular. When they met for dinner at a hotel in Miami  Witkoff brought along Kushner  and the three of them continued their talks the next day at Witkoff’s home. A few days later  Dmitriev reported back to his boss in the Kremlin  Yuri Ushakov. The Americans  he said  wanted to see a list of Russian demands for ending the war. According to the transcript published by Bloomberg  Ushakov wanted to send the “maximum” conditions  adding  “Otherwise what’s the point.” Dmitriev agreed  promising that his contacts in the White House would likely accept whatever they received. “Let them make it like their own ” Dmitriev said. “I think they will not take our version entirely  but at least maximally close to it.” The document they drafted appears to have formed the basis for the 28-point plan  which Axios published on November 20  setting off a furious effort among Ukraine’s allies in Europe to understand its origins. One of the most odious terms in the plan concerned the eastern region of Donetsk  which Russia has tried and failed to conquer for years. The document states that this region “will be recognized as de facto Russian  including by the United States.” Witkoff has long called for Ukraine to give up its claim to this region and others that Russia occupies. “The Russians are de facto in control of these territories ” Witkoff told Tucker Carlson in March  after his first official visit to the Kremlin. “The question is: Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?” Witkoff raised the issue again in his talks with Dmitriev last month. “I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done ” he said  according to the transcript published by Bloomberg. “Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere.” Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill were outraged to find this suggestion in the 28-point plan. They pointed out that such an outcome would set a dangerous precedent by rewarding the aggressor. “Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world’s most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin ” GOP Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi  chair of the Armed Services Committee  said in a statement. “Any assurances provided to Putin should not reward his malign behavior or undermine the security of the United States or allies.” Vance  who played a pivotal role in pushing Zelensky to accept the 28-point plan  lashed out at its critics. “The political class is really angry that the Trump administration may finally bring a four year conflict in Eastern Europe to a close ” Vance said in a social-media post. “It disgusts me.” Another provision in the plan directly contradicted the efforts of European nations to pressure Russia. They have tried for months to use the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine sustain the war effort and repair the damage from Russian attacks. Instead  the plan called for $100 billion to be “invested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine.” Half of the profits from these investments would go to the United States  and Europe would unfreeze some of the other assets to be used for a “separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas.” Such provisions led some of Ukraine’s allies to suspect that the Russians had used the promise of financial gain to win over the Trump administration. The senior European diplomat told us that it looked like a “sausage in front of the American nose.” But Trump’s willingness to embrace the document had more to do with Ukraine’s weakness at the time. On November 10  investigators in Ukraine announced one of the biggest anti-corruption cases in the country’s history. Although Zelensky was not implicated in the scandal  Vance and other officials in the White House believed that it would leave the Ukrainians in no position to resist a peace deal. After a few more days of talks  negotiators from the U.S. and Ukraine came close to giving Trump what he wanted. Their talks in Geneva stripped out several of Russia’s long-standing demands. The next round of talks  in Abu Dhabi  ended with an announcement from Zelensky’s national security adviser  Rustem Umerov: The two sides had reached a “common understanding on the core terms of the agreement.” A U.S. official went further  declaring  “The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal. There are some minor details to be sorted out  but they have agreed to a peace deal.” One of these “minor details ” according to one person involved in the negotiations  happens to be the one that Zelensky would find hardest to accept. The provision would require Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the parts of the Donetsk region that it still controls  including Pokrovsk and the other eastern-bastion towns  which serve as a fortified wall against Russian advances. Giving up that territory would be tantamount to political suicide for Zelensky. “If he gives up one square kilometer ” his close aide told us  “that’ll be the main issue in any elections. Every opponent will hammer him for it until he cracks.” Even Witkoff seemed to recognize this problem all the way back in March  after his first visit to the Kremlin as a peace negotiator. He said in his interview with Carlson at the time that Zelensky would need to acknowledge the loss of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine as part of any deal to end the war. “Can Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this?” Witkoff asked. “This is the central issue in the conflict.”More at the link.It is not that Zelenskyy can survive politically  it is that no Ukrainian politician or leader of any sort who is not a Putin catspaw could accept what Witkoff  Jared  and Vance are pushing.Back to Ukraine.Earlier tonight:Currently at 5:47 AM local time in Ukraine/10:47 PM EST 2/3rds of Ukraine is back under air raid alert as drone swarms are moving east to west from Russia across Ukraine.Here’s tonight’s outgoing Ukrainian fires:Last week: Trump tells Zelensky to sign Dim-Wit plan (claimed to be US but actually basically Russian) by Thanksgiving (yesterday)  hints aid might be cut if he doesn’t.
