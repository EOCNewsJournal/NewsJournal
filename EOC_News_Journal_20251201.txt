The problem is how?The commission has proposed to do so by using €140 billion of Russian frozen assets held in the EU as collateral for interest-free loans to Kyiv  a suggestion decried by Russia as illegal confiscation. The EU has frozen some €210 billion Russian state assets of which around €185 billion are held at Euroclear  the Brussels-based central securities depository.The Belgian government continues to wield its veto against the proposal and – together with Euroclear – insists the measure will undermine market confidence in the security of European deposit institutions and push up the cost of borrowing. Belgium fears it will be vulnerable to Russian legal and other retaliation  and insists that the rest of the union must provide it with guarantees that they will share in any fallout.The Commission has structured what are now referred to as “reparation loans” so that  it argues  they do not constitute confiscation but borrowings against assets that will be repaid by Russia as part of reparations agreed in a peace deal  albeit that this is a somewhat dubious prospect.Alternative approaches  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested  include Member States themselves providing bilateral grants to Ukraine  or the union borrowing collectively for a new Ukraine debt fund . Both are non-runners  as she knows  for states already struggling with debt  the majority of which are suspicious of even the idea of extending the union’s post-Covid collective debt-raising exercise.It is hoped a deal on the loan can be agreed at the Brussels summit on December 18th. Member states in the interim must work to provide Belgium with the reassurances it needs  and to reshape the peace pact now proposed by Trump to strengthen Russian reparation obligations  along with other changes needed to underpin Ukraine and EU security.,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,True,English,"['The Irish Times view', 'EU support', 'Ukraine', 'deal', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'huge budget funding gap', 'Brussels-based central securities depository', 'Covid collective debt-raising exercise', '€210 billion Russian state assets', 'new Ukraine debt fund', 'European deposit institutions', 'Russian frozen assets', 'Russian reparation obligations', 'The Commission', 'Russian legal', 'reparation loans', 'one thing', 'concrete expression', 'interest-free loans', 'Belgian government', 'market confidence', 'other retaliation', 'dubious prospect', 'Alternative approaches', 'bilateral grants', 'Brussels summit', 'December 18th', 'peace pact', 'other changes', 'Member States', 'illegal confiscation', 'peace deal', 'EU leaders', 'EU security', 'solidarity', 'problem', 'collateral', 'Kyiv', 'suggestion', 'Euroclear', 'veto', 'proposal', 'measure', 'cost', 'borrowing', 'Belgium', 'union', 'guarantees', 'fallout', 'part', 'reparations', 'runners', 'majority', 'idea', 'interim', 'reassurances', 'Trump']",2025-11-30,2025-12-01,irishtimes.com

One after another  major international investment houses (such as Morgan Stanley  JP Morgan  UBS  HSBC  Bank of America  Wood and Company) are “voting” for Greece also for 2026.Reforms  growth prospects (a growth rate higher than the EU average for the sixth year)  and the recent energy and geopolitical upgrade of development are some of the factors creating fertile ground for attracting new investors to the country.The “weapons” of the Greek mission for attracting foreign investors consist of the following facts:The strong growth story of the Greek economy. The Greek economy has  at least for the next few years  a “clear runway” for growth under conditions of fiscal stability. The Greek economy will also be one of the fastest growing in the EU in 2026. For the sixth year this year  our country will have nearly double the growth rate compared to the rest of Europe.Fiscal stability. The trajectory of fiscal data is on a path of overperformance  supporting the scenario of a positive revision of the prospects of the Greek economy. At the same time  public debt is decreasing. International house Wood & Co sees a sharp decline in Greek debt from 154.1% in 2024 to 101.3% in 2030.A new chapter is opening for the Greek energy sector  with Greece’s role as a regional energy hub being upgraded following the signing of the agreement for the Vertical Energy Corridor. The country is becoming a crucial point for the import  transport and distribution of LNG to Europe. In this way  its role as an energy bridge from the USA to the European market is strengthened and established at the core of the European energy map.Recently  international house FTSE Russell upgraded  for September 2026  the Greek capital market from the category of Advanced Emerging Markets to Developed Markets.This move is expected to significantly expand the pool of international investors who will now be able to invest in the Greek market  attracting substantial capital inflows that track global Developed Market indices.With the acquisition of the Athens Stock Exchange by Euronext  the Greek stock market is moving to another level  allowing participants in Greek financial markets to join a network of more than 1 800 listed companies with a total market capitalization exceeding 6 trillion euros. The Athens Stock Exchange will soon become part of Euronext  a market now twice the size of London’s capital market (approximately 12 billion daily).The profitability of listed companies supports stock valuations. The apparent recording of historic highs in dividends of listed companies. All indications show that 2025 will prove to be a landmark year for cash distributions by companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. So far  regular dividend distributions are just below 5 billion euros  and if we add bank interim dividends and OPAP’s  we will surpass the historic high of 5.4 billion euros in 2007.Greek bondsThe momentum created by regaining investment grade  especially in the bond market. Greek bonds show particular resilience when a global “sell-off” occurs in bond markets. Piraeus Bank sees positive prospects for 2026 in the Sovereign Bond Credit Rating  estimating that “if the positive trajectory of the Greek economy continues  then our forecast is for an additional upgrade to Baa2 during 2026.”Since the second half of 2019  Greece’s credit rating has been upgraded by four notches by Fitch  DBRS and Scope (from BB- to BBB) and by five notches by S&P (from B+ to BBB)  as Greece’s large public debt followed a rapid downward path and the economy showed resilience to consecutive external crises  achieving growth rates double those of the Eurozone. Moody’s also upgraded Greece by four notches during the same period  granting investment grade this March  though with a rating one step lower than the other houses.The banksThe major Greek banks (Alpha Bank  Eurobank  National Bank and Piraeus Bank) announced total net profits of 3.509 billion euros for the nine months of 2025  an encouraging sign of stable profitability. All indications suggest that in 2025 the four systemic pillars of the market will comfortably exceed 4 billion euros. With this performance they will be able to continue distributing strong dividends and also build the capital necessary for granting new loans.Greek banks benefit significantly from the Greek recovery story and the increase in corporate lending  according to estimates from international houses.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,positive,0.59,0.41,0.0,True,English,"['Greek rendezvous', '30 trillion dollars', 'Morgan Stanley', 'The', 'London', 'Mitsotakis', 'Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis', 'international house FTSE Russell', '4th Greek Investment Conference', 'The Athens Stock Exchange', 'major international investment houses', 'global Developed Market indices', 'Sovereign Bond Credit Rating', 'international economic environment', '100 powerful global funds', 'global economic stage', 'consecutive external crises', 'total net profits', 'International house Wood', 'regional energy hub', 'Vertical Energy Corridor', 'Advanced Emerging Markets', 'regular dividend distributions', 'Greek recovery story', 'four systemic pillars', 'total market capitalization', 'substantial capital inflows', 'European energy map', 'Greek energy sector', 'rapid downward path', 'Greek financial markets', 'major Greek banks', 'large public debt', 'Greek stock market', 'strong growth story', 'bank interim dividends', 'Greek capital market', 'Developed Markets', 'international investors', 'bond markets', 'investment grade', 'global “sell-off', 'other houses', 'stock valuations', 'European market', 'Greek debt', 'Greek market', 'recent energy', 'energy bridge', 'cash distributions', 'strong dividends', 'Greek mission', 'Greek bonds', 'four notches', 'Greek economy', '30 trillion dollars', 'Morgan Stanley', 'government assigns', 'dynamic return', 'JP Morgan', 'growth rate', 'sixth year', 'geopolitical upgrade', 'fertile ground', 'new investors', 'foreign investors', 'following facts', 'clear runway', 'fiscal stability', 'fiscal data', 'positive revision', 'same time', 'sharp decline', 'new chapter', 'crucial point', '6 trillion euros', 'apparent recording', 'historic highs', 'landmark year', '5 billion euros', '5.4 billion euros', 'Piraeus Bank', 'additional upgrade', 'second half', 'five notches', 'S&P', 'same period', 'Alpha Bank', 'National Bank', '3.509 billion euros', 'nine months', 'encouraging sign', 'new loans', 'corporate lending', 'growth prospects', 'positive prospects', 'significant meeting', 'EU average', 'particular resilience', 'positive trajectory', 'stable profitability', 'listed companies', 'Newsroom', 'largest', 'place', 'London', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'cooperation', 'indication', 'importance', 'Greece', 'success', 'HSBC', 'America', 'Company', 'Reforms', 'development', 'factors', 'country', 'weapons', 'next', 'years', 'conditions', 'rest', 'overperformance', 'scenario', 'role', 'signing', 'agreement', 'transport', 'LNG', 'USA', 'core', 'September', 'category', 'move', 'pool', 'acquisition', 'level', 'participants', 'network', 'size', 'OPAP', 'momentum', 'forecast', 'Baa2', 'Fitch', 'DBRS', 'Scope', 'BB', 'B+', 'Eurozone', 'Moody', 'Eurobank', 'increase', '1,800', '2025']",2025-11-30,2025-12-01,en.protothema.gr
