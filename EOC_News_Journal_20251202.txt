Our actions must nor create obstacles to a peace plan "" Prevot said in a comment to a European newspaper on Monday.Prevot called the initiative a problem for the ongoing peace talks. A spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed to the paper that the Commission was working on the loan despite Belgium's objections. On November 25  Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said that Belgium did not want to use Russia's frozen assets to fund Ukraine's war effort without securing EU guarantees. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has repeatedly said that Belgium needs ""concrete and reliable"" guarantees to implement the EU Commission's plan. He argued in a letter to the Commission that a hasty decision to seize Russian funds to use them for financing Ukraine could destroy all chances for a peaceful resolution. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around $162 billion in Russian money could be used to issue a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine would only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage"" from Russia. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $349 billion. Around $232 billion are held in European accounts  predominantly in Euroclear  a Belgium-based securities depository.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251126/top-eu-diplomat-calls-belgiums-concerns-over-use-of-frozen-russian-assets-legitimate-1123178080.htmlrussiaukrainebelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleu frozen russian assets  belgium foreign minister maxime prevot  reparation loan to ukraine  eu commission  russian state assets  belgium objections  ukraine peace talks  eu guarantees for ukraine funding  belgian prime minister bart de wever  russian funds for ukraine  reparations loan  eu and g7 sanctions on russia  frozen foreign currency reserves  euroclear belgium  russia-ukraine conflict  european union's role in ukraine  eu foreign policy.",negative,0.0,0.47,0.53,negative,0.0,0.37,0.63,True,English,"['May Hinder Peace Talks', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Ukraine Loan', 'Belgian Minister', 'EU', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'belgium foreign minister maxime prevot', 'May Hinder Peace Talks', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'theo francken economy', 'foreign currency reserves', 'ongoing peace talks', 'Belgium-based securities depository', 'Belgian news agency', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'ukraine peace talks', 'The European Union', 'Belgian Minister', 'belgium european union', 'foreign policy', 'frozen assets', 'peace negotiations', 'Russian funds', 'Russian money', 'peace plan', 'European newspaper', 'European accounts', 'Sputnik International', 'war effort', 'hasty decision', 'peaceful resolution', 'material damage', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'g7 sanctions', 'russia-ukraine conflict', 'European Commission', 'reparation loan', 'reparations loan', 'reliable"" guarantees', 'important role', 'belgium objections', 'euroclear belgium', 'ukraine funding', 'Ukraine Loan', 'EU guarantees', 'EU Commission', 'russia ukraine', 'sputnikglobe', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'peace-talks', 'belgian-minister', 'push', 'cdn', 'actions', 'obstacles', 'comment', 'Monday', 'initiative', 'spokesperson', 'November', 'concrete', 'letter', 'chances', 'Belga', 'compensation', 'start', 'half', 'diplomat-calls', 'belgiums', 'concerns', 'use', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-01,2025-12-02,sputnikglobe.com

Euroclear is a privately owned bank. It is not an EU government entity. It operates under the supervision of the Bank of Belgium. It also has an ownership structure that includes “users” meaning depositors. It is the owners who will be liable for any lawsuits that declare illegal action  and the suit will obviously not be filed in European courts. It will be anywhere Euroclear has a branch — that is all over Asia. Confiscation of the Russian assets from Euroclear (btw mechanism for this is not defined  it is very possible Euroclear could move the assets to its Asia branches) by the EU will obviously trigger lawsuits. But somehow the EU thinks it is they who will be sued and thus if they can get member states to agree to share the liability  they can proceed. It is not the EU that Russia would be forced to sue. It is Euroclear. Which contains other assets belonging to the other users (countries) who maintain deposits there — which would be most countries. For example  perhaps the remaining Chinese US treasury holdings. It is not clear why Euroclear has not explicitly and publicly protected itself by loudly moving the assets to its Asian branches.To: marshmallowEC just can’t resist grabbing that Ukrainian tar baby.Comment #19 Removed by ModeratorTo: Opinionated BlowhardI hope the EU has the military power to back this up when Russia declares this an act of war and starts appropriating EU assets in Russia.No need to hope.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

In a ruling handed down today  neither bid was accepted by the Court  the first bid was rejected due to the lack of employee retention and the second on the grounds that it did not meet the conditions for a satisfactory takeover.The Evry Commercial Court therefore decided to convert the receivership procedure into judicial liquidation and appointed Maître Alain-François Souchon as liquidator with the task of selling the Company's assets  in particular its patent portfolio.Following this decision  Global Bioenergies requested Euronext Growth to delist its shares  which will become worthless for all its shareholders.Contact information of the court-appointed liquidator:Cabinet.souchon@etude-souchon.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.95,0.04,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['GLOBAL BIOENERGIES', 'judicial liquidation', 'delisting', 'shares', 'Maître Alain-François Souchon', 'two final takeover bids', 'The Evry Commercial Court', 'satisfactory takeover', 'employee retention', 'receivership procedure', 'judicial liquidation', 'patent portfolio', 'Global Bioenergies', 'Euronext Growth', 'Contact information', 'first bid', 'court-appointed liquidator', '01 December', '5:30pm', 'hearing', 'November', 'ruling', 'lack', 'grounds', 'conditions', 'task', 'Company', 'assets', 'decision', 'shares', 'shareholders', 'Cabinet', 'etude', 'Attachment']",2025-12-01,2025-12-02,globenewswire.com

We’re heading full speed toward Christmas with weather that only the other day barely reminded us of winter—at least in Athens—with traffic now torturing us horribly in our daily lives  and just wait  it’ll get even worse as we approach the holidays. Political news these days isn’t exactly thrilling  but it’s packed with many  many small  extremely interesting bits worth commenting on—if not outright gossiping about. For example  I just have to comment on the joint appearance of Venizelos with Karamanlis (Rafina) at an event by the newspaper “Demokratia”—not because the former showed up at a paper that has harshly criticised him (that’s not strange at all to me). But you know  that old “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” trend is very in fashion lately in politics. And let me explain: how is it that suddenly Karamanlis  Venizelos and Samaras—who all dislike Mitsotakis for different reasons—have become buddies and now “hang out” so often? Karamanlis and Samaras have been scaring us for years with doom-and-gloom warnings on national issues. I’m not saying they aren’t entitled to have opinions and express them freely—after all  they were prime ministers—but if you took literally everything they’ve said over the years  Greece should have lost 5–6 islands to the Turks by now. For the moment  though  the Americans keep flying in and out for business in Greece  the Greece–Cyprus–Israel electricity cable is moving forward  Chevron’s drilling projects too  and the American LNG with the “Vertical Corridor” was signed in Athens. So I don’t think their predictions about disaster and national losses were all that accurate. Now Venizelos has joined the “doom crew”—and of course his specialty is economic catastrophe—and he says that once Recovery Fund financing ends in 2027  we’ll sink. Now  I don’t know if he would have said the same if Mitsotakis had made him President of the Republic (maybe he would—hence why he didn’t pick him)  but this little “we’re doomed” tambourine routine is certainly not new. The earliest to play that tune was Alekos Papadopoulos  then Tasos Giannitsis kept it going  and now Venizelos has taken the baton. Anyway  passions are human and the exchange of ideas is free—but the Venizelos–Karamanlis romance (title stolen from yesterday’s Kathimerini) I did not expect!Pier campaigning…-On to government matters: Pierrakakis has been in Dublin since yesterday on a scheduled visit to the new Finance Minister and the country’s central banker  but of course he also met Donohoe  the former Eurogroup president and a strong supporter of him in the race for the position. The minister is campaigning hard and hopes to cross the finish line first. What helps is that the Belgians are tangled up in their refusal to unfreeze the Russian funds (around €140 billion) held in their country for Ukraine’s reconstruction. The Baltic states are furious with them. We’ll see…Eyes on London-While the closure of Venezuelan airspace to American aircraft creates new headaches for markets that had grown accustomed to low oil prices  the Greek investment community has its eyes set on the 4th Morgan Stanley and Athens Stock Exchange Greek Investment Conference  which begins today in London. The programme includes a “closed” Round Table with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis with a small group of invited guests  followed by an “open” discussion between the PM and Clare Woodman  CEO of Morgan Stanley International. There will be a panel with N. Stathopoulos (BC Partners)  M. Rigas (Energean)  and E. Mytilineos (Metlen Energy and Metals)  and another with the CEOs of the four systemic banks. In the Energy section  A. Siamisis (HELLENiQ ENERGY)  M. Manousakis (ADMIE)  and P. Tzanetakis (Motor Oil) will speak. Giorgos Stassis of PPC will have a discussion with Yawen Chen (Thomson Reuters). For tomorrow  an “Investor Breakfast” is scheduled with Minister of National Economy Kyriakos Pierrakakis and a few guests  followed by a fireside chat with the two protagonists of the moment: Pierrakakis and Stéphane Boujnah of Euronext. Throughout the two-day event  one-to-one and group meetings will be held between senior executives of Greek companies and international institutional investors. The conference is taking place at Morgan Stanley’s conference centre and will gather 42 listed companies of the Athens Stock Exchange. This particular roadshow is especially important because the Athens Exchange is on the verge of an upgrade  which means a partial shift in the funds currently tracking the market. So whatever is said today will colour expectations for the ASE’s trajectory and upcoming portfolio moves. Fidelity  Morgan Stanley  Fierra Capital  Amundi  Wellington are among the investment firms that will be grilling the Greek listed companies.The Mitsotakis–Meimarakis meeting-I hear that a very interesting meeting took place a few days ago at the Maximos Mansion. K.M. met with MEP and former party president Vangelis Meimarakis  who is now serving his second term in Brussels. He is considered the soul of the party and has run plenty of party congresses  but this time the role they discussed—and which he will take on—is different and much more European. Ahead of Greece’s EU Presidency in the second half of 2027  K.M. and Meimarakis agreed that the latter will assume a special parliamentary role  something foreseen in the framework of a national Presidency. In practice  this means he will act as coordinator for the arrivals of ministers and deputy ministers from foreign countries to Greece from July until the end of the Presidency and will generally oversee the entire parliamentary aspect of the Presidency. Clearly  K.M. wants to “warm up” as many people as he can right now.Payments from OPEKEPE-The government is on alert with the farmers and knows that the advance payment of the Basic Aid won’t be enough to ease tensions. So all payments announced by the government must be completed within December (€1.2 billion more  in addition to the €500 million recently paid). Chatzidakis is anxious and constantly presses OPEKEPE and the Ministry of Rural Development’s mechanisms to complete all payments before the holidays. Of course  the government will also have to wage a big communication battle to counter  as government officials say  the opposition’s nihilism and that of certain farm-union leaders…Tsipras—book-On Wednesday at the “Pallas” theatre  Tsipras is set to present his book  and naturally the real interest is not how many but who will be sitting in the audience at this open-entry event. The publicity around “Ithaca” has been huge indeed; how this will all develop I think will depend on what Tsipras does over the coming months. I did  however  ask—because I was very curious—what advice he had received from the French specialists of Publicis Groupe  who are handling his rebranding  about whether he should publish the book or not. Their answer was positive  though I’m told he would have published it anyway.The hour of truth at the Athens Bar Association-After 23:00 tonight—once the second day of voting at the ABA is completed—we will know the duo heading to the second round. Based on rolling polls  the frontrunners are Dimitris Anastasopoulos  associated with ND and running a very active campaign  and PASOK-leaning Andreas Koutsolampros  who used to be elected as top-voted council member under Verve­sos. It’s said that Verve­sos supports him behind the scenes  while Michael Kalantzopoulos (from Androulakis’s circle) and left-wing Thanasis Kampagiannis  who has strong appeal among younger lawyers  also hope to make the runoff. Among the little moments passed on to me from yesterday’s voting was the appearance of Alpha TV host Stamatina Tsimtsili outside the Association  since her husband Themis Sofos  running with the “Ergatiki” faction  is also contesting the presidency—though with slim chances of making the second round.OLYMPOS and CVC negotiating for DELTA-And let’s move to market news  which is showing significant activity. My column’s antennae have “caught” two deals now in preparation. For one of them I’ll need a few more days  so let’s move to the food sector  where—according to information—talks are under way between the Sarantis brothers of OLYMPOS and CVC for DELTA (only DELTA  not Vivartia). CVC is known to want to divest  while the Hellenic Dairies Group of the Sarantis brothers is the undisputed leader of the sector with sales expected to exceed €900 million this year  whereas DELTA’s sales last year were €291 million. I also remind you that brothers Takis and Michalis Sarantis—as well as the new generation now involved in management—bought one of DELTA’s “silverware”  United Milk in Bulgaria  in 2022  strengthening their presence in the local market  while the group’s expansion mood is further confirmed by the recent acquisition of DODONI. I asked my source whether  if the deal goes through  it will pass Competition Commission review  and I got the response: “Why not? There’s MEVGAL  Kolios and many others.”The Russians and the animal feed–Since we brought up DELTA  if you remember  the Russians — the former main shareholders of DODONI — had held on to a 25% stake in the company. Eventually  in 2023  that 25% was sold by SI Foods (Lime Capital Partners) to CVC  which secured 100% control of DODONI  transferred it to VIVARTIA  and ultimately it ended up in the group Hellenic Dairy Shops of the Sarantis brothers. I’m told  therefore  that the Russians  former main shareholders of DODONI  have purchased an animal-feed company that DELTA owned. What business logic this investment has  I honestly can’t figure out  but I assume they have some business plan we’re not aware of.Sudden postponement of the inauguration of the Crete–Attica cable although everything was ready–The news dropped like a thunderbolt. No official explanation has been given  but information converges that the decision to postpone the inauguration of the Crete–Attica electrical interconnection — scheduled for December 10 in the presence of the Prime Minister — “locked in” at the Maximos Mansion. What exactly intervened  no one can say with certainty  since lately every issue concerning the operator is burning hot: from the Cyprus cable to the future of the oil-fired units that will remain operational in Crete even after the big interconnection starts operating  to the €1 billion capital increase sought by ADMIE. It did not go unnoticed that at Friday’s Greek–Arab forum  CEO Manos Manousakis made sure to publicly stress the need for support and financial reinforcement  confirming the strong investment interest from the United Arab Emirates. As he also noted  there are ongoing discussions with TAQA (the state energy company of Abu Dhabi) about a potential equity participation in the Greece–Cyprus–Israel interconnection  and he referred as well to the progress of the Saudi Greek Interconnection  established in February 2024 as a special-purpose subsidiary of ADMIE and the National Grid (the Transmission System Operator of Saudi Arabia)  in which each side holds 50%. As stated  once the study for the Greece–Saudi Arabia electrical interconnection is completed  it will move to the stage of a final investment decision  and it will obviously attract international capital to materialize  since it is a high-cost project. Particularly noteworthy  however  were the messages the ADMIE CEO sent during his remarks. Manousakis spoke of the rapid rise of RES and the need to expand interconnections  clearly implying that the current funding model is insufficient. The state shareholders of the operators cannot shoulder alone the weight of the projects ahead  and the solution points toward public–private partnerships. The electricity-transmission sector — previously considered closed  with limited access for private investors — is opening up. ADMIE is asking for “flexibility ” “incentives ” “adjusted rules.” In other words  regulatory facilitation so that funds and foreign investors can get into the game. And not just as lenders  but as shareholders as well. Manousakis and the head of ADMIE Holdings  Giannis Karampelas  will have the opportunity to communicate all these ideas to the international investment community this week in London  where they will attend the Morgan Stanley conference mentioned earlier. All eyes will be on them — not only because of the cables  but mainly because of the strategy for the day after.Four senior executives of Piraeus Bank join the new Board of Directors of National Insurance–The “promise” that combining forces can create large-scale results — and certainly value far above the €600 million Piraeus Bank paid to acquire National Insurance — was given by the bank’s CEO  Christos Megalou  on Friday night in a meeting with the company’s staff. He said that after seeing what the insurer’s network achieves  studying the performance of Bancassurance under the previous regime (i.e.  in collaboration with NBG) and also the Bancassurance dynamics Piraeus had with its previous providers  he arrived at the strategic idea of joining forces for greater momentum and higher profits. Piraeus Bank has set the goal of National Insurance profits exceeding €100 million in 2028. Procedurally  four members of the bank’s senior management are entering the National Insurance board. They are the bank’s CFO  Theodoros Gnardelis; the Senior General Manager heading retail banking  Vasileios Koutentakis; the Senior General Manager heading human resources of the Piraeus Group  Giorgos Georgopoulos; and the Senior General Manager responsible for the group’s operational units  Charalambos Margaritis.Avramar: The Canadians and the proposal to the Arabs–In the coming days the banks must resolve the Gordian knot of Avramar  which is now burdened with short-term debt obligations of €340 million  out of a total €580.23 million  at the end of 2024. The wedge driven by the Canadian Cooke — a global player in aquaculture — has shaken up the landscape  as it comes with very attractive features. What matters most to the creditor banks is that the Canadians are putting up cash immediately  buying loans and avoiding the long and deeply bureaucratic pre-bankruptcy restructuring procedures required to rehabilitate the company. Total recovery for the banks may exceed €130–140 million  and another advantage is that Cooke is an investor who knows the sector extremely well. On the other hand  the banks have already signed a framework agreement with Aqua Bridge for Avramar  following a competitive process that designated the Arabs as preferred investors  with a proposal that includes a loan haircut of around 70% and a seven-year repayment of the remaining obligations. Given the MoU  such agreements — as sources close to the process say — do not break easily  and a unilateral change would bring complications. Consequently  reports indicate that Aqua Bridge will be offered — or  if you prefer  given the chance — to adjust its proposal so that it acquires the characteristics of the Canadian offer and maximizes capital recovery for the banks. It remains to be seen how they will respond and how the Gordian knot will be cut.Banks rev up their engines – Target: €13 billion in credit expansion–Don’t let it fool you  bankers say — the 5.4% drop in total financing of the domestic economy in October. Indeed  that’s what the Bank of Greece statistics recorded  but that figure does not reflect the overall performance of lending the banks will show in 2025. The decrease is partly artificial  because in October 2024 the banks had disbursed the large €2.55 billion syndicated loan for Attiki Odos  and comparing with last year the October 2025 figure appears weaker. However  banks are revving up their engines especially in corporate lending  and the target is for credit expansion to exceed €13 billion — something achievable if one considers the completion of the Egnatia Odos concession and the financial closing of the transaction at the end of the year  totaling €1.35 billion.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.1,0.11,0.8,True,English,"['little “doom crew', 'Greek business scene', 'new entry', 'Benny', 'Rafina', 'London', 'French', 'Tsipras', 'book', 'CVC', 'Olympos', 'Delta', 'Greece–Cyprus–Israel electricity cable', 'many small, extremely interesting bits', 'Athens Stock Exchange Greek Investment Conference', 'The Mitsotakis–Meimarakis meeting', 'Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis', 'Greek investment community', 'The Baltic states', 'Recovery Fund financing', 'closed” Round Table', 'four systemic banks', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'international institutional investors', 'upcoming portfolio moves', 'happy new month', 'low oil prices', 'former Eurogroup president', 'Greek listed companies', 'former party president', '4th Morgan Stanley', 'Morgan Stanley International', 'new Finance Minister', 'interesting meeting', 'Venizelos–Karamanlis romance', 'Greek companies', 'investment firms', 'Athens Exchange', 'small group', 'prime ministers', 'conference centre', 'Vangelis Meimarakis', '42 listed companies', 'new headaches', 'Motor Oil', 'Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'good morning', 'full speed', 'daily lives', 'Political news', 'joint appearance', 'different reasons', 'gloom warnings', 'national issues', 'drilling projects', 'American LNG', 'Vertical Corridor', 'national losses', 'economic catastrophe', 'tambourine routine', 'Alekos Papadopoulos', 'Tasos Giannitsis', 'Pier campaigning', 'government matters', 'central banker', 'strong supporter', 'finish line', 'Venezuelan airspace', 'American aircraft', 'Clare Woodman', 'N.
