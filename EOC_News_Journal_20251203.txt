53971,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/628752-ecb-frozen-assets/,ECB balks at €140bn Ukraine payout backed by Russian assets – FT,Read Full Article at RT.com,The ECB has refused to backstop a €140 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian funds  the FT has reportedThe European Central Bank has refused to support European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's plan to make a €140 billion payout to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets  the Financial Times reported on Tuesday  citing officials familiar with the discussions.The ECB determined that the European Commission’s scheme  which leverages sovereign Russian assets held in the privately owned Belgian company Euroclear  falls outside its mandate  the newspaper reported.The EU has spent months trying to tap frozen Russian central bank reserves to back a €140 billion ($160 billion) “reparations loan” for Kiev. Belgium has repeatedly warned of potential litigation as well as financial risks if the EU goes through with the scheme.Under the European Commission’s plan  EU nations’ governments would provide state guarantees to share the repayment risk on the loan for Ukraine.Commission officials  however  have warned that member states might be unable to mobilize cash quickly in an emergency  risking market strains.EU officials reportedly asked the ECB whether it could act as a lender of last resort to Euroclear Bank  the Belgian depository’s lending arm  to prevent a liquidity crunch. ECB officials told the commission this was not possible  the FT reported  citing sources familiar with the talks.“Such a proposal is not under consideration as it would likely violate EU treaty law prohibiting monetary financing ” the ECB said.Brussels is now reportedly working on alternative ways to provide temporary liquidity to backstop the €140 billion loan.“Ensuring the necessary liquidity for possible obligations to return the assets to the Russian central bank is an important part of a possible reparations loan ” the FT quoted an EC spokesperson as saying.Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain warned last week the move would be seen globally as “confiscation of central bank reserves  undermining the rule of law.” Moscow has repeatedly warned it would view any use of its sovereign assets as “theft” and respond with countermeasures.The push comes as the cash-strapped EU faces pressure to finance Ukraine for the next two years amid Kiev’s cash crunch  with efforts to tap Russia’s assets intensifying as the US promotes a new initiative to settle the conflict. Economists estimate Ukraine is facing a budget gap of about $53 billion a year in 2025-2028  excluding additional military funding.The country’s public and government-guaranteed debt ballooned to unseen levels of over $191 billion as of September  the Finance Ministry said.

53972,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now,Europe should seize Russia’s frozen assets now,With US aid stalled  only Moscow’s immobilised billions can keep Ukraine fighting.,The Trump administration is now determining what the future holds for Ukraine  and by extension for Europe  in matters of territorial integrity  sovereignty and security. Washington aims to make a deal to end the full-scale war Russia launched in February 2022 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has waged against Ukraine  even if it means abandoning longstanding international principles that prohibit the recognition of territory acquired through military occupation.For Europe more broadly  and the European Union in particular  however  there is far more at stake than those principles  which Washington has rarely prioritised in its own foreign policy.Deterring Putin from further aggression  and ensuring that Ukraine is stable both politically and economically  lies at the core of the bloc’s security and political concerns. A settlement to the conflict that fails to achieve either would risk the bloc’s own long-term security.Of course  all of this must be managed while ensuring that the Trump administration does not itself further endanger European security by once again casting doubt on its commitment to NATO’s security infrastructure. But Europe has already  if belatedly  begun to wake up to these concerns. By last year  23 NATO members were spending the target 2 percent of GDP on defence  and the alliance agreed a new goal of raising core defence spending to at least 3.5 percent of GDP by 2035  with up to another 1.5 percent of GDP to be spent on critical infrastructure and on expanding their defence industrial bases.AdvertisementMore immediately  Europe has also surpassed the US for the first time since June 2022 in total military aid for Ukraine  with 72 billion euros ($83.6bn) allocated compared with Washington’s 65 billion euros ($75.5bn) by the end of April  according to the Ukraine Support Tracker.Yet  regardless of the outcome of the Trump administration’s efforts to push Ukraine towards a negotiating position that Putin might be willing to accept  the increased European support is not enough to offset the standstill in US funding. Military aid is also only one part of the picture: Kyiv is dependent on the West’s fiscal aid as well  to ensure the continued functioning of its government. And the bill for reconstruction only continues to grow as Russia’s assaults and aerial attacks continue. In February  the World Bank estimated it at $524bn (506 billion euros) —about 280 percent of Kyiv’s 2024 GDP.Without dramatic action  Europe risks being left to Trump’s whims as to its future security  despite having bowed to his demands not only on NATO spending and military support for Ukraine  but also on trade through agreements that have seen the US’s average tariff rate on imports from the EU and UK rise sharply.But there is a clear policy choice that Europe can make to ensure that financial support for Kyiv remains sufficient over the coming years and to shape the outcome of any settlement to the conflict  while simultaneously further deterring Putin.The European Union and the United Kingdom can move to confiscate the sovereign Russian funds frozen in their jurisdictions since 2022. Most importantly  they can seize the 185 billion euros ($214.8bn) frozen at the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear – the majority of which is now in cash and can thus rapidly be deployed or reinvested – as well as the Russian government funds frozen at Euroclear’s Luxembourg-based rival  Clearstream  which are estimated to amount to around 20 billion euros ($23.2bn).Europe is not unaware of this possibility  and in fact  it has been debating doing so for months. The Euroclear assets have already been used to underpin an earlier $50bn (43 billion euros) loan to Ukraine finalised in January 2025  which is secured over earnings from those assets.Europe had been expected to advance a plan to create a new loan – one amounting to as much as 140 billion euros ($162.6bn) – secured over the assets at the European Council meeting on December 18-19  after delaying a final decision at the previous council meeting on October 23. The delay was largely due to obstinacy from the Belgian government  which has demanded indemnification from the rest of Europe while endorsing Kremlin talking points that such a move would be unprecedented.AdvertisementYet there is ample precedent. German and Japanese government assets were seized by the United States in the course of the second world war. In the latter case  Japan’s assets were even frozen before the attack on Pearl Harbour  the majority of which were later retained under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951.The Kremlin’s threats to tie up Belgium in decades-long litigation are also overblown. They rely on a pre-Soviet-collapse bilateral investment treaty that Putin and his proxies have already failed to invoke successfully to unfreeze their assets or challenge previous sanctions. Additionally  there are dozens of unresolved claims worth tens of billions of dollars against Russia in European courts — including the roughly 13-billion-euro ($15bn) arbitration award won by energy firm Uniper against Gazprom for disruption to gas supplies in 2022. The largest and most significant case remains the 2014 award to former shareholders of Yukos  over the Kremlin’s expropriation of their company. That award survived all appeals: in October 2025  the Supreme Court of the Netherlands rejected Russia’s final challenge  confirming that the award — now valued at more than $65bn  including interest — is final and enforceable against Russian state assets worldwide. Enforcement  however  will still depend on locating suitable Russian assets that courts are willing and able to seize.The Kremlin will certainly engage in lawfare and litigation over these disputes  as it has repeatedly throughout Putin’s tenure. But it will lose  and when its national interests are at stake  it will pay. Russia has repeatedly complied with adverse rulings when vital access to Western markets or assets was at stake. The only clear-cut cases of either the West or Russia returning funds owed as a result of litigation arising from Russia’s war have been the settlements paid by Russian state insurer NSK and aviation firm Aeroflot over Putin’s 2022 seizure of aircraft leased from Western companies.There is no excuse for Europe’s delays in acting thus far. Every month of inaction increases both the financial burden on Europe and the likelihood that Washington will strike a deal that sidelines European interests. The question is now a critical one: how to ensure Ukraine’s continued financing and its ability to sustain its defence. It is also all the more important that Europe act before the Trump Administration tries to secure a deal with the Kremlin over its head.The 28-point “peace plan” formulated by Kremlin insiders and signed off by Trump’s special envoy and long-time associate Steve Witkoff last month not only includes carving up these same frozen funds and even demands that Europe itself provide a further $100 billion  but would also divert frozen Russian assets away from Ukraine’s reconstruction while imposing an additional financial burden directly on Europe. Such a deal would leave Europe footing an even larger bill if the Kremlin fails to adhere to its commitments — as it did with the ceasefire agreements struck in 2014 and 2015 following its initial invasion of Ukraine.AdvertisementEurope has the leverage to advance its political  economic and military security in the negotiations over Ukraine’s future  and it must not be afraid to use it.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.,negative,0.02,0.29,0.7,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'earlier $50bn (43 billion euros) loan', 'San Francisco Peace Treaty', 'Soviet-collapse bilateral investment treaty', '13-billion-euro ($15bn) arbitration award', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'sovereign Russian funds', 'average tariff rate', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'Russian government funds', 'clear policy choice', 'previous council meeting', 'Kremlin talking points', 'second world war', 'defence industrial bases', 'European Council meeting', 'longstanding international principles', 'full-scale war Russia', 'total military aid', 'The European Union', 'The Trump administration', 'Japanese government assets', 'core defence spending', 'Ukraine Support Tracker', 'The Euroclear assets', 'new loan', 'The Kremlin', '72 billion euros', '65 billion euros', '6 billion euros', '185 billion euros', '140 billion euros', 'European support', 'foreign policy', 'World Bank', 'military support', 'previous sanctions', 'fiscal aid', 'European courts', 'military occupation', 'financial support', 'Belgian government', 'NATO spending', 'territorial integrity', 'European security', 'last year', 'new goal', 'critical infrastructure', 'first time', 'negotiating position', 'one part', 'continued functioning', 'aerial attacks', 'dramatic action', 'coming years', 'United Kingdom', 'Luxembourg-based rival', 'final decision', 'ample precedent', 'United States', 'latter case', 'Pearl Harbour', 'decades-long litigation', 'unresolved claims', 'energy firm', 'long-term security', 'security infrastructure', '23 NATO members', 'political concerns', 'US funding', 'target 2 percent', 'future security', '20 billion', '3.5 percent', '1.5 percent', '280 percent', 'extension', 'matters', 'sovereignty', 'Washington', 'deal', 'February', 'recognition', 'territory', 'stake', 'aggression', 'bloc', 'settlement', 'conflict', 'doubt', 'commitment', 'GDP', 'alliance', 'Advertisement', 'June', 'April', 'outcome', 'efforts', 'standstill', 'picture', 'Kyiv', 'West', 'reconstruction', 'assaults', 'whims', 'demands', 'trade', 'agreements', 'imports', 'jurisdictions', 'majority', 'cash', 'Clearstream', 'possibility', 'fact', 'months', 'January', 'earnings', 'plan', 'December', 'October', 'delay', 'obstinacy', 'indemnification', 'rest', 'move', 'German', 'course', 'threats', 'proxies', 'dozens', 'billions', 'dollars']",2025-12-02,2025-12-03,aljazeera.com

The ECB’s internal analysis found the commission’s proposal amounted to direct financing of governments  since the central bank would assume the financial obligations of member states jointly guaranteeing the loan repayment under Brussels’ plan  the report said. Providing such funds by central banks is prohibited under the Treaty on European Union  it added. Following the ECB’s refusal  the commission started developing alternative measures to temporarily secure liquidity for an over $162 billion loan  the newspaper reported. The European Commission has been seeking to get the EU countries to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that the amount involved stands at around $162 billion in the form of a ""reparation loan "" which Ukraine will conditionally have to repay after the end of the conflict and in case of ""compensation for material damage from Moscow."" Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the EU and the G7 froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $348 billion. Around $232 billion are held in European accounts  predominantly at Belgium's Euroclear. On November 27  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the confiscation of immobilized Russian assets would be considered as theft of property and undermine confidence in the eurozone.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251201/eus-ukraine-loan-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets-may-hinder-peace-talks---belgian-minister-1123205844.htmlukrainerussiabelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalecb  european central bank  european commission  frozen russian assets  ukraine loan  kiev financing  euroclear  eu sanctions  eu budget  russia assets freeze  eurozone liquidity  reparation loan  eu–russia relations  financial stability  brussels policy  eu economics  eurozone crisis risk  international finance  ukraine conflict  sanctions policy",negative,0.0,0.33,0.67,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['European Commission Plan', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Ukraine Loan', 'ECB', 'Report', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'The European Central Bank', 'europe ukraine russia belgium', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Belgian news agency', 'The European Commission', 'eurozone crisis risk', 'European Commission Plan', 'Financial Times newspaper', 'central banks', 'Brussels’ plan', 'european union', 'European accounts', 'russia assets', 'financial obligations', 'financial stability', 'The ECB', 'multiple officials', 'EC officials', 'last resort', 'clearing system', 'liquidity crisis', 'internal analysis', 'direct financing', 'member states', 'alternative measures', 'material damage', 'military operation', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'kiev financing', 'russia relations', 'brussels policy', 'international finance', 'sanctions policy', 'Sputnik International', 'loan repayment', '$162 billion loan', 'reparation loan', 'EU countries', 'eu sanctions', 'eu economics', 'eurozone liquidity', 'Ukraine Loan', 'Euroclear settlement', 'ukraine conflict', 'sputnikglobe', 'report', 'MOSCOW', 'request', 'Tuesday', 'economy', 'cdn', '38ad8f0efdfa395682e6acfc97c33f56', 'lender', 'proposal', 'governments', 'funds', 'Treaty', 'refusal', 'November', 'Belga', 'amount', 'form', 'case', 'compensation', 'start', 'G7', 'half', 'confiscation', 'theft', 'property', 'confidence', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'peace-talks', 'belgian-minister', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'budget']",2025-12-02,2025-12-03,sputnikglobe.com

In the second  the European Commission would raise the necessary funds on the financial markets. But it's the third option -- a reparations loan leveraging frozen Russian sovereign wealth assets in the EU -- that is the most popular  as it wouldn't directly hit the pockets of EU taxpayers.It's not that straightforward  however.Firstly  time is running out to decide  and Belgium  where most of these assets are frozen  still opposes the move. Then there's the United States  which in its original proposal also expressed interest in obtaining a large part of the funds.Von der Leyen told the European Parliament on November 26 that she couldn't ""see any scenario in which the European taxpayers alone will pay the bill"" for Ukraine and that she was ready to present the legal text for the reparations loan.Securing Backing For A Reparations LoanAccording to RFE/RL sources  the European Commission is currently working on as many as 11 legal acts when it comes to the loan  and there is plenty of frustration in EU capitals that have yet to see concrete details of how the plan would work.A European Commission official told RFE/RL that the original idea was to first secure political backing for the reparations loan when EU leaders gather at an EU summit in Brussels on December 18. The finer points would be ironed out early next year to allow the money to start flowing to Kyiv by the second quarter of 2026.There's also a fear that national diplomats and lawyers would get bogged down in details and derail any chances of a deal if the legal acts are presented too soon.Belgium  which hosts the financial markets company Euroclear where most Russian bonds are frozen  wants to see proper guarantees from other EU member states as it expects a legal retaliation from Moscow. To shoulder claims of 140 billion euros from Russia -- an amount that is one-third of Belgium's annual GDP -- would be a disaster for the country.In a letter seen by RFE/RL addressed to von der Leyen on the topic by Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever  he once again spelled out his concerns.""While l have full sympathy for the argument that the European taxpayer should not be the only one picking up the tab for the financial support of Ukraine  the brutal legal reality isthat at no moment in history have immobilized sovereign assets been 're-purposed' during an ongoing war "" he wrote.""Such assets have been the object of decisions during post-war settlements  usually in the context of war reparations by the losing party.""The European Commission  however  still believes an agreement can be made in December if enough EU member states make legally binding guarantees to back the reparations loan based on their gross national income (GNI). This means smaller -- and more skeptical -- countries such as Hungary and Slovakia can opt out as their total share of EU GNI is miniscule.But the other wealthier and larger European countries need to be onboard to share the costs. And Brussels hopes other non-EU G7 countries could chip in  as well.""If the European Council were to be called upon to decide on a reparations loan scheme at its upcoming meeting  it will only be possible on the basis that all the concerns expressed above are adequately and fully covered "" De Wever wrote at the end of his letter to Von der Leyen.""This includes a full guarantee to be provided by willing member states enabling Euroclear to maintain liquidity of the assets for their total amount.""'The American Angle'But the Belgians aren't the only obstacle to be overcome.There's also the ""American angle "" as some EU officials put it.The original 28-point US peace plan noted ""$100 billion in frozen Russian assets will be invested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine"" and that ""the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from this venture.""This wording truly rattled European politicians and diplomats alike  especially as they had envisioned that the money given to Ukraine in the shape of a reparations loan to a large extent would be used by Kyiv to buy European-produced weapons.EU officials say most parts of the original US proposal have been watered down or taken out completely  but they admit that any final document could change considerably and they aren't privy to the latest discussions on the wording.While the EU would want the reparation loan to be a European project  most diplomats concede it is essential to keep Washington onboard -- and happy. That could mean being open to the idea of the United States getting some of the funds or at least Ukraine using the cash to buy American arms.Crucially  though  Brussels also has to ensure that the United States continues to pressure Hungary into agreeing to the rollover of EU sanctions  which include the frozen Russian assets  every six months.In July  when it was time to renew the measures  Hungary didn't threaten a veto  and this was largely due to American pressure. Brussels hopes the United States will play that same role when the sanctions need to be extended again in January.Source: https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-frozen-assets-europe- us-peace-talks-ukraine/33609999.htmlCopyright (c) 2025.

53977,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/12/02/ecb-refuses-to-provide-backstop-for-140bn-ukraine-loan/,ECB refuses to provide backstop for €140bn Ukraine loan,Central bank rejects role in European Commission proposal that would use frozen Russian assets,The European Central Bank has refused to backstop a €140 billion payment to Ukraine  dealing a blow to an European Union (EU) plan to raise a “reparations loan” backed by frozen Russian assets. Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/GettyThe European Central Bank has refused to backstop a €140 billion payment to Ukraine  dealing a blow to an European Union (EU) plan to raise a “reparations loan” backed by frozen Russian assets.The ECB concluded that the European Commission proposal violated its mandate  according to multiple officials  adding to Brussels’ difficulties in raising the giant loan against Russian central bank assets immobilised at Euroclear  the Belgian securities depository.It comes amid pressure on the EU to finance Ukraine for the next two years  as Kyiv faces a cash crunch amid a renewed Russian military onslaught and a US peace initiative.Under the European Commission plan  EU countries would provide state guarantees to ensure the repayment risk on the €140 billion loan to Ukraine is shared.But commission officials said the countries would not be able to raise the cash rapidly in an emergency  and this could put markets under pressure.The officials asked the ECB whether it could act as a lender of last resort to Euroclear Bank  the lending arm of the Belgian institution  to avoid a liquidity crisis  according to four people briefed on the discussions.ECB officials told the commission this was impossible  three of these people said.The ECB’s internal analysis concluded that the commission proposal was equivalent to providing direct funding to governments  as the central bank would cover the financial obligations of member states.[ ECB vice-president says true single market for goods key to simplifying business rulesOpens in new window ]This practice  called “monetary financing” by economists  is banned in EU treaties because of evidence it results in high inflation and loss of central bank credibility.The ECB said “such a proposal is not under consideration as it would likely violate EU treaty law prohibiting monetary financing”.In response to the ECB’s stance  the commission has begun working on alternative proposals that would provide temporary liquidity to backstop the €140 billion loan  according to two officials briefed on the matter.A commission spokesperson said it had been “in close contact with the ECB” since late October  and the central bank had “participated actively in all the discussions” regarding the loan proposal.If Irish households are so rich  why does it feel like an illusion? Listen | 37:31“Ensuring the necessary liquidity for possible obligations to return the assets to the Russian central bank is an important part of a possible reparations loan ” they added.“This is a must to ensure that the EU  its member states and private bodies can always fulfil its international obligations. Reflections on how to ensure this liquidity in detail are ongoing.”Euroclear declined to comment.The EU has frozen Russian assets worth about €210 billion since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Belgium has opposed the loan to Kyiv on the grounds that in the event the Russian assets were unfrozen and Moscow was able to reclaim them  Euroclear would not be able to repay the money immediately.Belgium’s prime minister Bart De Wever has said the EU plan is “fundamentally wrong”  and demanded the bloc’s other 26 member states sign up to “legally binding  unconditional  irrevocable  on-demand  joint and several guarantees” to share the risk of repaying the loan.He wants such a commitment before EU leaders gather on December 18 for a summit that is meant to decide how the bloc should continue funding Kyiv.Mr De Wever argues the member state guarantees and some form of backstop are required in case the EU sanctions that keep the Russian assets immobilised are suddenly annulled.The sanctions have to be rolled over every six months through a unanimous decision. Some countries  including Hungary  have argued against renewal.The US push for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine  and alternative proposals from the Trump administration for use of Moscow’s immobilised assets  have raised concerns across the EU.Belgium is particularly worried a potential peace agreement struck between Washington and Moscow could negate the EU sanctions and force Euroclear to repay Russia immediately.Under the commission’s proposal  Ukraine would only have to repay the money if Russia agreed to pay reparations to Kyiv. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,negative,0.01,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['€140bn Ukraine loan', 'ECB', 'backstop', 'The Financial Times Limited', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank assets', 'central bank credibility', 'true single market', 'Bart De Wever', 'binding, unconditional, irrevocable', 'Mr De Wever', 'potential peace agreement', 'Belgian securities depository', 'next two years', 'Russian military onslaught', 'US peace initiative', 'EU treaty law', 'other 26 member states', 'member state guarantees', 'European Commission plan', 'European Commission proposal', 'possible reparations loan', 'European Union', 'financial obligations', 'peace deal', 'Russian assets', 'Belgian institution', 'possible obligations', 'US push', 'The ECB', 'several guarantees', 'two officials', 'Euroclear Bank', 'immobilised assets', 'EU) plan', 'EU plan', '€140 billion payment', 'Kirill Kudryavtsev', 'Brussels’ difficulties', 'last resort', 'lending arm', 'internal analysis', 'business rulesOpens', 'new window', 'high inflation', 'monetary financing', 'alternative proposals', 'close contact', 'late October', 'Irish households', 'important part', 'private bodies', 'international obligations', 'full-scale invasion', 'prime minister', 'unanimous decision', 'Trump administration', 'giant loan', '€140 billion loan', 'commission spokesperson', 'EU treaties', 'EU leaders', 'multiple officials', 'liquidity crisis', 'temporary liquidity', 'necessary liquidity', 'loan proposal', 'commission officials', 'ECB vice-president', 'EU sanctions', 'cash crunch', 'repayment risk', 'four people', 'direct funding', 'ECB officials', 'EU countries', 'Ukraine', 'blow', 'Photograph', 'Getty', 'mandate', 'pressure', 'Kyiv', 'emergency', 'markets', 'lender', 'discussions', 'governments', 'goods', 'practice', 'economists', 'evidence', 'loss', 'consideration', 'response', 'stance', 'matter', 'illusion', 'Listen', 'must', 'Reflections', 'detail', 'Belgium', 'grounds', 'event', 'Moscow', 'money', 'bloc', 'demand', 'joint', 'commitment', 'December', 'summit', 'form', 'backstop', 'case', 'Hungary', 'renewal', 'concerns', 'Washington', 'Copyright']",2025-12-02,2025-12-03,irishtimes.com
53978,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now,Europe should seize Russia’s frozen assets now,With US aid stalled  only Moscow’s immobilised billions can keep Ukraine fighting.,The Trump administration is now determining what the future holds for Ukraine  and by extension for Europe  in matters of territorial integrity  sovereignty and security. Washington aims to make a deal to end the full-scale war Russia launched in February 2022 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has waged against Ukraine  even if it means abandoning longstanding international principles that prohibit the recognition of territory acquired through military occupation.For Europe more broadly  and the European Union in particular  however  there is far more at stake than those principles  which Washington has rarely prioritised in its own foreign policy.Deterring Putin from further aggression  and ensuring that Ukraine is stable both politically and economically  lies at the core of the bloc’s security and political concerns. A settlement to the conflict that fails to achieve either would risk the bloc’s own long-term security.Of course  all of this must be managed while ensuring that the Trump administration does not itself further endanger European security by once again casting doubt on its commitment to NATO’s security infrastructure. But Europe has already  if belatedly  begun to wake up to these concerns. By last year  23 NATO members were spending the target 2 percent of GDP on defence  and the alliance agreed a new goal of raising core defence spending to at least 3.5 percent of GDP by 2035  with up to another 1.5 percent of GDP to be spent on critical infrastructure and on expanding their defence industrial bases.AdvertisementMore immediately  Europe has also surpassed the US for the first time since June 2022 in total military aid for Ukraine  with 72 billion euros ($83.6bn) allocated compared with Washington’s 65 billion euros ($75.5bn) by the end of April  according to the Ukraine Support Tracker.Yet  regardless of the outcome of the Trump administration’s efforts to push Ukraine towards a negotiating position that Putin might be willing to accept  the increased European support is not enough to offset the standstill in US funding. Military aid is also only one part of the picture: Kyiv is dependent on the West’s fiscal aid as well  to ensure the continued functioning of its government. And the bill for reconstruction only continues to grow as Russia’s assaults and aerial attacks continue. In February  the World Bank estimated it at $524bn (506 billion euros) —about 280 percent of Kyiv’s 2024 GDP.Without dramatic action  Europe risks being left to Trump’s whims as to its future security  despite having bowed to his demands not only on NATO spending and military support for Ukraine  but also on trade through agreements that have seen the US’s average tariff rate on imports from the EU and UK rise sharply.But there is a clear policy choice that Europe can make to ensure that financial support for Kyiv remains sufficient over the coming years and to shape the outcome of any settlement to the conflict  while simultaneously further deterring Putin.The European Union and the United Kingdom can move to confiscate the sovereign Russian funds frozen in their jurisdictions since 2022. Most importantly  they can seize the 185 billion euros ($214.8bn) frozen at the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear – the majority of which is now in cash and can thus rapidly be deployed or reinvested – as well as the Russian government funds frozen at Euroclear’s Luxembourg-based rival  Clearstream  which are estimated to amount to around 20 billion euros ($23.2bn).Europe is not unaware of this possibility  and in fact  it has been debating doing so for months. The Euroclear assets have already been used to underpin an earlier $50bn (43 billion euros) loan to Ukraine finalised in January 2025  which is secured over earnings from those assets.Europe had been expected to advance a plan to create a new loan – one amounting to as much as 140 billion euros ($162.6bn) – secured over the assets at the European Council meeting on December 18-19  after delaying a final decision at the previous council meeting on October 23. The delay was largely due to obstinacy from the Belgian government  which has demanded indemnification from the rest of Europe while endorsing Kremlin talking points that such a move would be unprecedented.AdvertisementYet there is ample precedent. German and Japanese government assets were seized by the United States in the course of the second world war. In the latter case  Japan’s assets were even frozen before the attack on Pearl Harbour  the majority of which were later retained under the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951.The Kremlin’s threats to tie up Belgium in decades-long litigation are also overblown. They rely on a pre-Soviet-collapse bilateral investment treaty that Putin and his proxies have already failed to invoke successfully to unfreeze their assets or challenge previous sanctions. Additionally  there are dozens of unresolved claims worth tens of billions of dollars against Russia in European courts — including the roughly 13-billion-euro ($15bn) arbitration award won by energy firm Uniper against Gazprom for disruption to gas supplies in 2022. The largest and most significant case remains the 2014 award to former shareholders of Yukos  over the Kremlin’s expropriation of their company. That award survived all appeals: in October 2025  the Supreme Court of the Netherlands rejected Russia’s final challenge  confirming that the award — now valued at more than $65bn  including interest — is final and enforceable against Russian state assets worldwide. Enforcement  however  will still depend on locating suitable Russian assets that courts are willing and able to seize.The Kremlin will certainly engage in lawfare and litigation over these disputes  as it has repeatedly throughout Putin’s tenure. But it will lose  and when its national interests are at stake  it will pay. Russia has repeatedly complied with adverse rulings when vital access to Western markets or assets was at stake. The only clear-cut cases of either the West or Russia returning funds owed as a result of litigation arising from Russia’s war have been the settlements paid by Russian state insurer NSK and aviation firm Aeroflot over Putin’s 2022 seizure of aircraft leased from Western companies.There is no excuse for Europe’s delays in acting thus far. Every month of inaction increases both the financial burden on Europe and the likelihood that Washington will strike a deal that sidelines European interests. The question is now a critical one: how to ensure Ukraine’s continued financing and its ability to sustain its defence. It is also all the more important that Europe act before the Trump Administration tries to secure a deal with the Kremlin over its head.The 28-point “peace plan” formulated by Kremlin insiders and signed off by Trump’s special envoy and long-time associate Steve Witkoff last month not only includes carving up these same frozen funds and even demands that Europe itself provide a further $100 billion  but would also divert frozen Russian assets away from Ukraine’s reconstruction while imposing an additional financial burden directly on Europe. Such a deal would leave Europe footing an even larger bill if the Kremlin fails to adhere to its commitments — as it did with the ceasefire agreements struck in 2014 and 2015 following its initial invasion of Ukraine.AdvertisementEurope has the leverage to advance its political  economic and military security in the negotiations over Ukraine’s future  and it must not be afraid to use it.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.,negative,0.02,0.29,0.7,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'earlier $50bn (43 billion euros) loan', 'San Francisco Peace Treaty', 'Soviet-collapse bilateral investment treaty', '13-billion-euro ($15bn) arbitration award', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'sovereign Russian funds', 'average tariff rate', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'Russian government funds', 'clear policy choice', 'previous council meeting', 'Kremlin talking points', 'second world war', 'defence industrial bases', 'European Council meeting', 'longstanding international principles', 'full-scale war Russia', 'total military aid', 'The European Union', 'The Trump administration', 'Japanese government assets', 'core defence spending', 'Ukraine Support Tracker', 'The Euroclear assets', 'new loan', 'The Kremlin', '72 billion euros', '65 billion euros', '6 billion euros', '185 billion euros', '140 billion euros', 'European support', 'foreign policy', 'World Bank', 'military support', 'previous sanctions', 'fiscal aid', 'European courts', 'military occupation', 'financial support', 'Belgian government', 'NATO spending', 'territorial integrity', 'European security', 'last year', 'new goal', 'critical infrastructure', 'first time', 'negotiating position', 'one part', 'continued functioning', 'aerial attacks', 'dramatic action', 'coming years', 'United Kingdom', 'Luxembourg-based rival', 'final decision', 'ample precedent', 'United States', 'latter case', 'Pearl Harbour', 'decades-long litigation', 'unresolved claims', 'energy firm', 'long-term security', 'security infrastructure', '23 NATO members', 'political concerns', 'US funding', 'target 2 percent', 'future security', '20 billion', '3.5 percent', '1.5 percent', '280 percent', 'extension', 'matters', 'sovereignty', 'Washington', 'deal', 'February', 'recognition', 'territory', 'stake', 'aggression', 'bloc', 'settlement', 'conflict', 'doubt', 'commitment', 'GDP', 'alliance', 'Advertisement', 'June', 'April', 'outcome', 'efforts', 'standstill', 'picture', 'Kyiv', 'West', 'reconstruction', 'assaults', 'whims', 'demands', 'trade', 'agreements', 'imports', 'jurisdictions', 'majority', 'cash', 'Clearstream', 'possibility', 'fact', 'months', 'January', 'earnings', 'plan', 'December', 'October', 'delay', 'obstinacy', 'indemnification', 'rest', 'move', 'German', 'course', 'threats', 'proxies', 'dozens', 'billions', 'dollars']",2025-12-02,2025-12-03,aljazeera.com

The financing of the plant’s construction  estimated at €115 million  will be covered 30% by equity and 70% by debt  with all debt guaranteed by Wankai.The plant will be located in Haining (Zhejiang province) on site provided by Wankai  which is already equipped with infrastructure (equipment  waste treatment  etc.)  thus reducing the investment cost. Construction is expected to begin during the first quarter of 2026  with commissioning targeted by the first quarter of 2027.CARBIOS and Wankai have also approved on 2 December 2025 the license agreement  which will be granted by CARBIOS to the joint venture upon its incorporation.CARBIOS and Wankai have committed to a long-term partnership with the ambition to build and operate several PET biorecycling plants in Asia. CARBIOS agrees to exclusively license its PET depolymerization technology in Asia to Wankai for a period of three years  subject to signing licenses with the latter for at least 100 kt per year of additional capacity. This term will be extended in five-year increments if additional licenses for at least 200 kt per year of extra capacity are signed.To strengthen the strategic partnership between the two companies  Wankai has committed to subscribe  before 2 June 2026  to a dedicated capital increase of €5 million in the share capital of CARBIOS S.A.3  paid on the basis of an issue price per share of €8.0947  corresponding to the volume-weighted average of the last five trading days preceding the 1st of December 2025  reduced by a 10% discount.Vincent Kamel  CEO of CARBIOS: « The signing of this agreement marks the achievement of a major strategic partnership with Zhink Group.

This product was developed using Biotalys’ AGROBODY™ technology platform and is the first protein-based biofungicide of its kind to be approved by the EPA.EVOCA is a precision biocontrol solution with a new mode of action** that targets the fungal pathogens botrytis (grey mold) and powdery mildew in high-value fruits and vegetables while minimising the risk to beneficial organisms or the environment.With this approval in hand  Biotalys can proceed with the dossiers for state registrations in California and Florida  two of the most important growing regions for fruit and vegetables in the United States***. In Europe  EVOCA has entered the peer review phase  and the Netherlands – as the rapporteur member state – has proposed approval in Europe  subject to the provision for certain additional data as requested during the peer review phase.Additionally  the company can move forward with building up the U.S. regulatory submission for EVOCA NG – its next-generation product – currently in the final phases of development. The regulatory review process for EVOCA NG is expected to be significantly shorter  as the product contains the same active ingredient as EVOCA and features enhanced formulation and production methods.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a global automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections  today announces its 2025 third quarter and nine-month consolidated revenue (period ended on 31 October 2025).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated:“Quadient delivered another strong performance in Digital and Lockers  with both Solutions reaching double-digit growth in subscription-related revenue since the beginning of the year and now accounting for 40% of total subscription-related revenue. In Q3 2025  Digital organic revenue growth was +9.2%  maintaining robust subscription uptake across regions. Our Lockers business maintained strong double-digit growth in subscription-related revenue  supported by rising adoption of lockers in the UK. Meanwhile  Mail remained in line with prior-quarter trends  the expected rebound in US hardware sales being delayed to Q4. Combined with anticipated year-on-year full-year EBITDA margin improvement in Digital and Lockers  as well as resilience in Mail EBITDA margin  these results reinforce our confidence in achieving our full‑year 2025 guidance(1).Quadient leadership in SaaS-based solutions for automated business and communication processes has been further validated by IDC ranking us No. 1 worldwide in Customer Communications Management (CCM) with an 11% market share  capturing the largest share of global market growth. Meanwhile  the upcoming closing of the acquisition of CDP Communications  an innovator in document accessibility and automation  will further strengthens our leading CCM position.”Comments on Q3 and 9M 2025 performanceQuadient sales came in at €765 million in 9M 2025  down 3.1% organically and down 4.0% on a reported basis  compared to 9M 2024. Reported growth includes a positive scope effect of €13 million  related to the acquisition of Package Concierge in December 2024 and  to a lesser extent  Serensia in June 2025. This was more than offset by a negative currency impact of€19 million during the period. In Q3 2025  revenue came at €248 million  down 3.5% organically and down 5.6% on a reported basis compared to Q3 2024.Subscription-related revenue (€569 million  74% of total sales) increased by 0.8% organically against 9M 2024  supported by strong momentum in Digital and Lockers  both delivering double-digit growth in subscription-related revenue over the first nine months of 2025. Non-recurring revenue declined by 13.0% organically  with North America representing more than 80% of the decrease  mainly due to lower product placements.By geography  North America (58% of revenue) declined organically by 3.7%  a sharp contrast compared to past trends of consistent growth since Covid. This was mainly driven by the low US mail equipment renewal cycle following the latest decertification. The Main European countries (34% of revenue) recorded a 3.2% organic decline  with a notable positive trend in the UK region. The International segment (8% of revenue) was up 1.2% organically.Revenue by SolutionQ3 2025 consolidated revenueIn € million Q3 2025 Q3 2024 Change Organic change Digital 69 65 +6.8% +9.2% Mail 151 175 (13.2)% (9.8)% Lockers 28 24 +16.7% +6.1% Group total 248 263 (5.6)% (3.5)%9M 2025 consolidated revenueIn € million 9M 2025 9M 2024 Change Organic change Digital 206 194 +6.0% +7.9% Mail 476 536 (11.2)% (9.0)% Lockers 84 67 +25.4% +9.4% Group total 765 797 (4.0)% (3.1)%DigitalIn 9M 2025  revenue from Digital reached €206 million  up 7.9% organically and 6.0% on a reported basis (including Serensia acquisition scope effect) compared to 9M 2024.This solid performance was fueled by a strong 10.0% organic growth in subscription-related revenue  with particularly good momentum in North America and the United Kingdom. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 84% of Digital total sales in 9M 2025  up from 83% in 9M 2024.In Q3 2025  Digital accelerated its organic revenue growth  posting a 9.2% year-on-year increase. This performance was driven by sustained subscription growth across all regions and a double-digit growth in non-recurring revenue  reflecting a higher number of license deals and stronger professional services.At the end of October 2025  annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €242 million(2)  representing an annualized 9.1% organic growth over the first nine months of the year.During the quarter  IDC ranked Quadient as the No. 1 global provider of Customer Communications Management (CCM) solutions  with an 11% market share in 2024. Meanwhile  EY and Numeum recognized Quadient among the Top 3 French software publishers in “Horizontal Solutions” and 17th overall in the Top 250. These achievements underscore Quadient’s leadership in SaaS solutions for business process and communication management  a leadership further validated by nearly 1 650 new customers gained in the past nine months.Quadient is further strengthening its CCM portfolio and reinforcing its leadership position with the acquisition of CDP Communications  a long-standing Canadian partner and one of the most innovative players in document accessibility and automation. This move reinforces Quadient’s commitment to digital innovation and to delivering advanced CCM technology that prioritizes accessibility in every communication. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Digital EBITDA margin. The agreement was signed on 20 November 2025  with closing expected in December 2025.It is the company’s second acquisition this year  following Serensia  which is complementing Quadient’s financial automation offer. Serensia by Quadient passed all tests and awaits official accreditation from the French Tax Authority (DGFIP)  ahead of France’s national e-invoicing rollout. Serensia by Quadient continues to see strong commercial traction  adding in the quarter 50 million invoices to be processed annually  on top of more than 215 million invoices per year already secured for processing by 2026.MailMail revenue reached €476 million in 9M 2025  down 9.0% organically and 11.2% on a reported basis versus 9M 2024.Hardware sales declined 17.3% organically in 9M 2025  with North America representing nearly 80% of the drop in mail equipment placements. This low point reflects the strong comparison base in H1 2024  which had benefited from the decertification boost (ended in Q4 2024). Subscription-related revenue recorded a 5.2% organic decline in 9M 2025and accounted for 72% of Mail total sales in 9M 2025  up from 69% in 9M 2024.In Q3 2025  Mail revenue declined 9.8% organically  reflecting a 16.7% drop in hardware sales  mainly due to the limited recovery in the US. Subscription-related revenue also decreased  impacted by a strong comparison base following last year’s rate changes in Germany and in the Nordics  with no similar adjustment in 2025.Quadient is seeing encouraging signs of market recovery in mail hardware sales  supported by improved trends in demand. The pipeline for Q4 2025 is tracking ahead of Q3 2025  and renewal opportunities for 2026 are higher than in 2025. Quadient continues to benefit from a dynamic market for large mail production sites  securing multiple significant deals in Europe and North America.Cross-sell momentum with Digital remains solid  with nine-month growth of 22% year-on-year  including a surge in financial automation bookings over the same period. In Q3 2025  Quadient also secured a major US federal agency deal  worth approximately USD1 million in Q3 2025.During the quarter  Quadient launched its next-generation Smart Mailing solutions in the UK. The new iX-Series (4-6-8)  combining hardware and software innovation  marks a major step in mail management’s digital transformation  offering intuitive design  faster access to information  and seamless integration with Quadient’s cloud-based ecosystem.LockersLockers revenue reached €84 million in 9M 2025  a 9.4% increase on an organic basis. The reported growth stood at 25.4% year-on-year  including the positive contribution from Package Concierge (€12 million in 9M 2025).Subscription-related revenue increased by 16.1% organically in 9M 2025 while non-recurring revenue declined by 1.4% organically over the same period  driven by softer performance in North America. Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 65% of total revenue in 9M 2025 (up from 64% in 9M 2024).In Q3 2025  subscription-related organic revenue growth accelerated to 17.6%  benefiting from:an outstanding volume ramp-up in the UK;a continued solid momentum in the US  driven by higher monetization of usage fees;the growing usage in Japan.Non-recurring revenue declined by 11.3% organically in Q3 2025  mostly due to high comparison basis.Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.27 100 units at the end of 9M 2025  adding around 500 new lockers in Q3 2025. Overall  the UK and French open networks have  together  expanded more than threefold since January 2024.As part of its European expansion  Quadient has launched an open locker network in Italy  a country with high potential for network development. To ensure broad adoption  Quadient is establishing strong partnerships with major carriers and retailers and plans to install lockers in high-traffic locations. This strategy is illustrated by a five-year agreement with GLS Italy  which will expand its collection point network nationwide by leveraging hundreds of Quadient carrier-agnostic lockers to be deployed over the coming years  starting in key regions of Central and Northern Italy.As part of its customer expansion strategy  both pick-up and drop-off volumes in the French and UK open networks have surged  growing twentyfold since January 2024. North America’s lockers network continues to show strong momentum  while volumes in Japan have been steadily increasing since Q3 2025.FY 2025 GUIDANCEQuadient reaffirms its full-year 2025 guidance  as updated on 24 September 2025:FY 2025 revenue is expected to decline by a low single digit on an organic basis;FY 2025 current EBIT is anticipated to range from stable to low single digit decline on an organic basis.CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCASTQuadient will host a conference call and webcast today at 6:00 pm Paris time (5:00 pm London time).To join the webcast  click on the following link: Webcast.To listen to the presentation by phone  please register using the following link to receive the dial-in details: Conference call.A replay of the webcast will also be available on Quadient’s Investor Relations website for 12 months.Calendar25 March 2026 : Q4 sales and full-year 2025 results release (after close of trading on the Euronext Paris regulated market).About Quadient®Quadient is a global automation platform provider powering secure and sustainable business connections through digital and physical channels.

This plan has been reinforced over the past weeks in response to FDA’s observations1.Guerbet always puts the patient front and centre of its commitments and affirm its determination to ensure production meets the highest regulatory and quality standards.Guerbet mobilised human  financial and technical internal resources and hired external experts to conduct comprehensive assessments and take other interim measures under the compliance plan  in alignment with FDA guidance to industry. The implementation of the compliance plan has delayed the release of batches manufactured at the site  and this is expected to result in a loss of revenue for the Group in the 2025 financial year. The implementation of compliance plan activities will also give rise to exceptional costs.Under these conditions  Guerbet will not be able to meet its 2025 targets and now anticipates:A decrease in revenue of between -4 % and -5 % at constant exchange rates and on a like-for-like basis  compared with a slight decrease of -1% previously announced;A restated EBITDA margin of between 10 5% and 12% of revenue  compared with between 12% and 13% previously announced;Free cash flow of between -5M€ and -15M€  versus slightly negative previously announcedThe operational consequences and financial impact for the 2026 financial year are currently being analysed. The company will inform the market as soon as it has additional information.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better. That is our purpose. We are a global leader in medical imaging  offering a comprehensive range of pharmaceutical products  medical devices  and digital and AI solutions for diagnostic and interventional imaging. As pioneers in contrast products for 99 years  with more than 2 905 employees worldwide  we continuously innovate and devote 9% of our revenue to Research and Development in four centers in France and the United States.

Fiscal discipline  at this moment  for Greece  I would say it is an acquisition that concerns a whole generation. The prime minister said at the conference that he does not intend to pass the bill on to the next generation. None of us intends to pass the bill on to the next generation ” the minister said.“Fiscal discipline for us is an engine of growth ” Pierrakakis clarified  stressing that the next step in unleashing the country’s growth forces is through the EU and is none other than the completion of the Savings and Investment Union.“I would say that  perhaps  it will be the biggest missed opportunity of our generation in Europe if we fail to realise it. And the failure to realise it is due  to a certain extent  to national sensitivities. We all agree  but we all proceed with national asterisks. We all express our points of concern.”Pierrakakis referred to the need for the European Union to move immediately to actions that support the vision of the Savings and Investment Union  citing the example of Greece. “Euronext for us is the ultimate step in this direction.”“In Europe  instead of thinking about where to focus  we need to focus on our ‘champions’. We should focus on the areas where we are close to the technological cutting edge. We should remove the barriers to this market. Exercise industrial policy in that market.”Stephane Boujnah: The integration of HA with the Euronext single market is a natural progression“Today  ten years later  all the countries that were once called PIGS are borrowing cheaper than France and the UK ” said Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah.He said the integration of the Greek capital market into Euronext’s single market  and the entire ecosystem around it  was a natural progression in a country that produces more than it can absorb.“What we are trying to do is to correct a major anomaly ” he added. “There was something obsolete in Greece: markets were too isolated.And just as Greece produces far more financial talent than it can absorb  there was this paradox: that a great company  with great people  that has made such an impressive recovery  remained isolated.”In the same vein as the Minister  Mr Boujnah stressed that “the recipe for success for anything we want to achieve in Europe can be summed up in two words: Scale and speed. What we are trying to do with Kyriakos Pierrakakis is to solve the problem of speed. What we need now is to achieve scale.”Today  Euronext’s single European market reaches €6.5 trillion in total market capitalisation  more than twice the size of the London market  according to Mr Boujnah.“What we will do is to put the Greek capital markets  and the whole ecosystem around them  into this framework ” the Euronext CEO concluded.,neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,mixed,0.28,0.18,0.54,True,English,"['Greek stock exchange', 'business growth', 'Pierrakakis', 'Euronext', 'acquisition', 'catalyst', 'Morgan Stanley investment roadshow', 'Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'biggest missed opportunity', 'technological cutting edge', 'Greek stock exchange', 'total market capitalisation', 'EU member states', 'Greek capital market', 'single European market', 'Euronext single market', 'Greek businesses', 'Greek economy', 'Investment Union', 'Mr Boujnah', 'European Union', 'institutional changes', 'cross-border mergers', 'National Economy', 'wider pool', 'many ways', 'multiple levels', 'other things', 'collective trauma', 'Fiscal discipline', 'next step', 'national sensitivities', 'national asterisks', 'ultimate step', 'industrial policy', 'natural progression', 'major anomaly', 'financial talent', 'great company', 'great people', 'impressive recovery', 'same vein', 'two words', 'European “champions', 'London market', 'success stories', 'policy change', 'next generation', 'entire ecosystem', 'Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'prime minister', 'growth forces', 'markets', 'Newsroom', 'Savings', 'regulations', 'mindset', 'acquisitions', 'Athens', 'part', 'network', 'Finance', 'discussion', 'access', 'liquidity', 'catalyst', 'removal', 'barriers', 'need', 'Greece', 'crisis', 'moment', 'conference', 'bill', 'None', 'engine', 'country', 'completion', 'failure', 'extent', 'points', 'concern', 'actions', 'vision', 'example', 'direction', 'areas', 'integration', 'countries', 'France', 'UK', 'something', 'paradox', 'recipe', 'Scale', 'speed', 'problem', 'size', 'framework']",2025-12-02,2025-12-03,en.protothema.gr

Today I’ll start with the farmers’ demonstrations  and especially with their very bad habit of blocking the roads  because of course they can do whatever they want  choose any other form of protest  but not TORTURE the rest of the citizens of this country. You’ll say  “No other method exists that bothers the government except blocking the roads and highways ” but I repeat: the ones who “eat” the hassle are society  not a few ministers. So this whole story  “I block a road and harm my fellow citizen ” which I recall every year around this time until mid-January—when our beloved farmers leave the cafés and go back to work—must at some point stop. I’m told that today  as Mitsotakis will be in his office—he’s returning from London—he’ll deal with the problem. After all  spokesperson Marinakis already said so during the briefing. They may even meet in person with Chrysochoidis about the measures the Police will take.Mitsotakis with investors–Apart from the public discussion at the Stock Exchange and Morgan Stanley event  K.M also sat down for an in-depth closed roundtable with serious investors before leaving for Oxford. Speaking about the overall performance of the Greek economy  he said we’re taking support measures without risking fiscal stability  and he referred to the tax cuts as well. He repeated to them (although they already knew) that he will complete the four-year term and that he wants to be judged at the end for fulfilling his commitments  even making a comparison between ND’s polling lead and the situation in other European elections. And he stressed that political stability and its importance will be a key parameter in the electoral strategy.Breakfast with Pierr–At the rest of the investment conference in London  the spotlight has been on the banks and of course on energy and construction. Bankers in particular referred to the very positive performance of their shares  as analysts continue to focus mainly on dividends  which will naturally arise from credit expansion as well as from the other activities of the credit institutions. In this regard  Vassilis Psaltis’ remark stood out that Alpha Bank’s capital adequacy gives ample room for supplementary acquisitions  while the goal is roughly a 10% increase in earnings per share in the coming years.As for Piraeus Bank  the discussion about Ethniki Asfalistiki naturally took up a significant part of the talk; for Eurobank  its international exposure and diversified results—with Bulgaria’s contribution—were central; while for National Bank  its high capital levels remain a major topic.Today’s program includes a morning breakfast between Finance Minister K. Pierrakakis and investors  followed right after by a discussion with Stéphane Boujnah  CEO of Euronext  and a banking-system panel featuring Ch. Papakonstantinou (Bank of Greece) and E. Vrettou (CrediaBank).This  however  will be the last conference organized by the ASE together with Morgan Stanley  since as of next year HELEX will be part of Euronext  which is implementing its own overall strategy for promoting its markets—while the Greek Stock Exchange will most likely belong to the Developed Markets category  according to FTSE/Russell. And if  by this time next year  Greece has managed to repay part of its Public Debt early  any investment conference in 2026 will take place under different conditions and with different participants.The Greek file for SAFE–The files submitted by European states for funding through the EU SAFE instrument have now formally closed  and of course Greece filed its plan  which is based on priorities. I hear that while roughly €1.15 billion in loans is allocated to us  the Greek file contains potential financing of over €2 billion  in the hope that some countries will not use their available funds and those will be redirected to other applicants.The Greek file contains innovation-oriented defense projects  such as drone systems and the anti-drone “dome ” and not vehicles etc. And it places special emphasis on the active participation of the defense industry in the program  as well as on government-to-government (G2G) collaborations—for example  regarding the Greek drone “Centaur.”Adonis’ “like” to Petros Pappas–Among the interesting “backstage politics” of the day is Adonis’ thank-you post to PASOK MP Petros Pappas  who had been elected with SYRIZA  and who at some event… showered the minister with praise for his hard work and efforts in Health. I didn’t find it bad at all  but it was certainly off PASOK’s party line given everything little-leader Nikos A. says. I’m waiting to see how those civilized people over at the Movement will react.Already  Haris Kastanidis took a jab at him  saying that compared to what Papavassileiou (director of Androulakis’ office for a few hours) had said  maybe we were unfair to him (Papavassileiou  that is). Kastanidis of course felt the need to react because Petros Pappas is slated as a candidate in Thessaloniki’s 2nd District  and although Haris is from the 1st District  he said “he’ll be in my way  so go ahead and hit him once just in case.” Later  obviously upon guidance  Pappas walked his comments back a bit by posting only one excerpt from his speech where he criticized the National Health System—but the… damage was done.Papastavrou’s meetings in Washington–Tomorrow  Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou heads to Washington  where he will meet with his counterparts and our familiar contacts from PTEC  Doug Burgum and Chris Wright. In fact  he will be meeting the U.S. Interior Secretary and head of America’s Energy Sovereignty Council for the fourth time in the past six months  and Chris Wright for the third time in the same period. There is no clearer indication of the momentum the Greece–U.S. energy relationship is developing  and there is also an established personal rapport.At the same time  I hear that Papastavrou will have a lunch with Greek-American lawmakers Gus Bilirakis  Dina Titus  and Jimmy Patronis to promote national developments in the energy sector. Another important meeting will be with Senator Chuck Fleischmann  chairman of the energy subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee—that is  the committee that unlocks the funding for the development of the East Med Energy Center  which our country is pursuing. Finally  on Wednesday he will end his day with meetings with the American-Jewish organizations AIPAC and AJC.Tsipras – book and MPs–One day to go before the presentation of Tsipras’ book  and I asked whether the organizers expect among the guests at the Pallas theater—which holds 1 500 people—any MPs from SYRIZA  from New Left  or from Kasselakis’ camp. The answer I got was that technically  no one knows  since entrance is free and there’s no seating arrangement  but they consider it certain that MPs from SYRIZA and New Left will show up  but mainly the roughly 25 independent—adrift—MPs roaming around Parliament. As you can understand  the fiesta goes on…Piraeus Bank “speaks well” with Euroxx–I don’t know  maybe it’s that with Euronext now the conditions for brokerage firms are changing. Maybe it’s the banks’ hunt to boost non-interest income. Maybe it’s also that the headache over the National Insurance procedures is finally over. Whatever the case  the point is that this time—because we’ve had plenty of talk in the past—Piraeus Bank is “taking a good hard look” at Euroxx  the biggest non-bank brokerage. Some say it’s a done deal; I’m still holding my reservations…Airbus keeping airlines on “sit-down / stand-up” mode–First came the issue with the software and solar radiation that cropped up late last week. Now there’s a new problem: an industrial-quality issue affecting the fuselage panel of a few dozen new A320-family aircraft slated for delivery in the coming period  based on orders the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer has received so far. We’re talking about Airbus  which currently has airlines on “sit” and “stand ” with this new (possible) issue potentially delaying upcoming aircraft deliveries—although already-in-service aircraft are not affected.From what was known until yesterday  even Airbus itself has not yet concluded how many planes it will ultimately be able to deliver by year-end. The company’s target for all of 2025 is around 820 aircraft  having delivered 657 in the first eleven months  while in November alone it delivered a (small) 72 planes—making the record of another 160 by year-end look rather unlikely.As for our own  the largest domestic airline  AEGEAN  which has placed the major order of up to 60 aircraft for fleet renewal  has already received 38 since the start of the order  while for the period from September 2025 to September 2026  delivery of another ten is expected  two of which have already been delivered.The Lamda – Cosmote Telekom deal–The agreement sealed between Cosmote Telekom and the OTE Group with Lamda Development for the development and operation of a fiber-optic network in Ellinikon is of exceptional importance. Practically  throughout The Ellinikon site  telecom services will bear OTE’s stamp: any company or private individual wanting fiber will get it from OTE  and for those wanting a different provider  OTE will sell wholesale access.And that’s not all—the two companies will also develop joint retail services  offering fixed and mobile telephony plans as well as subscription TV exclusively for residents and businesses of The Ellinikon. Additionally  there will be ICT solutions for enterprises and a complete ecosystem of digital services. The project will begin immediately to support the goal of creating a smart city designed and built entirely from scratch.TOP Ships shifts toward Dubai real estate–The stock-market announcement by TOP Ships  owned by Evangelos Pistiolis  that it signed a letter of intent for a potential acquisition of residential units in Dubai sparked discussion among Wall Street analysts. The move is viewed as a parallel activity relative to the company’s core shipping business  but the size of the portfolio—over $200 million—does not go unnoticed.Details of the agreement show that TOP Ships secured exclusive rights and an option to purchase the properties at a 10% discount to fair value  as determined by two independent valuations. The $23.5 million advance payment  due by end-2025  is seen by the market as a sign that the company is seriously considering expanding its presence beyond tankers.More cautious observers  however  note that the special independent committee still has a long way to go. The 90-day due-diligence period will determine whether the option will ultimately be exercised  with no assurance that the transaction will be completed. On Wall Street  the move is interpreted as an attempt to seize opportunities in one of the world’s most resilient real-estate markets—without altering the company’s primary character as a shipping player.The Polemis family and the Saudi Arabia–Syria deal–Polembros Shipping  owned by Spyros and Leonidas Polemis  with the suezmax Reliable Warrior (150 000 dwt  built 2017)  decided to bypass the usual risks and sail through the Red Sea to speed up delivery of one million barrels of Saudi crude to the port of Baniyas in Syria. AIS data show departure from Ras Tanura on November 9 and arrival in Syria on Monday.The move is particularly interesting because listed tanker companies still avoid the Red Sea—even though Houthi attacks have subsided—while major container companies such as CMA CGM and Maersk are considering returning after the Gaza ceasefire.The delivery is the second and final part of the Saudi Arabia–Syria agreement aiming to boost the latter’s energy sector. More specifically  the sequence of deliveries from public and private interests—like George Economou’s Cardiff Marine (Petalidi  650 000 barrels)—as well as the involvement of sanctioned Russian vessels  reveals a complex web of geopolitical and economic pressures: Saudi deals  Syria’s urgent energy needs  and the tacit tolerance or indirect facilitation by major shipping markets create a mosaic of risks and gains for participants.MSC  Greek shipowners  and the hunt for old container ships–Anyone following container-ship sale-and-purchase activity will have already realized that MSC  the world’s top liner company  owned by the family of Gianluigi Aponte  is moving aggressively. The latest rumor regarding the purchase of the 22-year-old Irenes Resolve from Tsakos Shipping & Trading for $23 million is only the newest episode in a long line of deals.A shipbroker pointed out to me that this story has everything: a 2001-built vessel  and a prime moment for Greek shipowners wanting to sell “aged” tonnage at eye-popping prices. It’s no coincidence that MSC has bought 20 ships from 10 different Greeks in two years—15 of them just this year.These transactions show that Greek shipowners have found in Aponte a buyer capable of lifting the value of old vessels to levels unimaginable a few years ago. It’s also interesting that the Tsakos group—best known for its tankers—now sees its niche fleet of sub-panamax container ships becoming a vehicle for strategic monetization  without needing to get tangled in complex newbuilding investments or risk new tonnage.For those watching the market “backstage ” the real story is not the $23 million price for a 22-year-old ship  but the strategy behind selling Greek vessels to MSC: a finely tuned process combining timing and a broker’s eye always scouting for the next opportunity.If the rumor proves true  Irenes Resolve will become the 20th Greek container ship to pass into MSC’s hands in two years.Tsakos  when asked to comment on the rumor  responded that as a private  non-listed company  it does not issue announcements regarding its actions.Four Seasons and Adidas–Even though December has begun  the Four Seasons at Astir (and many other hotels) continues to maintain unusually high occupancy for this season  and will fill up even more in the coming days. Adidas chose Athens for its annual company meeting  where the 2025 recap will be presented and next year’s goals discussed.For this purpose  180 rooms were booked at the Four Seasons  to host senior executives arriving from all over the world. The overall coordination will be handled by Norwegian Bjørn Gulden  who took over as CEO in January 2023  and aside from work there will also be moments of relaxation for the multinational’s executives.Maria Sakkari and top Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar—who played for Manchester United and Juventus  among others—will also attend the Adidas event.Green light for Mitsis’ golf course–The Mitsis Group formally received the “green light” for the modernization of the Afandou golf course in Rhodes  completing the issuance of a new Environmental Terms Approval (ΑΕΠΟ) by the relevant directorates of the Environment Ministry  based on the Environmental Impact Study.The approval was requested and obtained by AFANDOU REAL ESTATE S.A. for the modernization of the 18-hole  500-acre course  its clubhouse  and supporting facilities—without any new construction or other interventions to the existing layout.The new ΑΕΠΟ also specifies water use for irrigation and operation  waste management  etc.  establishing a clear operating framework  given that the golf course is part of a broader investment plan envisioned for the area under the Mitsis Group’s business plan.Institutional interest in Motor Oil–Motor Oil is now flying at “historic altitude ” having surpassed a market cap of €3.2 billion in yesterday’s session. On the 19th—the third Friday of December—the last 2025 Derivatives Contracts expire  while next Tuesday (23/12) the stock will trade ex-dividend for the €0.30/share pre-dividend.The timing creates arbitrage opportunities and hedging strategies that usually precede major corporate announcements  as shown by yesterday’s transactions worth over €7 million.As the year wraps up  Motor Oil—according to reliable information—is preparing to announce a particularly “strong” fourth quarter  attributed to the restructuring of energy flows in the Mediterranean  especially after sanctions on Russian products  while its refinery-upgrade investments have begun yielding higher margins.PeopleCert back on the markets–The first “Greek unicorn ” the first Greek multinational startup in professional and language-skills certifications to surpass €1 billion in valuation—PeopleCert  owned by Byron Nicolaides—has proceeded with a new €300 million senior-secured bond issuance maturing in 2031.The bond is expected to be priced in the 6%–6.25% range and will trade on Euronext Dublin.In early November  PeopleCert announced a major agreement to acquire the entirety of City & Guilds London Institute (CGLI)  the UK’s professional certification body.Morgan Stanley is coordinating the bond process  joined by Deutsche Bank  BofA  Citi  Goldman Sachs  Santander  and Eurobank.After France  Germany’s turn comes–In France  governments fall because the necessary pension reform (mainly raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 and changing the “special regimes” that allowed certain categories to retire earlier) was rejected by the opposition and the unions. France spends 34% of its GDP on the “welfare state.”While France is still searching for a prime minister and government  Germany isn’t faring much better. 31.2% of German GDP goes to benefits. In 1960  the Sozialstaatsquote (welfare-state share) was 18.3%. By 2010 it had reached 30%  after the pandemic 33.4%  and in 2024 it stands at 31.2%.The upward trend continues not only due to population aging  but also due to a series of “benefits” that  while protecting the unemployed  also act as a disincentive to work. The Bürgergeld benefit offers an income comparable to a normal—low—salary.Germany still shows zero growth rates  rising taxation to cover social deficits  and all this amidst the demographic crisis Europe is facing. Any discussion about reforming the German welfare state meets the obvious resistance of powerful unions and an electorate used to things being a certain way.Moreover  the much-vaunted German fiscal discipline demands zero deficits  which limits the state’s ability to invest productively in infrastructure and innovation.The countdown for triggering the German time-bomb has already begun…,positive,0.69,0.31,0.01,mixed,0.21,0.24,0.55,True,English,"['London business deals', 'Tsipras’ book launch', 'M.M', 'national highways', 'Piraeus Bank', 'blockades', 'MPs', 'Euroxx', 'Finance Minister K.
