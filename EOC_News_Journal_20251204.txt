We are with them for the long haul "" said von der Leyen while rolling out the proposal which would use Russian money as collateral to fund Ukraine’s economy and war effort through a “reparations loan.”Von der Leyen said that using the frozen assets would strengthen the Ukrainian position at peace negotiations with Russia and the U.S. but it would also send a message to Moscow that “the prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them.” She said that she had informed the Trump administration about the proposal.Funding UkraineEU leaders have committed to fund Ukraine over the next two years  whatever the method. The EU has already poured in over 170 billion euros ($197 billion) since the war started in 2022.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementVon der Leyen said that if the loan plan didn't pass muster  the bloc could borrow the money on international markets in a scheme underpinned by its long-term budget. The problem here  though  is that it would require the approval of all 27 member countries  and Hungary has consistently blocked aid to Ukraine.The biggest pot of ready funds available is through frozen Russian assets. Most of the money is held in Belgium – around 194 billion euros as of June – and outside the EU in Japan  with around $50 billion  and the U.S.  U.K. and Canada with lesser amounts. A total of 210 billion euros worth ($245 billion) are held in Europe.To address Belgian concerns  the commission's complex proposal includes safeguards to protect EU nations from “possible retaliation from Russia "" a prohibition of any release of the frozen assets  and a way to borrow money as the EU to ""underpin a loan to Ukraine.”Too risky for BelgiumAdvertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementBut Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that his country considers “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky. It has never been done before.” Russia has described the scheme as “theft.”Haltingly reading prepared remarks to reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels  Prévot urged the EU to borrow the money for Ukraine on international markets. “It is a well-known  a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters ” he said.“The reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks ” he said  adding that the commission’s proposals do not address Belgium’s concerns. “It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks.”Belgium fears that the Brussels-based financial clearing house holding the frozen assets  Euroclear  could take legal action if Russia challenges any use of the funds or if the move harms its image and business interests.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement AdvertisementPrévot said Belgium feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return ” he said.EU partners say they're listeningIn essence  the 90 billion euros would not be seized from Russia as such  as Kyiv would refund it once Moscow pays significant reparations for the massive destruction its war has caused. Should Moscow refuse  the assets would remain frozen.Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement Advertisement“We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns  and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal ” Von der Leyen said. “We will share the burden in a fair way  as it is the European way.”Other EU partners insist that they too understand Belgium's worries.“We take Belgium’s concerns seriously ” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters. “They are justified  but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”His Dutch counterpart David van Weel underlined that “these funds are really  really important. We need to support the Ukrainian economy  otherwise they will have a very tough time next year.”Advertisement AdvertisementAdvertisement Advertisement“We understand the Belgian concerns  and we are willing to at least make sure that they are not alone in this ” he said. Several EU countries have already agreed to provide financial guarantees should things go wrong.Belgium has been earning some tax income on the assets  and the interest raised is also being used to fund a loan program for Ukraine organized by the Group of Seven major world powers.The European Central Bank is worried that the plan for an EU reparation loan could undermine confidence in the euro single currency on international markets.

53992,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/628892-frozen-assets-eu-stealing/,Cashing in on war: Why stealing Russia’s assets actually makes things worse for the EU,The EU’s plot to use Russian funds to finance Kiev is going to backfire on all parties involved in the illegal seizure Read Full Article at RT.com,For bloc taxpayers  it could mean Brussels has walked them into a fait accompli where they simply have to stump up for funding a corrupt regime in KievAfter a week of humiliation in which her much-touted plot to sequester Russian assets to fund Kiev’s war chest was outright rejected by both Belgium and the European Central Bank  European Commission boss Ursula von der Leyen has told EU member states they have two choices  both of which would send cash to Kiev’s coffers.According to the embattled EC president  either EU countries will have to borrow cash for Ukraine and make their taxpayers foot the bill  or allow her to push through her – potentially illegal – “reparations plan” and kick the repayment can down the road.Let’s take a look at what all the talk is about.Russia’s frozen assets: How much is where?It is known that Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear holds some €180 billion in Russian central-bank funds. Reports that Luxembourg held some €20 billion in Russian assets was denied by the country itself  which claimed it holds “less than €10 000.”Switzerland  which is in neither the EU nor G7 and thus not subject to von der Leyen’s demands  has declared some 7.45 billion Swiss Francs (€8 billion). Germany has refused to disclose what it holds  citing data protection laws. Japan is thought to hold some €30 billion  while former French Finance Minister Bruno de Maire has spoken about immobilizing some €22.8 billion. The US is believed to hold around $5 billion.What are the Russian assets frozen in the EU?The assets mainly consist of European short- and mid-duration bonds that have mostly already come due. When the bonds matured  the principal was paid. Because Euroclear wasn’t prepared to hold that much money itself  the proceeds were invested by Euroclear’s house bank in an account at the European Central Bank. The money is earning interest that legally belongs to Euroclear  although in ordinary circumstances the clearinghouse would send those funds (minus fees) to the client (the Russian central bank).What is the proposed reparations loan?The plan entails the EU loaning Ukraine up to €140 billion using the Russian assets as collateral. Technically  this would involve Euroclear making an interest-free loan of the same value as the Russian assets it holds.The EU would sign for the cash and give it to Kiev where it would ostensibly be used to fight the war and cover budget expenses  although past experience indicates that much of it could end up in offshore accounts belonging to insiders close to Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.The sweetener for Kiev is that Ukraine only has to pay back the EU in the highly unlikely event that Russia loses the war and agrees to pay Ukraine reparations.In that case  Kiev would then have to pass those reparations back to Brussels  which would pay back Euroclear  which  in turn  would be able to honor its liability to the Russian central bank.Why is Belgium afraid to go through with the scheme?Although Euroclear is a private institution  it is domiciled in Belgium  which could be on the hook if things do not go according to plan. First of all  Belgium has a long-standing investment treaty with Russia that provides for arbitration in the event of any dispute between the parties. Belgium fears that the very moment the cash leaves Euroclear Moscow could retaliate against Belgian assets in Russia and may also initiate litigation.Also  if a peace deal includes sanctions relief for Russia without reparations  somebody would have to come up with a very significant sum of cash. Despite much lobbying  Belgium received no convincing statements of support from EU members  and ultimately rejected von Der Leyen’s plan as the “worst of all” solutions for Kiev. Despite significant pressure from von der Leyen  Belgium has continued to resist the move  seeing the risks as unacceptably high.If things go wrong  would Euroclear be liable for the Russian reserves?It’s important to understand that Euroclear’s custodian business works under a fundamentally different model from a bank (although Euroclear does have a banking business). Whereas a bank takes deposits as liabilities and lends or invests them as assets  Euroclear holds client assets off balance sheet in safekeeping. Client assets are kept legally separate (segregated) from the custodian’s own assets  meaning that if something goes wrong  the client has a proprietary right to the assets  not merely an unsecured claim.Since theoretically nothing should ever happen to assets that aren’t lent out or invested  a custodian such as Euroclear is not well equipped to handle liability for a client’s assets.It’s also unlikely that Euroclear itself could be ultimately liable for the Russian assets  even if a court were to rule in Russia’s favor in a hypothetical lawsuit. If the EU authorizes the reparations loan to Ukraine  Euroclear would essentially be complying with an EU regulation in turning over the funds to the EU.Euroclear’s defense would be straightforward: it was acting as a neutral intermediary executing an EU directive and does not actually have beneficial ownership of the assets. This would mean the liability would be kicked upstairs to Belgium and probably eventually to the EU.Although Russia could hardly expect to win a lawsuit in a Western jurisdiction  a point that an increasingly desperate EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas recently made at a contentious meeting in Strasbourg  that doesn't mean there is no risk.How could Russia challenge the expropriation in court?It is true that Russia can hardly expect to prevail in an EU or Western court. Many Russian claims have been quickly dismissed in the past. But given that Russia would clearly have a strong legal case  there are two potential negative scenarios for the EU.First of all  Russia or  more likely  Russia-affiliated entities would potentially find a legal hook to launch litigation to secure an injunction in neutral countries where Euroclear operates. If  for example  a court in a major jurisdiction (such as Hong Kong  Singapore  or Dubai) recognizes a claim by Russia or Russian‑related investors and issues an injunction against assets held by Euroclear (or its affiliates) in that jurisdiction  it could impede the transfer or usage of frozen assets. Such an outcome is  admittedly  not likely  but it does remain a risk for Euroclear and for the wider EU.Given that Euroclear is a key node in the global settlement and clearing infrastructure  any significant litigation risk or liability could impact its business  impose large contingent liabilities  and reduce the willingness of market participants to use it. Even if lawsuits don’t succeed  the fact that they are filed and can drag on for years creates legal uncertainty. That could raise the perceived “political risk” of holding assets via European custodians  feeding into a broader and more fundamental point about the credibility of EU institutions.Russia could therefore gain a strategic victory even if it doesn’t get its money back.Does the reparations loan actually give Ukraine leverage in peace talks?Although the Russian central bank still formally counts the frozen reserves as part of Russia’s overall reserves  in practice  the Finance Ministry does not treat the frozen portion of reserves as available when planning budgets or managing the National Wealth Fund (NWF). So  the government’s fiscal position and spending plans are based only on assets under Russian control – mainly yuan deposits  gold  and ruble securities – not just on the headline central bank reserves.Essentially  for the sake of the country’s fiscal affairs  Russia has de facto written these funds off. In that sense  the reparations loan plan provides absolutely no leverage against Russia.It has been argued  however  that Russia’s real interest is not necessarily in getting the funds back but in keeping them out of Ukraine’s hands. Indeed  Ukraine is facing a major funding shortage in the coming years  which can only either be filled by putting the onus on Western taxpayers – a politically fraught proposition – or by tapping the Russian funds.If there is any blow to Russia from this  it would come from Ukraine getting a get-out-of-jail free card to keep its finances afloat a while longer. However  there is no reason to believe that this would materially change the outcome of the conflict or in any way affect the calculus of the Russian leadership in how it goes about achieving its goals. Attempts to bring Russia to heel through economic leverage have up to this point failed miserably.Moreover  thanks to the sharp growth in the gold price in recent years  the value of Russia’s reserves has been rising dramatically. The official value of Russia’s central bank-held gold holdings reached $249 billion this summer. Russia also holds an undisclosed – and possibly sizeable – amount of gold in a second store known as the State Fund for Precious Metals and Stones (Gosfund)  a fund that has reportedly been augmented in recent years. Russia’s true gold holdings are thus believed to be substantial.How does the reparations loan make a grand peace deal more unlikely?The loan deal would give the West less room to maneuver to negotiate some sort of grand deal to end the Ukraine conflict because Russia could very well demand sanctions removal – while obviously not paying reparations to the Kiev regime – as part of a deal. However  such a scenario would leave the EU on the hook for a significant sum of money that was either supposed to be returned to it through reparations or written off because Ukraine would have no obligation to return the funds if it doesn’t receive reparations.For EU taxpayers  it could mean Brussels has walked them into a fait accompli where they simply have to stump up for funding a corrupt regime in Kiev  end of story.Since the likelihood of Russia suffering a clear-cut military defeat (and thus paying reparations) is acknowledged even in the West as being close to zero  what the EU is doing is dramatically raising the potential cost to itself if a deal is reached that entails Russia regaining access to its funds.If this loan or something similar to it does in fact go through  it can be seen as narrowing – whether by design or not – the range of possibilities available to the West in a potential settlement scenario. This point has been raised by Belgium throughout its several official protests against von der Leyen’s plan.The loan is also  implicitly  seen as an invitation to keep the war going – thus not only keeping the Kiev regime afloat but complicating the prospects for a comprehensive settlement.,negative,0.0,0.1,0.89,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['war', 'Russia', 'assets', 'things', 'EU', 'former French Finance Minister Bruno de Maire', 'Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Commission boss', '7.45 billion Swiss Francs', 'data protection laws', 'long-standing investment treaty', 'European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank', 'EU member states', 'Russian central-bank funds', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Russian reserves', 'house bank', 'fait accompli', 'corrupt regime', 'two choices', 'EC president', 'The US', 'ordinary circumstances', 'minus fees', 'interest-free loan', 'same value', 'budget expenses', 'past experience', 'offshore accounts', 'private institution', 'peace deal', 'sanctions relief', 'significant sum', 'convincing statements', 'significant pressure', 'different model', 'banking business', 'balance sheet', 'proprietary right', 'unsecured claim', 'hypothetical lawsuit', 'neutral intermediary', 'Russian assets', 'reparations loan', 'frozen assets', 'Belgian assets', 'bloc taxpayers', 'mid-duration bonds', 'unlikely event', 'EU countries', 'EU members', 'EU regulation', 'war chest', 'custodian business', 'Euroclear Moscow', 'client assets', 'reparations plan', 'Ukraine reparations', 'Brussels', 'Kiev', 'week', 'humiliation', 'plot', 'cash', 'coffers', 'repayment', 'road', 'look', 'talk', 'Reports', 'Luxembourg', 'country', 'Switzerland', 'G7', 'demands', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'principal', 'money', 'proceeds', 'collateral', 'insiders', 'sweetener', 'case', 'turn', 'liability', 'scheme', 'hook', 'things', 'arbitration', 'dispute', 'parties', 'litigation', 'somebody', 'lobbying', 'support', 'solutions', 'move', 'risks', 'deposits', 'liabilities', 'lends', 'safekeeping', 'something', 'court', 'favor', 'defense']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,rt.com

Belgium has vehemently protested the plan  demanding that other EU nations share responsibility for the move.Russia  meanwhile  has branded such ideas “theft” and warned of far-reaching legal and retaliatory steps if its reserves are stolen.In an interview with La Libre daily on Tuesday  De Wever acknowledged that the pressure surrounding the loan issue is “incredible ” adding that the political appeal of supporting “the good guy  Ukraine ” at Russia’s expense obscured unprecedented legal risks and would break historical precedent. “Even during World War II  Germany’s money wasn’t confiscated ” he said.“At the end of the war  the losing state must relinquish all or part of these assets to compensate the victors. But who really believes that Russia will lose in Ukraine? It’s a fable  a complete illusion.”According to De Wever  even despite the current tensions  “it’s not even desirable for them [Russia] to lose” due to likely instability and nuclear weapons risks spiraling out of control in this scenario.The Belgian leader further warned that Moscow would not “calmly accept” confiscation  pointing to the risk that Russia could seize Western-owned factories and some €16 billion ($18.6 billion) held by Euroclear in Russia. He added that Belarus or China could follow suit by targeting Western assets on their soil.De Wever also previously warned that the de facto seizing of the assets – the final decision on which is expected at a summit in Brussels on December 18 – would essentially derail the ongoing Ukraine peace process.

53994,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7n95wzl9lo,Belgium urges Europe to drop plan for frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine,"The foreign minister says the EU is downplaying its concerns and over the plan which Belgium sees as ""fundamentally wrong"".","Belgium urges Europe to drop plan for frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine1 day ago Share Save Nick Beake Europe correspondent Share SaveAFP Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has written to the European Commission chief warning that the EU's plan is ""fundamentally wrong""Belgium has accused the EU of ""downplaying"" its concerns over a plan to use frozen Russian assets held in Europe to support Ukraine. ""We keep on pleading for an alternative  namely the EU borrowing the amounts needed on the markets "" says Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot. The EU's proposal  which has been championed by the German Chancellor  Friedrich Merz  would see €140bn (£123bn) of Russian state assets held in Belgium transformed into a ""reparations loan"" to support Kyiv financially next year. The majority of EU countries support the plan and some have criticised the Belgians for blocking it. Belgium argues such a move would imperil a peace deal in the short term and risk legal action by Russia in the future. Russia has condemned the proposal and one of its top bankers has threatened the EU with 50 years of litigation if the idea becomes reality. The European Commission is set to put forward ways of resolving the impasse  but Maxime Prévot has complained the text being tabled on Wednesday does ""not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner"".EU countries have already used profits generated from around €210bn of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's ongoing defence following the full-scale invasion in February 2022. But using the assets themselves has proved far more controversial. EU leaders are set to vote on the reparations loan at a summit in Brussels later this month  but it is far from clear that an agreement will be reached. Belgium has been the most vocal critic of the scheme because most of the assets frozen by the EU - €185bn - are held at Euroclear  the Brussels-based central securities depositor. The Belgian government argues it would bear the brunt of any Russian legal action if future problems emerged from an EU loan to Ukraine funded with these assets. Maxime Prévot says the risks are clear: ""If Russia takes us to court it will have every chance of winning and we  Belgium  will not be able to repay those €200bn  because that represents the equivalent of an entire year of the federal budget."" ""It would mean bankruptcy for Belgium.""Anadolu via Getty Images Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot has warned that the legal risks could prove disastrous for BelgiumPrime Minister Bart De Wever has already written to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  complaining that the plan is ""fundamentally wrong"". And  in a seemingly co-ordinated move  the head of Euroclear  Valérie Urbain  has made a similar argument. De Wever  a Flemish nationalist  said fellow EU countries had to give Belgium a legally binding guarantee that the risk would be shared if the loan to Ukraine collapsed or if sanctions on Russia were to be lifted. That may be difficult as the European Central Bank has said it would not be able to act as a lender of last resort. The Belgian prime minister has proposed that the EU provides a €45bn loan to Ukraine for next year by using provisions that can tapped into as part of the 27 member states' existing shared budget.But Chancellor Merz of Germany believes that is not the best way forward. He has said the using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine is ""increasingly urgent"" and urged his fellow leaders to rally round the idea. ""Ukraine needs our support. Russian attacks are intensifying. Winter is approaching  or rather  we are already in winter. And in this regard  I hope that we can come to a joint solution within the European Union "" he added. EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas agrees. A reparations loan would strengthen Europe's position against Moscow  she argues  and would serve as an incentive for President Vladimir Putin to come to the peace table.Veerle Colaert  professor of financial law at KU Leuven University  told the BBC she believed Belgium was justified in its concerns. ""Euroclear has a contractual obligation to pay back the money to the Russian central bank on first demand. The only reason it's not doing it is the sanctions "" she said. ""If sanctions are lifted and at that moment Euroclear hasn't got the money because it's being lent to the EU  Belgium would have to step in  but the amount involved is simply too large. That's why Belgium wants legally binding  on-demand guarantees from the other member states to share the risk."" The prospect of foreign reserves held in Europe being tapped for other uses could seriously dent confidence in Europe's financial system  Ms Colaert added. She argued the better option would be to raise a loan for Kyiv on the markets. Of the two possible paths she said: ""In both cases Europe has to reimburse the money. The advantage of taking the money from Euroclear's frozen funds is that it's interest free but it is not risk free.""Russia has promised to retaliate if the European Union uses frozen Russian sovereign assets for a loan to Ukraine. One of its most prominent bankers  Andrei Kostin  said Moscow would unleash half a century of litigation  should the plan be agreed by the EU. Mr Kostin  who is president-chairman of Vneshtorbank (VTB) – one of the leading state-owned banks in Russia – said it was unacceptable that such funds be give to Ukraine. ""As for the seizure of our money  in the end  we can manage without it"" he said.

On November 27  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the confiscation of immobilized Russian assets would be considered as theft of property and undermine confidence in the eurozone.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251201/eu-states-unwilling-to-share-risks-of-using-russias-frozen-assets---belgian-minister-1123207425.htmlbelgiumrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleuropean commission's proposal  russian assets  belgian foreign minister maxime prevot",negative,0.0,0.13,0.86,negative,0.0,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['EU Commission', 'Russian Assets', 'Foreign Minister', 'Belgium', 'Proposal', 'NATO Foreign Affairs Ministerial meeting', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'europe russia european union', 'foreign currency reserves', 'The European Commission', 'frozen Russian assets', 'foreign assets', 'European accounts', 'Sputnik International', 'reparations loan', '140 billion euros', 'reparation loan', 'material damage', 'military operation', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'EU Commission', 'EU countries', 'same solidarity', 'economy belgium', 'belgium russia', 'ukraine assets', 'sputnikglobe', 'disagrees', 'commissions', 'russian-assets', 'foreign-minister', 'Proposal', 'Wednesday', 'cdn1.', 'option', 'reporters', 'use', 'return', 'November', 'media', 'amount', 'form', 'end', 'conflict', 'case', 'compensation', 'Moscow', 'start', 'G7', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'confiscation', 'property', 'confidence', 'eurozone', 'risks', 'russias-frozen-assets', 'belgian-minister', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,sputnikglobe.com

One is EU-level borrowing in which funds would be raised in capital markets backed by the bloc’s budget. This proposal requires unanimity  making it unlikely to pass.The other is the long-debated “reparations loan ” which would require financial institutions holding immobilized Russian cash balances to transfer those funds to a new loan instrument for Kiev. Under the mechanism  Ukraine would only be expected to repay the loan if and when Moscow pays reparations. This option only requires a qualified majority  making it more likely to pass.Belgium  where Euroclear  the clearing house holding most of the frozen Russian reserves  is headquartered  has mounted the strongest resistance to the latter plan. It has warned repeatedly that the scheme carries serious financial and legal risks and has demanded that EU partners share responsibility for any fallout.Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot has called the “reparations loan” the “worst of all” available options  accusing the European Commission of pushing ahead without addressing Belgium’s concerns. Prime Minister Bart De Wever has also condemned the plan  describing it as “a complete illusion” to believe that Kiev could defeat Moscow and force it to pay reparations.Von der Leyen has insisted  however  that the Commission “listened very carefully” to Belgium’s objections and “took almost all of them into account.”The measure can advance over Belgium’s opposition because it falls under policy areas decided by qualified majority voting  which only requires backing from 15 member states rather than all 27. This prevents any single government from vetoing the initiative.Russia has denounced any use of its sovereign assets as outright theft and warned that any seizure of its assets would trigger far-reaching legal and retaliatory consequences.,negative,0.0,0.1,0.89,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['new asset theft push', 'Von der Leyen', 'key EU member', 'concerns', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'frozen Russian money', 'next two years', 'Russian cash balances', 'frozen Russian reserves', 'two financing options', 'new loan instrument', 'central bank assets', 'qualified majority voting', 'new ‘reparations’ loan', 'available options', 'EU-level borrowing', 'capital markets', 'reparations loan', 'financial institutions', 'clearing house', 'strongest resistance', 'serious financial', 'legal risks', 'complete illusion', 'policy areas', '15 member states', 'single government', 'sovereign assets', 'outright theft', 'reaching legal', 'retaliatory consequences', 'European Commission', 'The Commission', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'EU partners', 'latter plan', 'scheme', 'Ukraine', 'objections', 'funds', 'statement', 'Wednesday', 'proposal', 'Kiev', 'bloc', 'budget', 'unanimity', 'mechanism', 'Moscow', 'responsibility', 'fallout', 'concerns', 'account', 'measure', 'opposition', 'backing', 'initiative', 'seizure']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,rt.com
53997,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rte.ie/news/ukraine/2025/1203/1547116-russian-assets/,EU plan for €210bn in frozen Russian assets to fund Kyiv,The European Commission has brought forward a legal proposal to potentially use up to €210 billion in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine in the coming years.,"The European Commission has brought forward a legal proposal to potentially use up to €210 billion in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine in the coming years.The plan would provide for an initial €90 billion  which would be covered either by using immobilised Russian assets or through EU borrowing on the international markets.The commission's preference  and that of most member states  is to convert frozen Russian assets into a loan for Ukraine that would be repaid only when Moscow started to make war reparations to Kyiv.The so-called Reparations Loan has been opposed by Belgium  which hosts Euroclear  a securities depository that holds the vast majority of the Russian assets.Under the proposal  the commission suggests using an emergency provision within the EU treaty to prevent the measure being blocked by Hungary.Russian assets were frozen within days of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.They have remained immobilised due to EU sanctions. Since those sanctions have to be rolled over every six months  there is a risk that Hungary or Slovakia - both friendly to Russia - could veto their rollover  thus putting the loan to Ukraine at risk.Under the proposal  the EU would invoke Article 122 of the EU treaties  essentially removing the veto on the basis that huge liabilities in having to repay the Russian assets would inflict economic harm on the EU.That would mean the assets remaining under sanction via a weighted majority vote  rather than the normal unanimity procedure  thus depriving Hungary of its veto.Ursula von der Leyen said she had informed the US Treasury Secretary that the EU would pursue such a course of actionThe other proposal - to fund Ukraine through borrowing on the international markets - would require unanimity  and would therefore most likely be blocked by Hungary.""We are proposing to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next two years "" said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.""That’s €90 billion. The remainder would be for international partners to cover.""Since pressure is the only language the Kremlin responds to  we can also dial it up "" she said. ""We have to increase the costs of war for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's aggression and today's proposal gives us the means to do this.""The legal text will now be subject to negotiations between the commission and EU member states.In October  EU leaders committed to meeting Ukraine’s financial and military needs for the next two years.Ukraine is expected to run out of cash next April as Russia continues its onslaught.The Commission President said the proposal had taken into account almost all the concerns raised by Belgium. The proposal would now also cover other financial institutions in the EU that hold such assets  von der Leyen said.President von der Leyen said she had informed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the EU would pursue such a course of action  saying the proposal was ""positively received"".Hours before the commission set out its legal proposals  Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said they fell short of Belgium's requirements.""We have the frustrating feeling of not having been heard. Our concerns are being downplayed "" Ms Prevot told reporters at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.""The texts the Commission will table today do not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner.""Belgium has demanded that other EU countries guarantee to cover all legal costs arising from Russian lawsuits against the scheme.It also wants them to guarantee they would help provide money quickly to pay Russia back if a court ever ruled Moscow must be refunded.Additional reporting by Reuters",neutral,0.0,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.05,0.21,0.74,True,English,"['EU plan', 'Russian assets', 'Kyiv', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent', 'President von der Leyen', 'NATO foreign ministers', 'Russian President Vladimir', 'The Commission President', 'most member states', 'next two years', 'weighted majority vote', 'The European Commission', 'normal unanimity procedure', 'EU member states', 'other financial institutions', 'other EU countries', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Ms Prevot', 'coming years', 'vast majority', 'Russian lawsuits', 'international markets', 'securities depository', 'emergency provision', 'six months', 'huge liabilities', 'economic harm', 'financing needs', 'international partners', 'legal text', 'military needs', 'legal proposals', 'frustrating feeling', 'satisfactory manner', 'Additional reporting', 'other proposal', 'EU treaty', 'EU treaties', 'EU leaders', 'war reparations', 'legal costs', 'Reparations Loan', 'EU borrowing', 'EU sanctions', 'Ukraine', 'plan', 'initial €', 'preference', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'measure', 'Hungary', 'days', 'invasion', 'February', 'risk', 'Slovakia', 'rollover', 'Article', 'veto', 'basis', 'course', 'action', 'two-thirds', 'remainder', 'pressure', 'language', 'Kremlin', 'Putin', 'aggression', 'means', 'negotiations', 'October', 'cash', 'onslaught', 'account', 'concerns', 'requirements', 'reporters', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'texts', 'scheme', 'money', 'court', 'Reuters']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,rte.ie

We are with them for the long haul "" said von der Leyen while rolling out the proposal which would use Russian money as collateral to fund Ukraine’s economy and war effort through a “reparations loan.”Von der Leyen said that using the frozen assets would strengthen the Ukrainian position at peace negotiations with Russia and the U.S. but it would also send a message to Moscow that “the prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them.” She said that she had informed the Trump administration about the proposal.EU leaders have committed to fund Ukraine over the next two years  whatever the method. The EU has already poured in over 170 billion euros ($197 billion) since the war started in 2022.Von der Leyen said that if the loan plan didn't pass muster  the bloc could borrow the money on international markets in a scheme underpinned by its long-term budget. The problem here  though  is that it would require the approval of all 27 member countries  and Hungary has consistently blocked aid to Ukraine.The biggest pot of ready funds available is through frozen Russian assets. Most of the money is held in Belgium – around 194 billion euros as of June – and outside the EU in Japan  with around $50 billion  and the U.S.  U.K. and Canada with lesser amounts. A total of 210 billion euros worth ($245 billion) are held in Europe.To address Belgian concerns  the commission's complex proposal includes safeguards to protect EU nations from “possible retaliation from Russia "" a prohibition of any release of the frozen assets  and a way to borrow money as the EU to ""underpin a loan to Ukraine.”But Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that his country considers “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky. It has never been done before.” Russia has described the scheme as “theft.”Haltingly reading prepared remarks to reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels  Prévot urged the EU to borrow the money for Ukraine on international markets. “It is a well-known  a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters ” he said.“The reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks ” he said  adding that the commission’s proposals do not address Belgium’s concerns. “It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks.”Belgium fears that the Brussels-based financial clearing house holding the frozen assets  Euroclear  could take legal action if Russia challenges any use of the funds or if the move harms its image and business interests.Prévot said Belgium feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return ” he said.In essence  the 90 billion euros would not be seized from Russia as such  as Kyiv would refund it once Moscow pays significant reparations for the massive destruction its war has caused. Should Moscow refuse  the assets would remain frozen.“We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns  and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal ” Von der Leyen said. “We will share the burden in a fair way  as it is the European way.”Other EU partners insist that they too understand Belgium's worries.“We take Belgium’s concerns seriously ” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters. “They are justified  but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”His Dutch counterpart David van Weel underlined that “these funds are really  really important.

Several EU countries have already agreed to provide financial guarantees should things go wrong.Belgium has been earning some tax income on the assets  and the interest raised is also being used to fund a loan program for Ukraine organized by the Group of Seven major world powers.The European Central Bank is worried that the plan for an EU reparation loan could undermine confidence in the euro single currency on international markets.

An estimated €51.6 billion ($59.9 billion) will go directly to military needs. The estimate is based on the fal…,According to Ursula von der Leyen’s options paper provided to member states on October 23  Ukraine will need €71.7 billion ($83.2 billion) in 2026. An estimated €51.6 billion ($59.9 billion) will go directly to military needs. The estimate is based on the false assumption that the war will end next year. The price tag for funding Ukraine through 2027 is €135.7 billion on the low end.The majority will be funneled through the EU’s Ukraine Facility mechanism. “It will now be key to rapidly reach a clear commitment on how to ensure that the necessary funding for Ukraine will be agreed at the next European Council meeting in December ” the European Commission President wrote to the 27 member states. “Clearly  there are no easy options.”Ursula is not prepared to accept the peace plan. There IS AN OPTION to end this war  but the neocons are currently refusing to surrender. Trump must use America’s NATO status as leverage—end the war or the US will pull out.“Europe cannot afford paralysis  either by hesitation or by the search for perfect or simple solutions which do not exist ” she stated  ignorant to the fact that Europe’s paralysis has been caused by the EU’s direct actions.Part of this funding will pay for Ukraine’s government expenses. The EU has Ukraine’s entire government on its payroll. Around €52.3 billion will “stabilize the economy” over the next two years. Forget the fact that the EU has banished tariffs and demoted their own member states on trade.Brussels is providing three options for indefinite funding.The first option is voluntary bilateral contributions. Funding by member states would be considered a non-repayable grant incorporated into each nation’s budget. Ursula said that payments must amount to “at least” €90 billion by 2027  again assuming that all of this will end in 2026.The EU is offering a second option that states member states will simply carry joint debt in legally binding  irrevocable guarantees to borrow. Brussels claims that a nation could opt-out but that would result in other members increasing their contributions. It is highly unlikely that the union would allow this to happen without severe punishments. The interest payment promise is laughable since Ukraine could never repay  and Russia will certainly not be footing the bill.Brussels sees nations like Belgium and Hungary as a threat to its centralized power. Von der Leyen suggested removing the unanimity rule in order to impose sanctions on Russia without a consensus. She also recommended that Belgium withdraw from its 36-year bilateral investment treaty with Russia.The third option is a reparations loan that would use frozen Russian assets. Central securities depository Euroclear currently holds 185 billion euros from the Russian Central Bank  and an additional 25 billion euros is held in commercial banks across the EU. This option is a violation of international law. “As this option would be a financially and legally innovative solution  it cannot be discounted that there are potential knock-on effects  including for financial markets ” von der Leyen admitted. “A concerted effort by the Union  and possibly international partners  to counteract such perception (of confiscation) would need to be made.”Moscow has been patient but firm on recovering its frozen assets. The EU has already pledged a portion of those assets to Ukraine  meaning it no longer exists. Certain members are pledging billions before an agreement has been made while others would like to preserve their sovereignty.

Photograph: Maxym Marusenko/EPAThe easy choices are long exhausted. Ukraine is set to run tight on money in the next few months and unless European allies or others step up  it could find itself in serious difficulty holding off Russia’s advances on the battlefield.Instead of turning to their own national budgets  EU states will look to tap a pile of Russian cash worth more than €200 billion  which has been frozen in Europe since the start of the war more than four years ago.Speaking on Wednesday  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Ukraine stands at a “critical juncture”.Should peace talks between US and Russian officials run into another dead end  Ukraine will need a huge injection of funding to keep running basic services and financing its armed forces.EU leaders will have to decide how to help fill that gap at a crucial Brussels summit on December 18th.After weeks of negotiations and back-room planning  von der Leyen’s powerful EU executive formally proposed two options.One was to borrow money for Ukraine on the markets as an EU bloc. The other was to use frozen Russian central bank assets to finance a €90 billion loan.The first option  joint EU borrowing  has traditionally been opposed by Germany  the Netherlands and others.The second option  a so-called reparations loan  while politically and legally complex  is the choice the commission will be pushing.Belgium’s prime minister Bart de Wever has so far refused to budge in his opposition to the idea.The vast majority of those Russian assets were held in Euroclear  a depository for state bonds in Belgium. His government is concerned about legal consequences and possible retribution from Moscow.De Wever  a hard-right Flemish nationalist  is less amenable to compromise for the wider European good than his predecessor  the liberal Alexander De Croo.“We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns and we have taken almost all of them into account ... We have very strong safeguards in place to protect member states and reduce the risks as much as possible ” von der Leyen said this week.The reparations loan would only need the support of a weighted majority of the 27 leaders to be approved. But in political terms  it might be difficult for other European leaders to ignore the opposition of Belgium.The language laid out in the legal text tabled by the commission is stark: “Without this loan  it can be anticipated  in the current international context  that Ukraine will by April 2026 not be able to support its fiscal needs  entailing a realistic risk of defeat in a rather short term”.The loan would be repaid if Russia agreed to pay compensation for the destruction caused by its invasion of Ukraine.One big problem has been the fact the assets only remain frozen as long as economic sanctions on Russia stay in place. Introduced in the weeks after the 2022 invasion  the sanctions need to be renewed every six months  by unanimous agreement of all 27 states.Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orban and Slovakia’s populist leader Robert Fico  an opponent and sceptic of EU support to Ukraine in turn  have on several occasions threatened to veto the rollover  before backing down.Locking in the sanctioned frozen assets is key to the loan getting off the ground. Failing to do so would leave national governments having to cover the cost themselves  should repayment to Russia be triggered early by Orban or someone else.The commission plans to get around those veto risks by relying on emergency EU powers to prohibit the assets being returned to Russia  claiming such a decision would endanger the stability of the union’s economy.One senior EU official said this would “eliminate” the risk one rogue leader could collapse the sanctions regime freezing the Russian state assets.EU states will still have to provide guarantees of €105 billion for the loan  in case there is a scenario where repayment to Russia is ever triggered without compensation being provided.The other funding option – borrowing as a bloc – would need unanimous sign-off  meaning the opposition of Orban  Fico  De Wever or another leader could scupper that plan. That makes it unlikely to be pursued.To complicate things further  the Trump administration has its eyes on the frozen assets as a key bargaining chip to throw back to Russian president Vladimir Putin in a peace deal.Their recent 28-point plan referenced using the assets trapped in Europe to partly fund US-led ventures rebuilding Ukraine  which the US would profit from.The formal proposals tabled by the commission will kick off a hectic fortnight of negotiations between national diplomats and officials  before the EU’s 27 leaders sit down together on December 18th. Everyone will be watching for any shift in Belgium’s position.The summit has the potential to run on for two or three days  or as long as it takes to come out with a decision.Taoiseach Micheál Martin and the other national leaders might be well advised to get some of their Christmas shopping done early this year.,neutral,0.07,0.86,0.08,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'big choice', 'vital aid', 'Ukraine', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'liberal Alexander De Croo', 'Russian president Vladimir Putin', 'One senior EU official', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'populist leader Robert Fico', 'Russian central bank assets', 'One big problem', 'nine-storey residential building', 'hard-right Flemish nationalist', 'current international context', 'one rogue leader', 'key bargaining chip', 'wider European good', 'powerful EU executive', 'joint EU borrowing', 'emergency EU powers', 'Bart de Wever', 'crucial Brussels summit', 'recent 28-point plan', 'European Commission president', 'other European leaders', 'other funding option', 'Russian state assets', 'European allies', 'Russian strike', 'Russian cash', 'Russian assets', 'state bonds', 'first option', 'second option', 'Russian officials', 'EU states', 'EU leaders', 'Kyiv region', 'Maxym Marusenko', 'easy choices', 'serious difficulty', 'national budgets', 'critical juncture', 'peace talks', 'dead end', 'huge injection', 'basic services', 'armed forces', 'December 18th', 'back-room planning', 'vast majority', 'legal consequences', 'possible retribution', 'strong safeguards', 'weighted majority', 'political terms', 'legal text', 'fiscal needs', 'short term', 'unanimous agreement', 'several occasions', 'national governments', 'unanimous sign-off', 'Trump administration', 'peace deal', 'US-led ventures', 'formal proposals', 'hectic fortnight', 'national diplomats', 'three days', 'EU bloc', 'EU support', 'frozen assets', 'member states', 'two options', 'realistic risk', 'veto risks', '€90 billion loan', 'reparations loan', 'economic sanctions', '27 leaders', '27 states', 'excavator', 'debris', 'city', 'Vyshhorod', 'Ukraine', 'Sunday', 'Photograph', 'money', 'next', 'months', 'others', 'advances', 'battlefield', 'pile', 'start', 'war', 'Wednesday', 'gap', 'weeks', 'negotiations', 'markets', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'Belgium', 'opposition', 'idea', 'Euroclear', 'depository', 'Moscow', 'predecessor', 'concerns', 'account', 'place', 'language', 'April', 'defeat', 'compensation', 'destruction', 'invasion', 'fact', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'opponent', 'sceptic', 'turn', 'rollover', 'ground', 'cost', 'repayment', 'someone', 'decision', 'stability', 'union', 'economy', 'guarantees', 'case', 'scenario', 'things', 'eyes', 'Everyone', 'shift', 'potential']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,irishtimes.com

Solvable if we stand together and are willing to take responsibility.”,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'Belgium', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul', 'EU economy chief Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'Copyright AFP Jack GUEZ', 'looming budget black holes', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Most other EU states', 'The European Union', 'punishing invasion drags', 'multiple member states', 'next two years', 'international deposit organisation', 'other EU countries', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgian government', 'United States', 'two people', 'Russian attack', 'international partners', 'EU borrowing', 'EU leaders', 'Max DELANY', '90 billion euros', 'outspoken opposition', 'key player', 'fourth year', 'legal proposal', 'peace negotiations', 'December 18 summit', 'vast bulk', 'crippling legal', 'financial retribution', 'legal texts', 'satisfactory manner', 'Three-tier defence', 'solid guarantees', 'legal jeopardy', '25 billion euros', 'initial size', 'original 140-billion-euro', '210 billion euros', 'complex scheme', 'strong resistance', 'weighted majority', 'reparations loan', 'financing needs', 'Ukraine', 'Wednesday', 'plan', 'Belgium', 'executive', 'options', 'Kyiv', 'two-thirds', 'journalists', 'remainder', 'money', 'bloc', 'strength', 'war', 'officials', 'agreement', 'Euroclear', 'fears', 'concerns', 'alternative', 'amounts', 'markets', 'liability', 'place', 'rest', 'destruction', 'push', 'initiative', 'unanimity', 'solution', 'issue', 'responsibility']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,digitaljournal.com

(AP Photo/Harry Nakos)BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Wednesday revealed details of its plan to use billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's needs over the next two years  but Belgium rejected the scheme and insisted that it poses major financial and legal risks.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financial and military needs for 2026 and 2027  which the International Monetary Fund puts at 137 billion euros ($160 billion)  by providing 90 billion euros ($105 billion).She said that other international partners would be called on to cover the remaining third.""Today we are sending a very strong message to the Ukrainian people. We are with them for the long haul "" said von der Leyen while rolling out the proposal which would use Russian money as collateral to fund Ukraine’s economy and war effort through a “reparations loan.”Von der Leyen said that using the frozen assets would strengthen the Ukrainian position at peace negotiations with Russia and the U.S. but it would also send a message to Moscow that “the prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them.” She said that she had informed the Trump administration about the proposal.EU leaders have committed to fund Ukraine over the next two years  whatever the method. The EU has already poured in over 170 billion euros ($197 billion) since the war started in 2022.Von der Leyen said that if the loan plan didn't pass muster  the bloc could borrow the money on international markets in a scheme underpinned by its long-term budget. The problem here  though  is that it would require the approval of all 27 member countries  and Hungary has consistently blocked aid to Ukraine.The biggest pot of ready funds available is through frozen Russian assets. Most of the money is held in Belgium – around 194 billion euros as of June – and outside the EU in Japan  with around $50 billion  and the U.S.  U.K. and Canada with lesser amounts. A total of 210 billion euros worth ($245 billion) are held in Europe.To address Belgian concerns  the commission's complex proposal includes safeguards to protect EU nations from “possible retaliation from Russia "" a prohibition of any release of the frozen assets  and a way to borrow money as the EU to ""underpin a loan to Ukraine.”But Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that his country considers “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky. It has never been done before.” Russia has described the scheme as “theft.”Haltingly reading prepared remarks to reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels  Prévot urged the EU to borrow the money for Ukraine on international markets. “It is a well-known  a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters ” he said.“The reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks ” he said  adding that the commission’s proposals do not address Belgium’s concerns. “It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks.”Belgium fears that the Brussels-based financial clearing house holding the frozen assets  Euroclear  could take legal action if Russia challenges any use of the funds or if the move harms its image and business interests.Prévot said Belgium feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return ” he said.In essence  the 90 billion euros would not be seized from Russia as such  as Kyiv would refund it once Moscow pays significant reparations for the massive destruction its war has caused. Should Moscow refuse  the assets would remain frozen.“We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns  and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal ” Von der Leyen said. “We will share the burden in a fair way  as it is the European way.”Other EU partners insist that they too understand Belgium's worries.“We take Belgium’s concerns seriously ” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters. “They are justified  but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”His Dutch counterpart David van Weel underlined that “these funds are really  really important. We need to support the Ukrainian economy  otherwise they will have a very tough time next year.”“We understand the Belgian concerns  and we are willing to at least make sure that they are not alone in this ” he said. Several EU countries have already agreed to provide financial guarantees should things go wrong.Belgium has been earning some tax income on the assets  and the interest raised is also being used to fund a loan program for Ukraine organized by the Group of Seven major world powers.The European Central Bank is worried that the plan for an EU reparation loan could undermine confidence in the euro single currency on international markets.

Ukraine’s “war fund” is expected to be exhausted in April.The proposal will serve as a basis for direct technical negotiations before the planned meeting of EU leaders in mid-December to make decisions on the most sensitive aspects of the initiative. Ukraine would have to repay the loan only if Russia ends the conflict and pays war reparations  which is considered a highly unlikely scenario.Of the reparations loan  115 billion euros is earmarked to finance Ukraine’s defense industry  while 50 billion euros will cover Kiev’s budgetary needs. The remaining 45 billion euros of the package will be used to repay a loan from the G7 group to Ukraine from 2024.The main obstacle remains the Belgian government’s opposition to the loan. “The text that the commission will present today does not satisfactorily address our concerns ” Belgian Foreign Minister Maxim Prevost told reporters Wednesday morning on the sidelines of a NATO meeting. “We have the disappointing feeling that our views have not been heard.”With today's proposals  we can give Ukrainians the means to defend themselves.

According to a 2025 report by Grand View Research [1]  the U.S. baby pants segment is expected to grow nearly 8 percent year over year  driven by convenience for active toddlers  time-saving benefits for busy parents  and premium features such as 360° stretchable waistbands and hypoallergenic materials.This growth reflects a broader shift in consumer behavior. U.S. shoppers are increasingly choosing store-brand products that deliver premium performance without the premium price tag. NIQ Omnisales+ data shows that private label sales grew 4.1 percent year-over-year across the U.S. market  reflecting a rise in consumer trust and loyalty in retailer brands [2]. Ontex  a long-time leader in private label innovation across Europe—where consumers have long embraced store brands as a first choice for quality and innovation—brings its decades of expertise to help North American retailers meet evolving consumer expectations.“The expansion of our baby pants capabilities across North America highlights our commitment to supporting major retailers as they respond to one of the category’s fastest-growing segments ” said Paul Wood  Ontex North America president. “As consumers prioritize both performance and value  Ontex is helping retailers deliver products that meet families’ needs  without compromise. This growth reinforces our confidence in the future of private label in the U.S. market.”A global leader in personal care product manufacturing  Ontex partners with major retailers worldwide to deliver products consumers can trust. Its North American operations in Stokesdale  North Carolina  and Tijuana  Mexico  reflect ongoing commitment to production tailored to the U.S. market  customer-driven innovation and supply chain resiliency  ensuring families have access to affordable and reliable high-quality products.Visit the Ontex North America website or contact northamericasales@ontexglobal.com for more information.***Images can be found here: https://ontex.com/news/all-news/media-download-center/ ‎Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.74,0.23,0.03,True,English,"['North American Baby Pants Capabilities', 'Rising Demand', 'Ontex', 'U.S. baby pants segment', 'personal care product manufacturing', 'Tripled baby pants capacity', 'growing baby pants segment', 'North American manufacturing capabilities', 'Ontex North America president', 'Ontex North America website', 'baby pants capabilities', 'personal care solutions', 'U.S. shoppers', 'U.S. market', 'bi-coastal manufacturing model', 'North American operations', 'leading international developer', 'two critical advantages', 'Grand View Research', 'NIQ Omnisales+ data', 'premium price tag', 'private label sales', 'evolving consumer expectations', 'North American retailers', 'Ontex Group NV', 'reliable high-quality products', 'supply chain resiliency', 'private label innovation', 'growing segment', 'North Carolina', 'production capacity', 'premium features', 'consumer demand', 'consumer behavior', 'consumer trust', 'United States', 'operational efficiencies', 'US retailers', 'optimal cost', 'active toddlers', 'time-saving benefits', 'busy parents', '360° stretchable waistbands', 'hypoallergenic materials', 'broader shift', 'retailer brands', 'time leader', 'store brands', 'first choice', 'major retailers', 'Paul Wood', 'global leader', 'customer-driven innovation', 'premium performance', 'store-brand products', 'strategic expansion', 'families’ needs', 'ongoing commitment', 'serve', 'surety', 'Atlanta', 'EURONEXT', 'assured', 'affordability', 'reliability', '2025 report', 'year', 'convenience', 'growth', 'rise', 'loyalty', 'long', 'Europe', 'consumers', 'decades', 'expertise', 'category', 'value', 'compromise', 'confidence', 'future', 'Stokesdale', 'Tijuana', 'Mexico', 'access', 'affordable', 'northamericasales', 'ontexglobal', 'information', 'Images', 'news', 'download', 'Attachment']",2025-12-03,2025-12-04,globenewswire.com

Technical analysis shows improving short-term momentum for ENA. USDe supply contraction  however  poses risks to Ethena’s ecosystem. Ethena (ENA) continues to draw market interest…,Ethena (ENA) price rises as 21Shares launches Ethena and Morpho ETPs in Europe.Technical analysis shows improving short-term momentum for ENA.USDe supply contraction  however  poses risks to Ethena’s ecosystem.Ethena (ENA) continues to draw market interest as the crypto landscape shifts around new institutional products and changing stablecoin dynamics.At press time  ENA had surged by about 15.96% in a day to trade near the $0.28 zone  outpacing the broader market’s 6.03% gain.Notably  the price surge follows the launch of the 21shares Ethena ETP (EENA) and the 21shares Morpho ETP (MORPH)  both of which are now listed on major European exchanges such as SIX Swiss Exchange and Euronext.These listings offer regulated access to Ethena (ENA) and Morpho  expanding the potential investor base at a time when demand for transparent  exchange-traded crypto exposure continues to grow.ETP listings fuel institutional interestThe introduction of the Ethena ETP and Morpho ETP marks a significant step for the ecosystem.With support for both USD and EUR trading  the products lower barriers for European investors seeking exposure to ENA through familiar financial structures.Similar ETP launches for other altcoins in the past have triggered waves of institutional inflows  and early signs point to rising attention toward Ethena as well.Analysts see the move as a sign that Ethena’s infrastructure is maturing  particularly as 21Shares adds the token to its lineup of regulated crypto products.Market participants are now watching ETP trading volumes to determine how strongly institutional buying may support ENA’s next leg.Stablecoin contraction tempers enthusiasmDespite the strong price action  Ethena faces challenges linked to its synthetic stablecoin  USDe.The token has seen a sharp 24% supply contraction in November  with market cap dropping from $9.3 billion to $7.1 billion.Much of the decline followed a brief depeg event in October  which prompted over $2 billion in redemptions even though the incident was attributed to a Binance oracle issue rather than a flaw in the protocol.Competition from fiat-backed stablecoins intensified during the same period  with USDT  USDC  PYUSD  and RLUSD collectively adding billions in inflows  widening their dominance within the $311 billion stablecoin market.And since USDe plays a central role in Ethena’s revenue-generating model  reduced supply and activity may weigh on long-term protocol fees  making it an important factor for ENA holders to monitor.Ethena price forecastThe technical picture has turned more constructive over the past week.ENA has broken above its 7-day simple moving average around $0.272  where momentum picked up following a bullish MACD crossover.The RSI has also recovered from recent weakness  suggesting sellers have lost control in the short term.Traders should  however  watch closely to see if ENA can close convincingly above $0.30  which aligns with a key Fibonacci retracement level.A break above $0.30 could open the door toward $0.51 in the near term  according to CoinLore  although the token remains far below its all-time high  and the 200-day EMA near $0.47  which stands as a formidable resistance zone.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['ENA price prediction', 'new Ethena', 'Morpho

The agreement ensures that THEON will be able to serve the projected increasing demand for Night Vision systems across Europe but also in the MENA and APAC region in the coming years. THEON will exercise its option for 2027 and 2028 into firm orders before the end of the year  ensuring an even greater  proportionally  absorption of EXOSENS’ recently announced capacity increase starting in 2027  giving it further competitive advantage.The global availability of IITs is expected to remain at a delicate balance  with global supply over the coming years falling materially short of demand  despite the recently announced capacity increases by both Exosens and Harder Digital  in which THEON owns a 60% controlling stake. Such capacity increases were driven by Theon’s increasing order intake  and prospects input  including over the last few months. THEON will provide updated details of its total order intake following the official signing of a sizable OCCAR Contract Revision on December 10  2025 (after market close)  with this revision expected to materially increase THEON’s backlog.Following THEON’s recent acquisition of 9.8% of EXOSENS  making it the company’s largest strategic investor  this extended agreement strengthens production and delivery schedules coordination between the two companies  supporting delivery of each other’s medium-term growth ambitions and increased collaboration between the two companies.Overall  THEON expects to procure well over 400 000 tubes in the next five years through this supply agreement  reinforcing its leading position in the global Night Vision market and enabling it to rapidly respond to customers’ demands.Christian Hadjiminas CEO of THEON commented: ""Extending our partnership with Exosens until 2030 is a strategic milestone for THEON and Exosens. This further solidified partnership for IIT supply will ensure THEON can meet accelerating global demand for Night Vision in the years ahead. By working to support expanded capability with both Exosens and Harder Digital  and locking in higher proportional volumes  we are ensuring that THEON remains at the forefront to respond to global demand trends. THEON’s anticipation to continue growing faster than the market in Night Vision and the shift to longer term and frame agreements by our customers and end users  underscore the importance of our increased collaboration with Exosens  including through the recently announced strategic stake.”For inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

AMSTERDAM  Dec. ...,"Heineken 0.0 Zero JudgementA Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on this link.AMSTERDAM  Dec. 03  2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The World has finally called time on ‘drinking pressure’ as society moves to a place where the uncomfortable question of ‘’why aren’t you drinking?’’ is officially more awkward to ask than answer.A new global study* from Heineken® 0.0  the World’s number 1† non-alcoholic beer  reveals that 2025 marks the first festive season where saying “no thanks” needs no excuse  with almost three-quarters (72%) of people confident to skip alcohol without fear of being judged or excluded.Attitudes towards drinking alcohol are changing fast. The study  carried out in five countries* in partnership with renowned author of Sober Curious  Ruby Warrington  reveals over two-thirds (67%) of people now say it’s outdated and inappropriate to ask why someone isn't drinking alcohol in 2025. Also  81% agree it’s acceptable to say “no” to alcohol at festive events – no explanation required.A Global Surge in ConfidenceBack in January  Heineken®’s ‘0.0 Reasons Needed’ study showed Gen Z were leading a quietly confident movement  but some social stigma around not drinking alcohol still existed. Fast forward less than a year  and that confidence is taking hold in cultures from all over the World  with two-thirds of us (66%) finding it very easy to turn down a drink at festive events  such as work parties.Heineken®’s partner in its original January study  Charles Spence  Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford  said  “These two studies show how quickly attitudes shift. Alcohol has been central to social life for generations  but the data now prove moderation is for everyone.”How people plan to celebrate this season also tells the story. 37% will moderate their intake  27% plan to abstain altogether  and 1 in 5 will raise a 0.0 beer instead. Gen Z are leading the charge for balance with 30% planning to ‘zebra stripe’ their drinks  alternating between alcoholic and non-alcoholic all night.Social Pressure? Off the MenuThe big reason behind the global shift? Fear of missing out has finally gone out of fashion. Nearly 9 in 10 (86%) say they are comfortable drinking low or no-alcohol options at festive events  and 76% say they don’t need alcohol to feel included. In fact  90% say they’d support a friend choosing to drink low or no-alcohol versions this festive season – proof that social pressure has given way to social acceptance.While the UK and US may be leading the charge  this shift is global. In Brazil  two-thirds (67%) say they’re comfortable choosing 0.0 in social settings. In Japan  once among the most alcohol-centric cultures  over four in ten (44%) now feel comfortable going alcohol-free at parties.Ruby Warrington  author and moderation expert  said: “The question “why aren’t you drinking?”” belongs firmly in the past. People everywhere now feel free to choose if and when they drink alcohol without fearing social pressure or awkwardness. When I coined the term ‘sober curious’ nearly ten years ago  the goal was to normalise the choice not to drink – and we’re finally here.”From Excuses to HumourFor years  turning down alcohol amid the festivities felt like it needed justification – so much so that nearly half (46%) of us typically associate the holiday period with drinking alcohol.Now  the excuses are turning from defensive to downright hilarious – reflecting the irrelevance of the question. Gen Z are laughing off the questions with wild one-liners like “I’m on a secret government mission” and “I promised my cat we’d do yoga together”  turning pressure into playfulness.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand  said: “As a champion of social life  Heineken® is always trying to better understand the ‘social glue’ that creates those shared moments we treasure. The research confirms what we always knew: Reaching for a Heineken® 0.0 doesn’t represent omission  it represents option.”Heineken® continues to champion moderation through its 0.0 campaigns  including When You Drive  Never Drink and its global sponsorship of Formula 1®. Because great nights out don’t need reasons  just good company.* The research was conducted by Censuswide  among a sample of 10 001 adults aged 18+ in the UK  USA  Spain  Japan and Brazil. The data was collected between 03.10.2025 - 09.10.2025. Censuswide abides by and employs members of the Market Research Society and follows the MRS code of conduct and ESOMAR principles.

Representing a new benchmark for branded residential living in Bali  the residences offer architectural distinction  complete privacy  and seamless access to the legendary Raffles service experience.Raffles Residences BaliSituated on a dramatic forested headland with sweeping views of the Indian Ocean and Bali's most sacred mountains  the development is accessed via a discreet private road and planned at exceptionally low density. Each branded residence is positioned for privacy yet remains moments from Raffles Bali's award-winning facilities — an offering reserved for a small number of buyers who value craftsmanship  exclusivity  and a freestanding residence in one of Bali's most protected enclaves.Developed by PT Jimbaran Greenhill — led by Kajima Development Pte Ltd in partnership with PT Jimbaran Hijau — the residences will be managed by Raffles Hotels & Resorts.

Branded residences offer peace of mind  professional maintenance  and strong resale value — a combination that has accelerated demand on the island's most exclusive coastlines.The new residences augment Accor's leadership positioning in the branded residences sector  with more than 50 branded residence communities now in operation across 25+ distinct hospitality brands globally  and further strengthen the Group's regional luxury pipeline  adding a flagship project in one of Asia's highest-demand leisure markets. Raffles Residences Bali will become a showcase for the group's branded residential expansion strategy across gateway cities and iconic resort destinations.A Design Approach Guided by Land  Light  and PrecisionA master plan  conceived by James Hyatt Studio (USA) harmonises the remarkable natural terrain with expansive ocean views. Here  topography is defined by Jimbaran Bay to the north and a lush valley to the west  bringing the characteristics of the sea and mountains together.By respecting existing contours  mature trees  and embracing the natural light  careful planning creates a secluded residential enclave in close harmony with nature. Where each residence is thoughtfully positioned to respond to the unique character of its setting while maximising dramatic ocean views.The design of the residences  led by Kajima together with Singapore and Bali-based Area Designs  features open yet intimate spaces with quiet emphasis on restraint and graceful proportions.Refined natural materials including locally sourced Palimanan limestone and Sukabumi green slate  Indonesian hardwoods such as teak and ironwood  and custom textiles reference Bali and Indonesian cultural vernaculars in a fresh  yet timeless way.Natural light and prevailing breezes are thoughtfully embraced  while careful consideration of privacy between the residences ensures comfort and seclusion. Provisions include living and dining spaces expanding seamlessly from indoors to outdoors  15m – 20m long infinity-edge swimming pools  and large outdoor areas together with shaded pavilions that are featured on the view side of the residences. Landscaping is richly layered yet well controlled through each compound with a carefully selected range of local flora.The legacy of the late Dr. Shoichi Kajima — who designed and owned his residence at The Batujimbar  a landmark estate for tropical modernism — quietly flows throughout every element of the design. The overall effect  achieved only through a rigorous design process  ensures the architecture has a timeless quality that exudes sophistication and a feeling of being deeply rooted in place.""With Raffles Residences Bali  we sought to create something that could only exist on this site — a site that carries the rare topographical condition of the ocean and mountain coexisting  echoing the character of Jimbaran and Ubud. The special connection between the ocean and the mountain is deeply valued in traditional Balinese cosmology and it was here that Dr. Kajima identified as a special place to witness the sunset  just as his Sanur villa was ideal to experience sunrise. When these residences are complete so will the vision to experience the best of Bali's wonders from dawn to dusk.""— Shuichi Oishi  CEO  Kajima Development Pte LtdInteriors Defined by 'Quiet Luxury'Interior design by HBA Resort (Bali)  AEDI Design Bureau  and BLINK Design Group emphasises light  volume  and natural materials.

Together  they’ll encourage simple  practical steps—such as routine eye checks and reframing eye care as part of holistic healthy aging  so that it becomes an easy and empowering part of daily self-care.As we age  our bodies change in countless ways—including our hormones.1 This shift can have a profound impact on our vision  yet eye health is often left out of the wellness conversation as we age. Findings from a new global survey confirm that while 80% of Americans agree that clear vision is key to feeling confident and youthful  nearly half think they need vision correction but haven’t seen an eye care professional in the past year. Additionally  despite the booming $59.7 billion anti-aging industry’s focus on skin and cosmetic treatments 2 respondents ranked skin as the lowest priority in addressing the realities of aging. On average people prioritize clear vision over outward appearance  but only moderately  with 55% stating they are concerned with wrinkles around their eyes.Those common aging concerns can include vision conditions like presbyopia and cataracts.3 6 Presbyopia typically begins around age 40 and affects over 1 billion people globally.4 The condition makes it harder to focus on close objects. While cataracts  the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide 5 clouds the lens of the eye causing cloudy or blurry vision. Cataracts and presbyopia can both be detected through comprehensive eye exams.3 6 In fact  an annual eye exam can reveal more than 270 health conditions – including diabetes  heart disease  and stroke risk – making it a cornerstone of preventive care and healthy aging.7Naomi Watts: Championing women’s health and vision awareness“As we age and go through menopause  changes in our eyesight are common  yet eye health is still missing from the conversation ” said Naomi Watts.* “Through my partnership with Johnson & Johnson  I want to encourage everyone to see eye health as an essential part of overall well-being. The more we talk about these changes openly  the more empowered we are to take control of how we age. Start today by taking the simple step of scheduling your annual eye exam—it’s one of the easiest ways to protect your vision for the future.”The collaboration builds on Watts’ long-standing advocacy for women’s health and her work as the founder of Stripes Beauty  a company she launched to empower women through science-backed products  education and community during perimenopause and menopause. Watts will help bring greater attention to the impact of hormonal changes during perimenopause and menopause and how these shifts can affect vision. Through this initiative  she aims to raise awareness of the connection between menopause  aging  and eye health  encouraging individuals to prioritize regular eye exams as part of a holistic approach to well-being and longevity.Expert perspective: Eye exams enable confidence and independence“Clear vision isn’t a luxury  it’s an enabler of human potential and a cornerstone of healthy aging ” said optometrist  Dr. Charissa Lee  Head of Professional Affairs  Vision  Johnson & Johnson. “While people invest significantly in skincare and cosmetic treatments to look younger  they often overlook that proper vision correction can help maintain a more relaxed  youthful appearance. As an Eye Care Professional  I believe the comprehensive eye exam and proactive eye care can fundamentally help you feel and look your best as you age.”*Disclosure: This is a paid endorsement. Naomi Watts was compensated for this quote.Key survey findings reveal missed opportunities for healthy aging:Confidence and vision: 82% of Americans agree that clear vision is important to feel youthful and confident.82% of Americans agree that clear vision is important to feel youthful and confident.

However  55% of global respondents aged 40 to 70 expressed concerns regarding the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes.Take action: Make eye exams part of your healthy aging routineJohnson & Johnson encourages individuals over the age of 40 to make vision care a self-care priority.Schedule a comprehensive eye exam: Early detection is key to maintaining confidence and independence.Early detection is key to maintaining confidence and independence.
