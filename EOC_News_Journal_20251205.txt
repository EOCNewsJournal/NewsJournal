54027,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/12/4/why-is-belgium-opposed-to-using-russian-assets-to-support-ukraine,Why is Belgium opposed to using Russian assets to support Ukraine?,Belgium is pushing back against a plan to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's economy and war effort.,Belgium is pushing back against a plan to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s economy and war effort.The European Union has unveiled plans to use billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to help cover Ukraine’s war needs over the next two years. But Belgium is pushing back following the announcement on Wednesday  arguing that the plan carries legal and financial risks that it fears it could end up shouldering alone.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Brussels would supply 90 billion euros ($105bn) of Ukraine’s budget requirements for 2026-27  estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be 137 billion euros ($159bn). She said that other “international partners” would cover the rest.“Today  we are sending a very strong message to the Ukrainian people. We are with them for the long haul ” von der Leyen said.Frozen Russian funds held in Europe would be used as collateral for a “reparations loan” designed to sustain Ukraine’s war effort  and which Ukraine would ultimately pay back after it obtains compensation for the war from Russia.Aid could also be funded through common EU borrowing  but  despite Belgian objections  most European officials have expressed a preference for using frozen Russian assets. The EU’s controversial plan comes as the latest round of United States-led peace talks between Russia and Ukraine shows little sign of progress.Moscow has denounced the reparations loan plan as “theft”.How is the EU proposing to finance Ukraine?Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the European bloc has committed more than 170 billion euros ($197bn) to Ukraine  mainly in the form of military and humanitarian support. The European Commission is now pledging to provide more money for another two years in the form of loans.AdvertisementOn Wednesday  long-awaited details of the EU plan for a “reparations loan” were published. Under it  some 90 billion euros ($104bn) of frozen Russian assets will be used as collateral for a loan to Ukraine.Under a loan arrangement  repayment to creditors – both government and private lenders – will be guaranteed by the present and future earnings of the frozen assets. Ukraine would then repay the loan once Moscow compensates Kyiv for the destruction caused by its invasion.“It’s quite a clever tactic ” Gregoire Roos  director of the Europe and Russia and Eurasia Programmes at Chatham House  told Al Jazeera. “They’re not seizing the assets. Rather  they are keeping them frozen and monetising them.”Roos added that “while assets have been frozen in previous conflicts … this is significant in Europe owing to the scale”.“There is no precedent for this ” he said.Von der Leyen said the funds would provide Ukraine with more leverage in peace talks and demonstrate to Moscow that “the prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them”. She added that Washington had been briefed on the plan.If von der Leyen’s reparations-loan plan fails to win unanimous EU member-state support  she hinted that the EU could fall back on market borrowing. However  this would require unanimous agreement from the bloc  giving Hungary another opportunity to veto Ukraine aid.Hungary has repeatedly vetoed EU assistance to Ukraine because Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government argues that arming Kyiv will prolong the war and increase the EU’s collective debt. Orban has also maintained unusually warm ties with Vladimir Putin compared to other EU leaders.Why does Belgium object to this plan?Belgium worries that Euroclear – the Brussels-based financial clearing house that holds the bulk of the frozen Russian assets – could end up entangled in damaging litigation if Russia challenges the EU decision  or if the action harms Euroclear’s reputation and business model.In theory  Russia could challenge the asset-freeze decision in a court in Belgium  where Euroclear is incorporated.Addressing an audience at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday  Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said: “We are not seeking to antagonise our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return.”Prevot said Belgium views “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky” and “has never been done before”. Instead  he wants the EU to pursue ordinary market borrowing to fund a loan to Ukraine. “It is a well-known  a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters ” he said.AdvertisementHe is strongly supported by Belgian officials who have doubled down on their opposition to the reparations loan in recent weeks  especially after a 28-point plan for a peace deal by the administration of US President Donald Trump was made public  and included plans to use the frozen assets.To address Belgium’s concerns  the European Commission’s blueprint does include measures to shield EU governments from “possible retaliation from Russia”  and to establish an EU-level borrowing mechanism to “underpin a loan to Ukraine”. However  Prevot emphasised that “the reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks”  and argued that the commission’s safeguards do not go far enough  leaving Belgium exposed.“It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks ” he said.How much money is at stake?Some 290 billion euros ($337bn) of Russia’s sovereign wealth – principally in the form of foreign-exchange reserves held as cash and bonds – was frozen by Western powers following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.A large portion of those assets is held in Belgium  where roughly 194 billion euros ($225bn) was held as of June this year. Euroclear alone holds about 183 billion euros ($212bn) of these assets. Smaller amounts of assets are also held in the US  United Kingdom  and Japan.Under a plan agreed by Group of Seven (G7) countries in 2024  Ukraine would be provided with loans to be repaid using the interest earned on Russia’s foreign frozen assets  effectively leaving the assets untouched but allowing Kyiv to benefit from the income they generate.Yesterday’s announcement goes one step further by collateralising the frozen funds.What do Belgium’s EU partners say?On Wednesday  von der Leyen said she was considering Belgium’s objections. “We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns  and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal. We will share the burden in a fair way  as it is the European way ” she said.Other European officials echoed this. Johann Wadephul  Germany’s minister of foreign affairs  said: “We take Belgium’s concerns seriously. They are justified  but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”Elsewhere  David van Weel  the Netherlands’ minister of foreign affairs  highlighted the stakes of Belgium’s recalcitrance. “These funds are really  really important. We need to support the Ukrainian economy; otherwise  they will have a very tough time next year.”Van Weel emphasised that EU member states have listened to Belgium. “We understand the Belgian concerns  and we are willing to at least make sure that they are not alone in this ” he said.Other EU countries have already signalled readiness to backstop potential losses for Belgium.Belgium  meanwhile  has been collecting tax revenue from the immobilised Russian funds  and interest from the assets is already being directed into a G7-organised loan package for Ukraine.AdvertisementLooking ahead  European leaders are set to revisit the issue as well as Ukraine’s broader financing requirements at their Brussels summit on December 18.,neutral,0.0,0.78,0.22,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Belgium', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'United States-led peace talks', 'unanimous EU member-state support', 'International Monetary Fund', 'potential disastrous consequences', 'The European Union', 'ordinary market borrowing', 'next two years', 'other “international partners', 'most European officials', 'other EU leaders', 'The European Commission', 'common EU borrowing', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Frozen Russian funds', 'reparations loan plan', 'Belgian officials', 'financial risks', 'Belgian objections', 'humanitarian support', 'Chatham House', 'unanimous agreement', 'peace deal', 'frozen assets', 'budget requirements', 'strong message', 'Ukrainian people', 'long haul', 'latest round', 'little sign', 'European bloc', 'private lenders', 'future earnings', 'clever tactic', 'Eurasia Programmes', 'Al Jazeera', 'previous conflicts', 'high cost', 'collective debt', 'warm ties', 'Vladimir Putin', 'damaging litigation', 'business model', 'asset-freeze decision', 'member state', 'predictable parameters', 'recent weeks', 'possible retaliation', 'EU assistance', 'EU decision', 'EU governments', 'loan arrangement', 'controversial plan', 'reparations-loan plan', '28-point plan', 'EU plan', 'war effort', 'war needs', '90 billion euros', 'full-scale invasion', '170 billion euros', 'Gregoire Roos', 'same solidarity', 'Ukraine aid', '137 billion', 'Belgium', 'economy', 'plans', 'billions', 'announcement', 'Wednesday', 'legal', 'rest', 'collateral', 'compensation', 'preference', 'progress', 'Moscow', 'February', 'form', 'military', 'money', 'loans', 'Advertisement', 'details', 'repayment', 'creditors', 'present', 'Kyiv', 'destruction', 'director', 'precedent', 'leverage', 'prolongation', 'Washington', 'Hungary', 'opportunity', 'Euroclear', 'bulk', 'action', 'reputation', 'theory', 'court', 'audience', 'NATO', 'headquarters', 'return', 'option', 'robust', 'opposition', 'administration', 'concerns', 'blueprint', 'measures', 'EU-l']",2025-12-04,2025-12-05,aljazeera.com
54028,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine,EU proposes using Russian assets  loans to fund $105bn package to Ukraine,But Belgium  a vocal critic of the plan to use Russian assets to back Ukraine  says its concerns have not been resolved.,But Belgium  a vocal critic of the plan to use Russian assets to back Ukraine  says its concerns have not been resolved.The European Commission has proposed an unprecedented use of frozen Russian assets or international borrowing to raise 90 billion euros ($105bn) to support Ukraine’s war effort against Russia  though critical reservations about the plan from key stakeholder Belgium appear unresolved.The announcement by the European Union’s executive body on Wednesday proposed “two solutions to address Ukraine’s financing needs” for 2026 and 2027.The first option is an EU loan to Kyiv sourced from the private market  while the second preferred option is a “reparations loan” funded using Russian state assets frozen in the EU in response to Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.“[These options] reflect the EU’s commitment to supporting Ukraine not only in defending its sovereignty and maintaining state functions  but also as a strategic investment in Europe’s security and in the pursuit of a just and lasting peace ” the Commission said in a press release.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters that the proposals will ensure Ukraine “has the means” to defend itself  “and take forward peace negotiations from a position of strength”.“We are proposing to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next two years. That’s 90 billion euros. The remainder would be for international partners to cover ” she said.“We are increasing the cost of Russia’s war of aggression. And this should act as a further incentive for Russia to engage at the negotiating table ” von der Leyen added.The Commission president suggested that the proposal to EU member states had taken into account almost all the concerns raised by Belgium  whose Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear is the main holder of the frozen Russian assets.AdvertisementVon der Leyen said the new proposal also covers other financial institutions in the EU holding Russian assets  while EU officials said France  Germany  Sweden and Cyprus also hold such assets that will be used to fund the proposed loan.The Commission also said the scheme does not amount to confiscating the money as it would be in the form of a loan – although Ukraine would only have to redeem it if Russia pays reparations for the war damage caused.The EU could proceed with the frozen assets proposal if 15 out of 27 members vote in favour. The Commission said it hoped to clinch a firm commitment from member states at an EU leaders summit on December 18.The second option – borrowing on international markets – would normally require unanimity among EU countries  which could prove a difficult hurdle as Hungary’s Russia-friendly government has opposed previous funding for Ukraine.Belgium has repeatedly voiced its resistance to the frozen assets plan  suggesting the proposed use of 140 billion euros ($163bn) it holds would imperil a peace deal in the short term while placing it at risk of future crippling legal action by Russia.One demand from Brussels is that EU countries commit to covering all legal costs arising from any future Russian lawsuits challenging the scheme.On Wednesday  hours before the proposal’s presentation  Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot reiterated these reservations  saying the legal texts “do not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner”.“We have repeatedly said that we consider the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky; it has never been done before ” Prevot said. “This explains why we keep on pleading for an alternative  namely the EU borrowing the amounts needed on the markets.”Russia  meanwhile  has said the EU using its assets would constitute theft. On Monday  Andrei Kostin  the head of Russia’s second-largest bank  VTB  threatened the bloc with 50 years of litigation if the idea comes to fruition.Von der Leyen  meanwhile  said United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “positively received” news of the proposed reparation loan. That reported assurance comes despite complexities shrouding the scheme related to the Trump administration’s 28-point plan to end the war  which proposed using some of the assets in a joint US-Russian investment vehicle.Earlier on Wednesday  the EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027  taking a significant stride towards ending the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy.AdvertisementThe EU announced the “historic agreement” had been reached between EU government and European Parliament representatives on June proposals set out by the European Commission to end Russian energy shipments.Under the agreement  member states will halt imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2026. Pipeline gas imports will stop by November 2027.The body said the move allows it to end its “dependence on an unreliable supplier”  which has “repeatedly destabilised European energy markets  put at risk security of supply with energy blackmail and harmed the European economy”.Von der Leyen hailed the move  saying that “today  we enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia”.“By depleting Putin’s war chest  we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector ” she said.Hungary and Slovakia look likely to mount legal challenges to the measure  with both countries still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Russian assets', '$105bn package', 'EU', 'loans', 'Ukraine', 'United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'joint US-Russian investment vehicle', 'future crippling legal action', 'Russian liquefied natural gas', 'Advertisement Von der Leyen', 'The Commission president', 'future Russian lawsuits', 'Brussels-based financial institution', 'other financial institutions', 'Pipeline gas imports', 'European Parliament representatives', 'Russian gas imports', 'Russian energy shipments', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU leaders summit', 'second preferred option', 'next two years', 'The European Commission', 'Russian state assets', 'EU member states', 'European energy markets', 'frozen assets proposal', 'frozen assets plan', 'strategic investment', 'legal costs', 'legal texts', 'European Union', 'two solutions', 'state functions', 'second option', 'energy blackmail', 'European economy', 'vocal critic', 'international borrowing', 'key stakeholder', 'financing needs', 'first option', 'private market', 'lasting peace', 'press release', 'peace negotiations', 'international partners', 'negotiating table', 'main holder', 'international markets', 'difficult hurdle', 'Russia-friendly government', 'previous funding', 'peace deal', 'short term', 'One demand', 'satisfactory manner', 'Andrei Kostin', 'largest bank', 'Trump administration', 'significant stride', 'decades-long dependency', 'unreliable supplier', 'new proposal', '28-point plan', '90 billion euros', 'EU officials', 'EU countries', '140 billion euros', 'reparation loan', 'EU government', 'unprecedented use', 'war effort', 'critical reservations', 'executive body', 'war damage', 'firm commitment', 'historic agreement', 'June proposals', 'EU loan', 'reparations loan', '50 years', 'Belgium', 'Ukraine', 'concerns', 'announcement', 'Wednesday', 'Kyiv', 'response', 'Moscow', '2022 invasion', 'options', 'sovereignty', 'security', 'pursuit', 'just', 'reporters', 'means', 'position', 'strength', 'two-thirds', 'remainder', 'aggression', 'incentive', 'account', 'Euroclear', 'France', 'Germany', 'Sweden', 'Cyprus', 'scheme', 'money', 'form', '27 members', 'favour', 'December', 'unanimity', 'Hungary', 'resistance', 'risk', 'presentation', 'alternative', 'amounts', 'theft', 'Monday', 'head', 'VTB', 'bloc', 'litigation', 'idea', 'fruition', 'news', 'assurance', 'complexities', 'late', 'LNG', 'November', 'move', 'dependence', 'supply']",2025-12-04,2025-12-05,aljazeera.com

The country’s Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot has warned the move would have “potentially disastrous consequences” for his country.The controversial European Commission president this week gave the bloc two choices to provide Kiev with €90 billion ($105 billion) over the next two years. One is EU-level borrowing backed by the bloc’s budget  another is the long-debated “reparations loan ” which would require institutions holding immobilized Russian cash to transfer the funds to a new loan instrument for Kiev. Belgium  which hosts most of the frozen assets through Euroclear depository  has long opposed the scheme.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday  Prevot reiterated that his country considers the loan scheme “the worst of all” options for aiding Kiev and accused the Commission of “downplaying” Belgium’s concerns.“The reparation loan scheme entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks… It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks ” Prevot stressed. Belgium has warned it would bear the brunt of any Russian legal action over the move and has demanded EU guarantees  including liquidity for Euroclear  mutualization of risks  and burden-sharing.Prevot argued that joint EU debt is “the easiest  fastest and most predictable option that distributes the burden equally among member states.”Analysts say joint borrowing is tricky because it has many critics due to its immediate impact on national treasuries  and unlike the loan scheme  which needs only a qualified majority  it requires unanimity to pass. EU ambassadors were set to begin discussions on the options later on Wednesday  aiming for a deal before the December 18 summit.Belgium is not alone in criticizing the loan scheme. Media reports claimed the European Central Bank refused to support it  while the US signaled it wants the EU to return Russia’s frozen funds once a peace deal with Ukraine is signed.Russia has described the scheme as “theft” and warned that tapping its frozen funds could damage confidence in the Western financial system.

The other major holders of Russian assets within the bloc  including France  Luxembourg  and Germany  reportedly continue to oppose an outright seizure  as do other states such as Italy  Hungary  and Slovakia.Russia has denounced the use of its sovereign assets as theft and warned that any seizure would trigger far-reaching legal and retaliatory consequences.

Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences.Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros. Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly in Euroclear  a Belgium-based securities depository.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251203/belgium-disagrees-with-eu-commissions-proposal-to-use-russian-assets---foreign-minister-1123218628.htmlrussiaukrainebelgiumSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleu understands  european union  russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova  understands that the theft  russian assets",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.05,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'EU', 'Seizure', 'Consequences', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Belgian news agency Belga', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Belgium-based securities depository', 'Russian Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'The European Union', 'entire international community', 'belgium european union', 'foreign assets', 'Russian money', 'Russian Assets', 'European accounts', 'Sputnik International', 'large scale', 'criminal scheme', 'active process', 'illegal actions', 'harsh response', 'war effort', '140 billion euros', 'reparations loan', 'material damage', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'assets assets', 'world russia', 'EU countries', 'ukraine belgium', 'legal consequences', 'sputnikglobe', 'seizure', 'russian-assets', 'theft', 'Thursday', 'cdn1.', 'responsibility', 'briefing', 'Moscow', 'November', 'compensation', 'plan', 'fears', 'start', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'disagrees', 'commissions', 'foreign-minister', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-04,2025-12-05,sputnikglobe.com
54032,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/merz-heads-to-brussels-for-crunch-talks-with-belgian-pm-over-russian-assets/,Merz dashes to Brussels for talks with De Wever and VDL on Russian assets,EU leaders are scheduled to discuss the initiative in Brussels on Dec. 18.,De Wever continues to oppose the initiative  as the lion’s share of the assets is under the stewardship of Brussels-based financial depository  Euroclear. He fears that Russia will retaliate against Belgium at home and abroad  and is demanding ironclad financial guarantees from EU capitals before he even considers backing the Commission’s proposal.EU leaders are scheduled to discuss the initiative in Brussels on Dec. 18. Failure to reach a deal could force EU governments to use taxpayers’ money to ensure Ukraine’s survival.Even so  De Wever will take some convincing  as von der Leyen is well aware after holding her own crunch talks with the Belgian leader — which didn't succeed in moving him.Not only does De Wever want substantial guarantees that can be paid out at a moment’s notice  but he’s demanding that other financial institutions holding Russian state assets across the bloc are held to the same standard as Euroclear.The Belgians also fear an army of Kremlin lawyers will sue the government and Euroclear on the basis of a bilateral investment treaty that the country signed with the Soviet Union in 1989. Russia’s former president  Dmitry Medvedev  has repeatedly threatened that.“If the crazy EU does steal frozen Russian assets for a ‘reparations loan ’ we may view it as a casus belli with all the relevant implications for Brussels & Co ” Medvedev posted Thursday on social media. “Then  these funds may have to be returned  not in court but as real reparations paid in kind by Russia’s fallen foes.”,neutral,0.02,0.71,0.27,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['De Wever', 'Russian assets', 'Merz', 'Brussels', 'talks', 'VDL', 'Brussels-based financial depository', 'von der Leyen', 'other financial institutions', 'bilateral investment treaty', 'ironclad financial guarantees', 'Russian state assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'substantial guarantees', 'De Wever', 'EU capitals', 'EU leaders', 'EU governments', 'taxpayers’ money', 'crunch talks', 'Belgian leader', 'same standard', 'The Belgians', 'Kremlin lawyers', 'Soviet Union', 'former president', 'crazy EU', 'reparations loan', 'relevant implications', 'social media', 'real reparations', 'Dmitry Medvedev', 'initiative', 'lion', 'share', 'stewardship', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'Commission', 'proposal', 'Dec.', 'Failure', 'deal', 'Ukraine', 'survival', 'convincing', 'moment', 'notice', 'bloc', 'army', 'basis', 'country', 'casus', 'funds', 'court', 'kind', 'foes']",2025-12-04,2025-12-05,politico.eu

54036,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/russia-europes-use-of-frozen-assets-could-be-justification-for-war-.html,Europe's plan to use $105 billion of frozen Russian assets tantamount to war  says Russia's Medvedev,It follows fresh proposals by the European Commission to unlock $105 billion to support Ukraine.,"Russia's security council chief warned on Thursday that should the European Union use its seized frozen assets to support Ukraine  that could be tantamount to justification for war. The European Commission  the executive arm of the EU  has been looking at how to use frozen Russian assets held in Europe to further support Ukraine. The move could be tantamount to an act justifying war  Dmitry Medvedev  deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council  said in a comment posted to Telegram and translated by Google. ""If a frantic European Union attempts to steal Russian assets frozen in Belgium by issuing a so-called reparations loan  such actions could be classified under international law as a special kind of casus belli  with all the ensuing consequences for Brussels and individual EU countries "" Medvedev said  referring to the Latin phrasing for an act that justifies war.watch nowRussia has previously said it would retaliate if the EU went ahead with using frozen assets option. The Commission has argued that the move is not theft  given it would be a loan and Ukraine would only have to repay it if Russia pays reparations. Russia and the European Commission did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Unlocking $105 billionOn Wednesday the Commission proposed a ""Reparations Loan"" for Ukraine which would involve using cash from the balances of European financial institutions holding frozen Russian Central Bank assets. It also proposed borrowing the funds from international markets  offering member states an alternative to using Russian capital. Under the proposal to use the frozen assets  it plans to unlock 90 billion euros ($105 billion) for the effort  which is around two-thirds of the International Monetary Fund's $136.5 billion estimation of Ukraine's financing gap for 2026 to 2029. ""With Russia continuing to show no sign of willingness to commit to a just and sustainable peace  the strain on Ukraine's resources continues to grow  making sustained EU support all the more vital "" the Commission said in a statement. So far  European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv  but some European leaders have expressed concerns about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues.Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin  aimed at finding a solution to end the Ukraine war  in Moscow  Russia on December 2  2025. Kremlin Press Office/Anadolu via Getty ImagesBelgium has been particularly tough on the subject  given that it hosts Euroclear — the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belgium's leadership has expressed concerns about the legal implications once the war is over and wants EU countries to commit to burden-sharing the responsibilities. One EU official  who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic  told CNBC  ""If the EU chooses to borrow money to support Ukraine  this will need unanimity.

DEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AG (ISIN: DE000A0XFSF0) (“Company”) expects fewer property sales for the 2025 financial year than planned at the beginning of the year due to sales transactions deliberately postponed until the coming year. This results in a larger portfolio  which will generate higher rental income and  consequently  higher funds from operations I (FFO I after taxes  before minority interests and interest on shareholder loans). In addition  cost items at both the property and company levels were kept below budgeted values  which also had an upward effect on the funds from operations I.Against this backdrop  the Company's management board has today decided to adjust its forecast for the 2025 financial year in light of the revised sales expectations and lower cost projections. As a result  the management board now expects rental income to be at the upper end of the previous forecast of EUR 52.0 million to EUR 54.0 million and funds from operations I (FFO I after taxes  before minority interests and interest on shareholder loans) of EUR 9.0 million to EUR 11.0 million (previously EUR 5.0 million to EUR 7.0 million).Contact:Julius StinauerHead of Investor Relations & Corporate FinanceDEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AGTelefon: +49 6103 372 4944Email: stinauer@demire.agEnd of Inside InformationGlobeNewswire Distribution Services include regulatory announcements  financial/corporate news and press releases.Archive at www.globenewswire.com,neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['larger portfolio base', 'lower costs', 'DEMIRE', 'guidance', 'DEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AG', 'larger portfolio base', 'lower costs Langen', 'lower cost projections', 'GlobeNewswire Distribution Services', 'higher rental income', 'fewer property sales', 'cost items', 'sales transactions', 'sales expectations', 'Keyword(s', 'inside information', 'EU) No', 'minority interests', 'shareholder loans', 'upward effect', 'management board', 'Investor Relations', 'Corporate Finance', 'regulatory announcements', 'financial/corporate news', 'press releases', 'higher funds', '2025 financial year', 'coming year', 'upper end', 'Julius Stinauer', 'company levels', 'previous forecast', 'Change', 'guidance', '04.

This initiative is fully aligned with ARGAN’s ambitious environmental policy.The simultaneous commissioning of this equipment across all four sites marks the successful completion of a coordinated project carried out on occupied premises  without any disruption to logistics operations.A major environmental impact: 700 tons of CO₂ avoided each year  equivalent to the annual emissions of 120 French citizens.This project is fully in line with ARGAN’s goal of reducing the carbon emissions of its portfolio  with the aim to lower them from 24 000 tons in 2022 to 12 000 tons in 2030  i.e.  -50%.A partnership that reflects ARGAN’s DNAThis rollout fully reflects ARGAN’s DNA: supporting its tenant-clients as their logistics networks evolve toward ever more efficient  resilient  and decarbonized solutions. ARGAN’s ability to design and manage technical solutions tailored to each site strengthens the energy efficiency of its portfolio and contributes to the performance of its partners.Stéphane CASSAGNE  ARGAN’s Head of Asset Management and Development:“The coordinated rollout of heat pumps across all DECATHLON warehouses demonstrates the strength of our partnership and our ability to deliver efficient  sustainable  and immediately operational solutions. The reduction of 700 tons of CO₂ per year is a tangible result that directly contributes to our climate objectives.”2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

This film is a human  historical and technological odyssey  that blends our best creative minds with our unmatched capabilities in AI production to embody our belief that the future of AI is our people.""About the film:A unique ‘hybrid' project‘A Lion Never Gives Up’ blends live action  GenAI 2D & 3D imaging to reconstitute scenes from our past  reducing the price of scene reconstruction and opening up new creative possibilities.A quarter of the film is live action footage  with the rest created by AI  drawing on photos  films and documents from Publicis’ own archives.A huge volume of visual assetsAI prompt artists and AI archivists managed  sourced and catalogued both the volume of real images needed for a project of this size - 4 500 for 150 individual shots - and the AI-generated ones.A reinvented editing process:In a traditional pipeline  once you reach the editing stage  everything is locked in.

As a result  BIC decided to wind down the operational activities of Rocketbook  Inkbox and Tattly by the first quarter of 2026.This decision does not affect BIC’s full-year 2025 financial outlook and is expected to have minimal impact on net sales and adjusted EBIT margin in 2025.Rob Versloot  CEO  said: “I want to thank all our team members at Rocketbook  Inkbox and Tattly for their hard work and dedication. It is however my responsibility to ensure that all our activities contribute to Group’s growth and profitability. Unfortunately  Rocketbook and our Skin Creative businesses did not deliver on their initial expectations  posting significant declines in net sales and profitability since their acquisitions. This decision reflects my determination to shift gears and build a strong foundation for the future of BIC.”***ContactsBrice ParisVP Investor Relations+33 6 42 87 54 73brice.paris@bicworld.comInvestor Relationsinvestors.info@bicworld.comBethridge ToovellVP Global Communications+1 917 821 4249bethridge.toovell@bicworld.comIsabelle de SegonzacImage 7  Press Relations contact+33 6 89 87 61 39isegonzac@image7.frAgendaAll dates to be confirmedFull Year 2025 Results February 24  2026 First Quarter 2026 Net Sales April 28  2026 Annual General Meeting May 20  2026About BICA global leader in stationery  lighters  and shavers  BIC brings simplicity and joy to everyday life.

Reports Q3 2025 Financial Results and Business UpdatesNew analysis of data from varoglutamstat Phase 2 program for patients with lower baseline eGFR shows consistent and pronounced treatment effect  further supporting plans to advance development in stage 3b/4 DKDCompelling kidney function data from VIVIAD Phase 2b study presented in late-breaking poster session at ASN kidney week  the world’s premier nephrology meetingSuccessful completion of private placement supported by existing and new shareholders raising EUR 5.1 million; extends cash runway well into Q3 2026  providing financial runway and flexibility to realize strategic partnershipManagement to host conference call today at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am EST)Halle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  December 4  2025 - Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company developing small molecule medicines for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  with a primary focus on kidney diseases  today announced financial results for the nine-month period ended September 30  2025  and provided a corporate update.“The third quarter of 2025 and year to date have been marked by continued advancements towards realizing the full potential of varoglutamstat  including successfully completing a capital raise that provides us with financial runway and flexibility to advance our strategic objectives ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Our recent analyses of VIVIAD/VIVA-MIND data continue to underscore the unique potential of varoglutamstat to meaningfully improve kidney function in patients with diabetes. A new analysis was conducted across patients with different eGFR baseline levels  which indicate different degrees of kidney function impairment  to evaluate how patients with impaired kidney function respond to varoglutamstat. Here  we saw a consistent and pronounced treatment effect across all patients and  importantly  we also saw this effect in patients with more impaired kidney function  as indicated by low baseline eGFRs. These results give us further confidence in our plan to advance varoglutamstat into a Phase 2b study in stage 3b/4 diabetic kidney disease.” He concluded  “Building on the beneficial effects on inflammation and fibrosis that we are observing with varoglutamstat  we see potential for this promising drug class to be relevant across a broader range of immune-mediated diseases. Here  our core expertise and differentiated platform of oral small-molecule QPCT/L inhibitors allow us to selectively explore additional development and partnership opportunities alongside our primary focus of advancing the DKD program.”Q3 2025 and Post-Period UpdatesVaroglutamstat Clinical ProgramVivoryon’s varoglutamstat Phase 2 program has shown highly consistent  statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of kidney function (eGFR) versus placebo in two independent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The Company is planning to confirm the previously reported compelling data from its two independent Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  by conducting a dedicated Phase 2b clinical study in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stage 3b/4. Initiation of the Phase 2b and all future studies is subject to additional funding and/or partnership  which Vivoryon continues to actively explore.VIVIAD study data shows consistent treatment effect across eGFR levels in the lower eGFR percentilesNew analysis of pooled data from Vivoryon’s varoglutamstat Phase 2 program revealed a consistent treatment effect in both the total population and in patients with diabetes.In patients with diabetes within the lower eGFR percentiles (50%/ 33.3%/ 25%/ 20%)  mean eGFR baseline levels ranged from 65-56 mL/min/1.73m 2 and the treatment effect was in the range of 5.3-7.7 mL/min/1.73m 2 /year.and the treatment effect was in the range of 5.3-7.7 mL/min/1.73m /year. These results further support Vivoryon’s rationale for a dedicated Phase 2b clinical study in patients with advanced DKD stage 3b/4.VIVIAD study data presented at ASNOn November 6  2025  the Company presented a late-breaking poster titled “Correlation of eGFR and pE-CCL2 in Older Adult Patients Treated with Varoglutamstat: Data from VIVIAD  a Phase 2B Randomized Clinical Trial”  at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025  the world’s premier nephrology meeting.The poster featured VIVIAD Phase 2 clinical study data underscoring varoglutamstat’s unique ability to stabilize and even improve kidney function  as measured by eGFR values and highlighted further analyses of total population data from the VIVIAD study  evaluating the correlation of pE-CCL2 levels and eGFR slope on an individual participant level  which revealed a statistically significant correlation between the change from baseline in pE-CCL2 serum levels at week 48 and the eGFR slope over time. Specifically  a decrease in pE-CCL2 was significantly correlated with a positive (improved) eGFR slope.Corporate Development UpdatesFollowing her temporary partial leave of absence to attend to a serious family health matter  reported by Vivoryon on September 4  2025  Anne Doering will be stepping down as the Company’s CFO in December 2025. Marcus Irsfeld  an experienced finance executive with deep life sciences expertise  who has been working with Vivoryon as a strategic consultant since December 2024 and has assumed the role of acting CFO during Ms. Doering’s leave of absence  will succeed Ms. Doering as Vivoryon’s permanent CFO. Mr. Irsfeld is expected to stand for election as executive member of the Company’s Board at the 2026 Annual General Meeting.On October 6  2025  Vivoryon successfully completed a private placement raising EUR 5.1 million by issuing 3 380 500 new shares at a purchase price of EUR 1.50 per new share. The placement was supported by existing and new shareholders and the capital raised extends the Company’s cash runway well into Q3 2026  with proceeds providing the financial runway and flexibility to realize strategic partnership for varoglutamstat in chronic kidney disease.Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30  2025Revenues were zero in the nine months ended September 30  2025  as well as in the nine months ended September 30  2024.Research and development expenses decreased by EUR 8.9 million to EUR 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30  2025  compared to EUR 12.6 million in the nine months ended September 30  2024. This reduction was largely attributable to a decrease in clinical development costs of EUR 7.2 million from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies and a reduction in production costs of EUR 1.2 million. R&D expenses in the reporting period mainly occurred for kidney-related research.General and administrative expenses were EUR 4.0 million in the nine months ended September 30  2025  compared to EUR 4.9 million in the nine months ended September 30  2024. The decrease was largely attributable to lower personnel costs due to a decrease in non-cash effective share-based payments.Net loss for the nine months ended September 30  2025  was EUR 7.6 million  compared to EUR 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2024.The Company held EUR 2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30  2025  compared to EUR 9.4 million as of December 31  2024.Outlook & Financial GuidanceIncluding the proceeds from the private placement completed in October 2025  the Company expects  based on its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans well into Q3 2026  subject to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and without taking into account any funds possibly raised under the SEPA as well as other potential additional financing transactions  if any. This guidance is in line with the cash runway update published on October 6  2025.This cash runway guidance reflects an overall reduction in cash utilization including the conclusion of the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies while prudently investing in preparing to execute on the Company’s kidney disease strategy. The initiation of the Phase 2b DKD study and all future studies is subject to further additional funding and/or partnership  which the Company continues to actively explore.The viability of the Company’s business beyond its current guidance is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.The Company expects to have continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations. The Company has concluded that the ability to continue as a going concern in the financial year 2026  as stated in the Company‘s Annual Report 2024 published on April 29  2025  depends on the ability to generate additional funding. As such the Company has concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2024 for further information.Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  December 4  2025  at 3:00 pm CET (9:00 am EST).

I told you about Alexis: he’s their leader  what did they need two years of wandering around for? For them (the Syriza crowd)  he’s what Andreas was for the true  dyed-in-the-wool Pasok folks — their idol. They say: with him we became somebody  we ate bread  we made money  in short… thanks to him we lived comfortably for five years. What can Kasselakis tell them and what can Famellos and Haritsis together tell them? Alexis has them for breakfast. You saw them all together now — did you miss them  I wonder? Do you want them back in government? These are the people Androulakis and Doukas want to “talk” to? Because when we say “Progressive Camp ” this is who we mean — these are the ones  just so we don’t get confused. And yesterday they were all there at what was essentially the presentation of Alexis’ new party  cheerful and unchanged.He wants those people?– You might wonder  does yesterday’s event help Tsipras? Depends how you look at it — it’s like what we say about the… cucumber: one person eats it and suffers  another eats it and feels refreshed. On the one hand  if Tsipras didn’t want all of them sitting there  he would’ve sent personal invitations — not opened the doors — and would have excluded MPs of other parties or the old SYRIZA  New Left  etc. On the other hand  whoever saw them all together yesterday as one package— well  what else would they think except that… the nightingales have reunited? So whoever doesn’t like them and saw them all together will probably think twice about going with Alexis — but I think the chief has accounted for all that from the start. In any case  get-well-soons to all the “Democratic Forces”!What they say at M.M.– At M.M. they weren’t exactly wearing black over yesterday’s “Pallas” event  since they consider it certain that on the way to the polls they will face Tsipras  not his various Factions. “They didn’t need two years of wandering to go back to Tsipras ” they say  and remind us that “Mitsotakis has beaten Tsipras many times; so it won’t be the first  as it seems — nor the last.” Truth is  Mitsotakis needs Tsipras across from him  with the whole troupe  to remind people of 2015–19. Only Polakis is missing — but who knows  there’s still plenty of time.The extension for electricity and Friday’s meeting– Back to earth  and on the farmers’ issue: let me tell you that the government is trying to pull… rabbits out of the hat  besides the scheduled payments. K.M. hinted yesterday at the KYSEA Economic Council that “something better” is coming for electricity  and I understand the government is looking into extending the cheap agricultural electricity that was planned — through 2026 as well. Otherwise  Friday noon  farmers and livestock breeders from Crete are expected at the Bodossaki Mansion to discuss their issues with Chatzidakis and Tsiaras  with regional governor Arnaoutakis joining them. As for today’s dinner K.M. is having with ND MPs of the Economic Affairs Committee at “Karavitis ” I wrote to you yesterday: complaints from MPs of agricultural regions about the pile-up of problems  lack of liquidity  etc.  should be considered a given.Underestimating the KKE– “Blue” MPs  though  who have a sense of what’s happening both in the Plains and elsewhere  say the government underestimated the influence of the KKE. The successors of the late Vaggelis Boutas are proving productive  while farmers’ unionists aligned with ND are also “playing ball” with them. Typical examples of “red” farmers are Rizos Maroudas of Larissa and Kostas Tzellas of Karditsa  while close by are the New Democrats Christos Sideropoulos  Giannis Koukoutsis  etc. A special case is that of Serres  where in the “cradle of Karamanlism ” farmers who are basically ND — and even further right — have “climbed the barricades.”“The rose to the flower”– Now to something more social: you must have seen Kimberly Guilfoyle’s visit to Parliament yesterday  where Nikitas Kaklamanis welcomed her on the steps with a red rose in hand. An eavesdropper told me the President said the unforgettable line: “the rose is for the flower.” And she also left Chatzidakis’ office with a gift — besides the view  the deputy PM offered her a scarf from the Benaki Museum. I hear that afterward the ambassador told her entourage she’s crazy about scarves.Euronext changes everything at the Greek Stock Exchange– A completely different environment in every respect awaits with the integration of the Greek Stock Exchange into the Euronext platform. From market hours to commissions and technological changes — everything is expected to change. All exchanges on the platform  even those of the European South  like Portugal for example  finish their sessions at 18:30 Greek time. This means it will be difficult for Athens to be exempt from such a rule. If this happens — nothing has been officially announced — it will logically require two shifts for brokers. Roughly translated  that means operational costs increased by about 20%. On the other hand  significant investments in technology will be needed for brokerage operations  as the environment is different. Large brokerages  for example  have servers at the Athens Exchange to facilitate transactions with international clients. Such services are expected to become more expensive  and a rise in the general operating fees they pay should also be considered likely. What will likely become cheaper are the commissions investors pay to brokerages.Acquisitions– All of the above easily lead to the conclusion that the brokerage-services market will sooner or later move toward consolidation  which is why scenarios for acquisitions of brokerage firms are already circulating. The procedures for completing the agreement are speeding up  and estimates say the cycle will close—despite procedural difficulties—by the end of the first half of 2026. Still  it’s no easy task  since the changes are practically earth-shaking for the ecosystem of the Greek Stock Exchange. Just consider that transaction clearing will very likely be carried out in Italy. According to some reliable information  the Hellenic Exchanges will issue a balance sheet at year-end  meaning within the first 10 days of January—something far from easy.Two conferences  two countries… just a hologram apart– Once upon a time  you’d have said this looked like a scene out of a sci-fi movie. Today  it’s reality. At Grant Thornton’s AI conference  Christos Megalou and Evangelos Mytilineos appeared as… holograms. Even though their physical selves were many kilometers away  in London  where they were attending the Morgan Stanley & Athens Exchange conference  their digital “versions” made an appearance in Athens. Their message was prerecorded  but imagine if artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies will soon be able to turn physical presence into a multiply deployable resource.The new companies of the Spanós and Kallitsantsis families– Yesterday  the Spanós family of Bioiatriki established a holding company. Its name is “Biolife Healthcare Group S.A.” with trade name “Biolife Healthcare ” and its purpose is holding-company services  investment-advisory services  and investments (in shares  securities  real estate  etc.). Its share capital was set at €20 790 000  fully paid in at incorporation. The share capital corresponds to €24 999 in cash and €20 765 001 in contributions in kind.Now  Giorgos Spanós (President & CEO of Bioiatriki) contributed assets worth €15 717 240 corresponding to 5 239 080 shares (a 75.60% stake). His mother  Andromachi Spanou  contributed assets worth €4 066 524 corresponding to 1 355 508 shares (a 19.56% stake)  and his sister  Dimitra Spanou  contributed assets worth €1 006 236 corresponding to 335 412 shares (a 4.84% stake).The first Board of Directors consists of three members: Giorgos Spanós (Chairman & CEO)  Andromachi Spanou (Vice-Chairwoman)  and Dimitra Spanou (member).However  the family of Dimitris Kallitsantsis—once among the key shareholders and managers of the Ellaktor Group—also incorporated a new company yesterday. The new company is named “SPT Real Estate Development” (“SPT Αναπτυξιακή Ακινήτων”) and will operate in the real-estate sector. The initial share capital is €25 000  paid in by the Cypriot company “Blend 7 Ventures Limited ” represented by Kallitsantsis’ son  Paris. He himself assumed the roles of Chairman and CEO of “SPT Real Estate Development ” whose Board also includes Dimitris Kallitsantsis and Michalis Katounas.Athanasiou’s book– A packed room at the presentation of the book Why They Succeeded: 6 States from the Shadows to the Top by Odysseas Athanasiou  CEO of LAMDA Development  at the full auditorium of the National Gallery  where—besides the author—professor of History at the University of Athens Maria Efthymiou and Bank of Greece governor Yiannis Stournaras also spoke.For LAMDA’s chief  the idea for the book was born  among other things  years ago on a trip to Singapore  where he saw how a small country with no natural resources could reach the world’s top. The book focuses on six cases: Portugal of the seafarers  Venice of the merchants  the Netherlands of innovations  Estonia of the digital revolution  South Korea of technology  and Singapore of international trade—small countries with major obstacles that nevertheless managed to become global reference points.A long list of attendees was present at the book launch: politicians  local-government officials  businesspeople  among them Deputy PM Kostis Hatzidakis  Education Minister Sofia Zacharaki  Minister of State Akis Skertsos  Grigoris Dimitriadis  the mayor of Elliniko Giannis Konstantatos  the mayor of Vari-Voula-Vouliagmeni Grigoris Konstantellos  Stergios Pitsiorlas  Achilleas Konstantakopoulos  Michalis Tsamaz  Dimitris Koutras  Giorgos Patoulis and many others.Eletson’s Ithaki– The case of the tanker Ithacki brings once again to the surface the hidden battles between hedge funds and traditional Greek shipping families. U.S. District Judge David Morales rejected the order to detain the vessel. The Canadian hedge fund Murchinson  after entering Greece-based Eletson Holdings through the Chapter 11 process in New York  managed to secure control of the company. But the Karastamatis  Kertsikoff  and Chatzi-Eleftheriadis families did not give up and sought to retain control of the subsidiary Eletson Gas.The Ithacki  a 12 000-cbm vessel built in 2018  became a symbol of this conflict. Overall  the Ithacki case is not just a dispute over an LPG carrier. It is proof that today’s maritime chessboard combines traditional family structures  modern financial instruments  and judicial “stepping stones ” and whoever understands the strategy behind vessel movements also understands the real power struggle.A shift in philosophy from Anna Angelicoussis– Anna Angelicoussis is moving into the container-ship sector through Alpha Bulkers  making a dynamic comeback in newbuilding investments. This marks a noteworthy shift in philosophy  since historically the Greek shipowner invested in bulk carriers through this company. Now she is entering the “hot” segment of feeder container ships with orders for 11 vessels at three Chinese shipyards.The company is expanding its portfolio in a segment with strong demand and a projected vessel shortage in coming years. In numbers  the estimated investment of roughly $500 million is significant for a company with a fleet of 34 ships  indicating that Alpha Bulkers anticipates steadily high charter rates and premiums in this category.The size spread from 1 900 to 4 500 TEU shows strategic flexibility: smaller feeders for short routes or niche markets  and larger 4 500-TEU ships for routes requiring greater scale. The choice of three different Chinese shipyards reduces geopolitical and operational risk while benefiting from negotiation power in prices and timelines.Overall  Angelicoussis’ move is not merely a traditional fleet expansion. It is a strategic placement in a market segment promising higher margins and greater income predictability while diversifying risk away from the traditional bulker markets. If the feeder market remains “hot ” Alpha Bulkers stands to benefit considerably  strengthening its position in the international container space without abandoning its core competency in bulkers.Wall Street and Shipping– Over the past decade  the U.S. shipping market has seen a substantial shrinking of the number of listed companies  with share prices and the number of firms down by roughly 40%–50% from the 2015 peak. This decline is not due to temporary market fluctuations but to a structural shift directly tied to two major forces: consolidation and privatization.In practice  the fewer publicly listed companies now face a critical dilemma: either grow significantly through strategic mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale  or consider delisting and moving to private-capital management.This trend is also evident in IPO data: after Gener8 Maritime in 2015  only Zim in 2021 executed a proper public listing. The entry of new players via public markets is extremely limited  reinforcing consolidation and reducing market liquidity.The market now shows a clear bifurcation: large  well-capitalized companies merge or absorb smaller ones  while small and mid-sized companies—when unable to meet growing scale and capital demands—are either acquired or taken private. This trend reflects the long-term shift of the shipping market toward a limited number of major players with stable financial profiles.,neutral,0.24,0.6,0.16,mixed,0.32,0.23,0.46,True,English,"['Alexis’ nightingales', 'M.M.', 'Democratic Forces', 'PASOK', 'Nikitas', 'flower', 'wool Pasok folks', 'KYSEA Economic Council', 'regional governor Arnaoutakis', 'Economic Affairs Committee', 'late Vaggelis Boutas', 'Greek Stock Exchange', 'cheap agricultural electricity', 'agricultural regions', '18:30 Greek time', 'two years', 'Syriza crowd', 'five years', 'Progressive Camp', 'new party', 'one person', 'personal invitations', 'other parties', 'old SYRIZA', 'New Left', 'one package', 'Democratic Forces', 'M.M.', 'various Factions', 'scheduled payments', 'K.M.', 'livestock breeders', 'Bodossaki Mansion', 'Typical examples', 'Rizos Maroudas', 'Kostas Tzellas', 'New Democrats', 'Christos Sideropoulos', 'Giannis Koukoutsis', 'Kimberly Guilfoyle', 'Nikitas Kaklamanis', 'unforgettable line', 'deputy PM', 'Benaki Museum', 'different environment', 'market hours', 'technological changes', 'European South', 'two shifts', 'operational costs', 'significant investments', 'one hand', 'other hand', 'farmers’ issue', 'farmers’ unionists', 'red” farmers', 'Pallas” event', 'Blue” MPs', 'special case', 'red rose', 'Chatzidakis’ office', 'Euronext platform', 'ND MPs', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'Alexis', 'leader', 'Andreas', 'idol', 'somebody', 'bread', 'money', 'Kasselakis', 'Famellos', 'Haritsis', 'breakfast', 'government', 'people', 'Androulakis', 'Doukas', 'presentation', 'Tsipras', 'cucumber', 'doors', 'nightingales', 'chief', 'start', 'yesterday', 'way', 'polls', 'Mitsotakis', 'Truth', 'troupe', 'Polakis', 'plenty', 'extension', 'Friday', 'meeting', 'earth', 'rabbits', 'something', 'Crete', 'issues', 'Tsiaras', 'today', 'dinner', 'Karavitis', 'complaints', 'pile-up', 'problems', 'lack', 'liquidity', 'KKE', 'sense', 'Plains', 'influence', 'successors', 'ball', 'Larissa', 'Karditsa', 'Serres', 'cradle', 'Karamanlism', 'barricades', 'flower', 'visit', 'Parliament', 'steps', 'eavesdropper', 'President', 'gift', 'view', 'scarf', 'ambassador', 'entourage', 'scarves', 'everything', 'respect', 'integration', 'commissions', 'exchanges', 'Portugal', 'sessions', 'Athens', 'rule', 'brokers', 'technology']",2025-12-04,2025-12-05,en.protothema.gr
