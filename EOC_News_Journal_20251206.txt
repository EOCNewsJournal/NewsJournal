The final financing decision will be made at the EU summit in December  following consultations. A government source said that a specific process for unlocking 8 billion pounds of Russian assets held in the UK and transferring them to Ukraine has not yet been devised. The European Commission is seeking to get EU countries to use the Russian Central Bank's assets to finance Ukraine's war effort. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around 140 billion euros in Russian money could be used as a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine would only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage"" from Russia. Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros. Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly in Euroclear  a Belgium-based securities depository.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251204/eu-understands-that-seizure-of-russian-assets-will-have-consequences-1123226868.htmlunited kingdom (uk)russiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaluk ready to transfer frozen russian assets  uk government  russian assets to support ukraine",negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Lacks Process', 'UK', 'Reports', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'leyen united kingdom', 'The European Commission', 'russia ukraine european union', 'final financing decision', 'Belgium-based securities depository', 'Russian Central Bank', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Belgian news agency', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Sputnik International uk', 'European accounts', 'frozen assets', 'foreign assets', 'Russian money', 'assets assets', 'Lacks Process', '8 billion pounds', 'Times newspaper', 'government sources', '90 billion euros', 'financial needs', 'EU summit', 'specific process', 'EU countries', 'war effort', '140 billion euros', 'reparations loan', 'material damage', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'UK government', 'legal consequences', 'sputnikglobe', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'process---reports', 'mechanism', 'world', 'cdn1.', 'Wednesday', 'December', 'consultations', 'November', 'Belga', 'compensation', 'plan', 'fears', 'start', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'seizure', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-05,2025-12-06,sputnikglobe.com

The stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield  the stronger it is in the negotiations.""She once again pleaded for ’reparation loans’ that would send ’a triple message’: ’a very strong message to Ukraine showing that we are here to help it defend itself’; ’a second message to Moscow showing that it cannot ""outlive"" us’; and ’a third message to Washington showing that we are taking very firm and credible action’.• According to a preparatory document from the European Commission  three options were on the table:– bilateral loans;– a European loan pledged from the EU budget;– a ""repair loan"" mobilizing the Bank of Russia’s assets immobilized in the EU  mainly within Euroclear  a central securities depository based in Belgium.• If the European unilateral coercive measures against Russia are not renewed  Moscow will immediately take steps to recover the immobilized assets. The financial package of the envisaged ""repair loan"" provides for Euroclear to transfer very large amounts of cash in a very short period of time.According to the Financial Times  the European Central Bank (ECB) has refused to act as lender of last resort to provide such liquidity  likening such a practice to substituting for the obligations of eurozone countries.• EC President Ursula von der Leyen assures that she will only take €90 billion in Russian assets  but once instituted  the process could allow her to seize the whole of the frozen €210 billion.• Belgium opposes anything that could be considered as a confiscation of Russian assets frozen at Euroclear. It intends to protect property rights and to protect itself in three ways:(1) Participating EU countries will have to provide ""legally binding  unconditional  irrevocable  on-demand  shared and solidary guarantees  based on their gross national income  to ensure that the European Union is always able to repay the funds without receiving compensatory payments from Ukraine"".They will have to pay their share of the guarantees that would go to countries which  like Hungary  do not participate in the future loan.(2) In the event of a legal dispute initiated by the Russian authorities and based on the bilateral investment treaty between Belgium and Russia  the EU should assume any ""financial responsibility"" arising from a possible judgment.The Belgian head of government is of the opinion that Russia will attack Euroclear’s assets  or those of its clients  located in Russia and in the countries allied with Moscow.(3) EU Member States and G7 countries holding Russian public assets will have to take part in the financial operation.• On 3 December  the European Commission presented a legislative proposal to continue financing Ukraine in 2026 and 2027  in line with the commitment made by the European Council at the end of October  excluding Hungary. The financial and legal burden will be shared among member states ""fairly  as is the tradition in Europe "" von der Leyen assured. This law would allow both to circumvent the rule of European unanimity and to demand a share from Hungary.• On his arrival at the NATO Ministerial Meeting  Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot expressed a ""frustrating feeling of not having been heard"". He considered that the European Commission’s proposal ""does not satisfactorily address our concerns"". However  ""if the Member States wish to embark on this path  we demand that the risks that Belgium faces as a result of this scheme be fully covered"". In other words  Belgium refuses to assume not only the entire risk  but even only its own share.• President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde of France commented on 3rd December that the European Commission’s proposal is ""exaggerated"" and that she hopes it is in line with international law.",neutral,0.23,0.71,0.05,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['The European Union', 'authoritarian power', 'warmongering', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot', 'EC President Ursula von der Leyen', 'European unilateral coercive measures', 'Estonian Kaja Kallas', 'central securities depository', 'binding, unconditional, irrevocable', 'gross national income', 'NATO Ministerial Meeting', 'bilateral investment treaty', 'EU High Representative', 'European Central Bank', 'Russian public assets', 'Participating EU countries', 'EU Member States', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Belgian head', 'bilateral loans', 'European Commission', 'European loan', 'European Union', 'European Council', 'European unanimity', 'Russian authorities', 'EU budget', 'Russian assets', 'Security Policy', 'difficult period', 'reparation loans', 'triple message', 'strong message', 'second message', 'third message', 'credible action', 'preparatory document', 'three options', 'repair loan', 'large amounts', 'short period', 'last resort', 'property rights', 'three ways', 'compensatory payments', 'future loan', 'legal dispute', 'possible judgment', 'legal burden', 'frustrating feeling', 'other words', 'entire risk', 'Christine Lagarde', 'immobilized assets', 'financial package', 'Financial Times', 'eurozone countries', 'financial responsibility', 'G7 countries', 'financial operation', 'solidary guarantees', 'international law', 'legislative proposal', '3rd December', 'stronger Ukraine', '1 December', '3 December', 'peace', 'battlefield', 'negotiations', 'Moscow', 'Washington', 'firm', 'table', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'steps', 'very', 'cash', 'ECB', 'lender', 'liquidity', 'practice', 'obligations', 'process', 'confiscation', 'demand', 'funds', 'share', 'Hungary', 'event', 'government', 'opinion', 'clients', 'financing', 'line', 'commitment', 'October', 'tradition', 'rule', 'arrival', 'concerns', 'path', 'risks', 'result', 'scheme', 'France']",2025-12-05,2025-12-06,voltairenet.org

Ukraine's war chest is expected to run dry in April  and leaders must decide whether to use sanctioned Kremlin cash to ensure Kyiv's survival or support the war effort with taxpayer money.U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff suggested that the same assets instead be used for American-led reconstruction efforts once a truce has been agreed.The U.S. would take “50 percent” of the profit from this activity  according to an initial 28-point peace plan  which was heavily criticized by Europeans for favoring Moscow and subsequently replaced by a rehashed plan — which doesn't appear to be gaining any traction with the Kremlin anyway.",neutral,0.01,0.72,0.26,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Ukrainian peace deal', 'Euroclear boss', 'initial 28-point peace plan', 'risky legal structure', 'U.S. envoy', 'American-led reconstruction efforts', 'The U.S.', '€165 billion reparations loan', 'Valérie Urbain', ""EU leaders' summit"", 'peace negotiations', 'state assets', 'bargaining chip', 'chief executive', 'Belgian broadcaster', 'European Commission', 'war chest', 'war effort', 'Steve Witkoff', 'same assets', 'Kremlin cash', 'taxpayer money', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Kyiv', 'Euroclear', 'stage', 'complex', 'leverage', 'talks', 'VRT', 'Friday', 'comments', 'Wednesday', 'Brussels', 'April', 'survival', 'truce', '50 percent', 'profit', 'activity', 'Europeans', 'Moscow', 'traction']",2025-12-05,2025-12-06,politico.eu

54058,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.voltairenet.org/article223293.html,What's behind the peace negotiations for Ukraine?  by Thierry Meyssan,We don't know what was said in Washington  but we can assume that the United States took a firm stance toward Ukraine  even if it didn't want to risk destroying Atlantic solidarity. Thierry Meyssan presents here what transpired during this tumultuous week.,"To understand the week of peace negotiations in Ukraine  it is essential to first dispel the misinformation disseminated by the mainstream press: contrary to what they implied  the Europeans were never allowed to join the Geneva talks.It is also worth recalling what I explained last week [1]: European governments have no interest in peace; they even fear it: it would undoubtedly bring about their own downfall.It is therefore no coincidence that the German  British  and French press claimed that the Geneva peace plan was a European document. They asserted this so strongly that we ourselves repeated this falsehood before correcting it.With that established  let us review the sequence of events:When the peace plan  drafted by the United States and Russia in Florida  became public [2]  the subservient commentators presented it as “outrageously pro-Russian.”The Geneva NegotiationsThe Ukrainians requested to draft a counter-proposal with the United States. Talks were held in Geneva on November 23 and 24.However  on November 22  EU leaders  along with the British  Norwegians  and Japanese  all attending the G20 summit of heads of state and government in Johannesburg  issued a joint statement. It reads:“We are ready to commit to ensuring that future peace is lasting. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force. We are also concerned about the proposed restrictions on the Ukrainian armed forces  which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.We reiterate that the implementation of elements relating to the European Union and those relating to NATO would require the consent of the respective EU and NATO members.”Germany  France  and the United Kingdom therefore sent diplomats—uninvited—to the Intercontinental Hotel where the US and Ukrainian delegations were staying. They were able to speak with both sides but were not admitted to the negotiations.The document  released after the talks  reiterates only the Ukrainian arguments [3].It no longer mentions the denazification of Ukraine  the country’s neutrality  or EU participation in its reconstruction. It is therefore unacceptable from a Russian perspective.Presenting his work to the press  State Secretary Marco Rubio simply stated that things were progressing very well. This is probably because Ukraine had renounced the reconquest of territories occupied/liberated by Russia and accepted their international recognition as Russian.The “Coalition of the Willing”On November 25  the Coalition of the Willing  established on March 1  2025  by General Petr Pavel  Czech President and former Chairman of NATO’s Military Committee  and by Keir Starmer  British Prime Minister  met via videoconference.The term “Coalition of the Willing” refers to President George Bush and his 2002 National Security Strategy. At the time  the aim was to bring together the allies (excluding Jacques Chirac’s France and Gerhard Schröder’s Germany) to invade Iraq. This coalition claimed to represent international law. To this end  the United Kingdom officially disseminated numerous pieces of fake news  which were later investigated by the Commission of Sir John Chilcot.The United Kingdom had similarly disseminated a large amount of fake news  secretly conducting drone flights over Belgian  Danish  Estonian  Norwegian  Polish  and Romanian airports. It had offered its own experts to the bewildered smaller nations and provided them with its own answers [4]. It had thus persuaded them that Russia was preparing to attack the European Union.It is worth recalling that at the NATO summit in Wales (2014)  the United Kingdom created a mini-NATO within NATO—the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). It comprised Denmark  Estonia  Finland  Iceland  Latvia  Lithuania  Norway  the Netherlands  and Sweden  under British command.This mini-NATO deployed Operation Nordic Warden when damage was reported to the Estlink2 undersea cable in the Baltic Sea.Not only did member states forget that it was the Ukrainians and/or the Americans who sabotaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines  but they also believed that the damage to these cables might have been caused by the Russians.On November 5  2025  the United Kingdom included Ukraine  a non-NATO member  in this Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF).The meeting of the “Coalition of the Willing” on November 25 was co-chaired by Emmanuel Macron (President of France)  Keir Starmer (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom)  and Friedrich Merz (Federal Chancellor of Germany). It is worth noting that while 38 states  NATO  and the EU participated  George Soros was represented by Radmila Šekerinska  the Macedonian Deputy Secretary General of NATO.President Macron outlined the approach  stating that all participants should remain “united to support a just  dignified  and lasting peace for Ukraine that would preserve its sovereignty and ensure its long-term security.” Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the importance of reliable security guarantees and strengthening Ukraine’s air defenses. London  which does not wish to engage in a confrontation with Russia  hopes to isolate it behind an “iron curtain ” as Winston Churchill did in his Fulton speech.Finally  Chancellor Merz welcomed the common position of the United States  Ukraine  and the European Union and stressed the need to negotiate with Russia.The volunteers listened to a report on the Geneva negotiations  in which only the United States participated.WiretapsOn November 25  the business news agency Bloomberg published a transcript of a phone conversation  recorded without their knowledge on October 14  between Steve Witkoff  Donald Trump’s special envoy  and Yuri Ushakov  the former Russian ambassador to Washington who had become Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic advisor. The Democratic-leaning news agency also published a transcript of another conversation  this time from October 29  between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev  Putin’s special envoy who represented him during the negotiations in Florida [«Putin advisers discuss plans for dealing with Trump:Transcript»  Bloomberg  November 25  2025. Version française de la première écoute : «L’intégralité de la conversation entre Steve Witkoff  envoyé spécial de Donald Trump  et Iouri Ouchakov  conseiller diplomatique de Vladimir Poutine  révélée par Bloomberg»  Le Monde  26 novembre 2025.]]. Kirill Dmitriev immediately called this second wiretap “fake.”The first call was a suggestion from Witkoff that President Putin should propose a 20-point plan modeled on President Trump’s plan for Gaza. The second implied that Russia had played a major role in the Florida peace plan.These two conversations  which had been intercepted by an intelligence service  were used to create the impression that the Florida plan had been drafted solely by Russia. However  anyone familiar with how such negotiations are conducted would be astonished by this. They in no way suggest that Witkoff was a Russian spy  but simply that he was doing his job.A simple reading of the plan reveals that it stipulates Russia will spend $100 billion to rebuild Ukraine and that it does not recognize the Odessa Oblast as Russian—even though this recognition would have allowed Transnistria’s request to leave Moldova and join the Russian Federation to be accepted.According to the Wall Street Journal  these wiretaps not only provide a distorted view of the negotiations  but they also miss the essential point. On August 7  Steve Witkoff reportedly informed the ""Coalition of the Willing"" that President Putin was prepared to relinquish Kherson and Zaporizhzhia if Ukraine recognized the annexation of all of Donbas (including the tiny portion still under Ukrainian control). Skeptical  the Europeans reportedly rejected these overtures  convinced that Russia intended to conquer all of Ukraine and then attack the European Union. [5]No one knows which intelligence agency carried out these wiretaps  more than a month before their publication  but our eyes naturally turn to the banks of the Thames. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan  President Vladimir Putin reiterated that  in his country  eavesdropping on telephone conversations is a criminal offense. [6]Belgium’s Refusal to Seize Frozen Russian MoneyOn November 27  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever and the clearing house Clearstream sent two letters to the European Commission. They firmly opposed the confiscation of $215 billion in frozen Russian deposits [7].Almost all experts believe that converting these frozen assets into “repair loans” would amount to seizure. Only British experts claim that equating this with theft is “nonsense.”It is true that  according to a study by the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI)  a defeat of Ukraine  with the resulting refugee migration  would be twice as costly for the European Union as maintaining the current situation [8].If nothing changes  Ukraine will default by the end of June at the latest.The Fall of the Ukrainian Presidential AdministrationOn November 28  while the White House was inviting unelected President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet with President-elect Donald Trump in Washington  the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU)—assisted by 80 U.S. inspectors seconded by the State Department—searched the home of Andriy Yermak  the all-powerful head of the presidential administration. Although the press had reported a search of Yermak’s offices  it was his home that investigators ransacked from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. They seized numerous cell phones.The defendant immediately resigned  thus avoiding censure by the Verkhovna Rada. He announced his decision in a letter to the New York Post [9]. In it  he wrote:“I have been defiled  and my dignity has not been protected  even though I have been in Kyiv since February 24  2022. Therefore  I do not want to create problems for Zelensky; I am going to the front lines… I am disgusted by the filth directed at me  and even more disgusted by the lack of support from those who know the truth.”Thus  on the one hand  Marco Rubio was meeting with Andriy Yermak in Geneva four days earlier  and on the other  investigators from his State Secretariat were removing Andriy Yermak from political life.Taking advantage of the war and Volodymyr Zelensky’s bipolar policies  Andriy Yermak  who was only the second-highest-ranking civilian official  had become the most powerful man in the country. According to investigators from the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU)  he was the one the corrupt officials called ""Ali Baba "" the man who coordinated all the bribes and embezzlement. While he is implicated in the theft of around one hundred million euros from energy contracts  he is believed to have actually stolen billions of euros from arms deals.Following many others  Yuriy Kamelchuk  a member of parliament from Zelensky’s party  is also reportedly on the run.Simultaneously  on November 28  Viktor Orbán  the Hungarian Prime Minister and a personal friend of both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump  visited the Kremlin  officially to discuss supplying his country with Russian hydrocarbons  but unofficially to continue contacts between Washington and Moscow. He was accompanied by Marcel Biro  his national security advisor  while President Putin was accompanied by Yury Ushakov  his diplomatic advisor whose conversation with Steve Witkoff had been monitored [10].Prime Minister Orbán’s trip to Moscow violated “European Union solidarity” but was in line with the special privilege granted to him by President Donald Trump to negotiate his country’s hydrocarbon supplies.Back to FloridaAccording to a decree issued by the unelected president  the Ukrainian delegation to participate in peace talks in Florida comprises nine people  including the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council  Rustem Umerov (who is currently a fugitive)  the head of Military Intelligence  General Kirill Budanov  the Deputy Chief of the SBU  General Oleksandr Poklad  and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  the staunch nationalist General Andriy Hnatov. It is not impossible  however  that Andriy Yermak will be part of the delegation  despite having resigned.Rustem Umarov  former head of Ukraine’s sovereign wealth fund  came to the United States just before the Florida negotiations. He met with FBI Director Kash Patel. Umarov is likely a CIA agent who served under MP Mustafa Abdülcemil Cemiloğlu (alias Mustafa Dzhemilev) [11]. He probably made a deal with the US justice system. He was the one who assured Steve Witkoff that Zelensky would accept the Florida plan. The fact that he is leading the Ukrainian delegation this weekend  even though he has already fled  seems to indicate that Washington holds all the cards.Final warm-upAt the time of writing  nothing has leaked from the Washington meeting. However  on November 30  Ursula von der Leyen  President of the European Commission  called Volodymyr Zelensky. She assured him that Ukraine must stand firm  despite the Russian army’s bombing of its energy facilities.Then Mark Rutte  NATO Secretary General  also called him. He seems to have been less enthusiastic and cautious about US support.Finally  French President Emmanuel Macron invited his unelected counterpart to visit him in Paris the following day  December 1st. He could only maintain the illusion. On November 17th  he had indeed pompously signed documents for the sale of 100 Rafale fighter jets  SAMP/T air defense systems  modern air defense radars  air-to-air missiles  and guided bombs to Ukraine.

Consequently  in the interests of the company  and in order to maintain operational and financial flexibility  in line with its strategic objectives  the Company intends to propose to the Bondholders a renegotiation of the terms of the Bonds  including  but not limited to  an amendment of the terms and conditions of the Bonds  and/or a possible extension of the term of the Bonds.Following these discussions  if applicable  all Bondholders could be convened  in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions  to vote on any amendment to the terms and conditions of the Bonds.***2024-25 IFRS Sales: 288 M€HEADCOUNTOver 1 300 employeesINTERNATIONAL36 subsidiaries and a distribution network in over 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben is a European player in video game publishing  in the design and distribution of mobile and gaming accessories  as well as audio-video products.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Part 1 (Phase I) is designed to characterize the preliminary safety  tolerability  and pharmacodynamic activity of increasing doses of ICT01 as monotherapy (Group A: solid tumors; Group B: hematologic tumors) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Group C: solid tumors). Part 2 comprises randomized dose-optimizing and efficacy estimating expansion cohorts of monotherapy (Group D: ovarian cancer; Group E: prostate cancer) and combination treatment of patients with AML (Group F)  melanoma (Group G)  urothelial cell carcinoma (Group H)  or head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (Group I). More information on the EVICTION study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04243499).About ICT01ICT01 is a humanized  anti-BTN3A (also known as CD277) monoclonal antibody that selectively activates γ9δ2 T cells  which are responsible for immunosurveillance of malignancy and infections. The three isoforms of BTN3A targeted by ICT01 are overexpressed on many solid tumors (e.g.  melanoma  urothelial cell  colorectal  ovarian  pancreatic  and lung cancer) and hematologic malignancies (e.g.  leukemia and lymphomas) and also expressed on the surface of innate (e.g.  γδ T cells and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells). BTN3A is essential for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response of γ9δ2 T cells.As demonstrated by data presented at past AACR  ASCO  ASH  ESMO and SITC conferences  ICT01 selectively activates circulating γ9δ2 T cells leading to migration of γ9δ2 T cells out of the circulation and into the tumor tissue and triggers a downstream immunological cascade through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines  including but not limited to IFNγ and TNFα  further augmenting the anti-tumor immune response. Anti-tumor activity and efficacy of ICT01 have been shown in patients across several cancer indications.About IMCHECK THERAPEUTICSImCheck Therapeutics is developing a new generation of immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting butyrophilins  a novel superfamily of immunomodulators. By unlocking the power of γ9δ2 T cells  ImCheck’s innovative approach has the potential to transform treatments across oncology  autoimmune  and infectious diseases.The lead clinical-stage program  ICT01  has been advancing to late-stage trials  demonstrating a unique mechanism of action that modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. These “first-in-class” activating antibodies may deliver superior clinical outcomes compared to first-generation immunotherapy approaches  in particular in rationale combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory anti-cancer drugs. Additionally  ImCheck’s pipeline compounds are progressing toward clinical development for autoimmune and infectious diseases.The company benefits from the pioneering research of Prof. Daniel Olive (INSERM  CNRS  Institut Paoli Calmettes  Aix-Marseille University)  a global leader in γ9δ2 T cells and butyrophilins  as well as the expertise of a seasoned management team and the commitment of leading U.S. and European investors. As announced on October 22  Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and ImCheck have entered into a definitive share purchase agreement in which Ipsen will acquire all issued and outstanding shares of ImCheck  with the transaction close anticipated by the end of Q1 2026.For further information: https://www.imchecktherapeutics.com/Press contacts:US and EUTrophic CommunicationsGretchen Schweitzer+49 (0) 172 861 8540imcheck@trophic.euFranceATCG PARTNERSCéline Voisin+33 (0)6 62 12 53 39imcheck@atcg-partners.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.19,0.31,0.5,True,English,"['ICT01 First-Line AML Data', '67th ASH Annual Meeting', 'Oral Presentation', 'ImCheck', 'open-label, randomized Phase I/II study', 'efficacy estimating expansion cohorts', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma', '67th ASH Annual Meeting', 'phase 1/2 study eviction', 'ICT01 First-Line AML Data', 'upcoming American Society', 'Acute Myeloid Leukemias', 'various advanced relapsed', 'preliminary safety, tolerability', 'urothelial cell carcinoma', 'CD277) monoclonal antibody', 'downstream immunological cascade', 'lead clinical-stage program', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'immunomodulatory anti-cancer drugs', 'Prof. Daniel Olive', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'care treatment options', 'superior clinical outcomes', 'several cancer indications', 'adaptive immune cells', 'first-generation immunotherapy approaches', 'many solid tumors', 'circulating γ9δ2 T cells', 'The ASH presentation', 'high remission rates', 'EVICTION Study', '2) clinical study', 'randomized dose-optimizing', 'high rates', 'Anti-tumor activity', 'adaptive immunity', 'γδ T cells', 'clinical development', 'refractory solid', 'hematologic tumors', 'ovarian cancer', 'prostate cancer', 'lung cancer', 'NK cells', 'B cells', 'overall survival', 'Abstract Title', 'Sylvain GRACIAZ', 'Investigational Drug', 'Cellular Therapies', 'chemotherapy combinations', 'Chapin Theater', 'corporate website', 'human, dose-escalation', 'hematologic cancers', 'pharmacodynamic activity', 'increasing doses', 'More information', 'clinicaltrials.gov', 'humanized, anti-BTN3A', 'three isoforms', 'colorectal, ovarian', 'hematologic malignancies', 'past AACR', 'SITC conferences', 'tumor tissue', 'pro-inflammatory cytokines', 'new generation', 'immunotherapeutic antibodies', 'novel superfamily', 'innovative approach', 'infectious diseases', 'late-stage trials', 'unique mechanism', 'activating antibodies', 'rationale combinations', 'pipeline compounds', 'pioneering research', 'Paoli Calmettes', 'Aix-Marseille University', 'global lea', 'Oral Presentation', 'combination treatment', 'Group B', 'Group C', 'Group D', 'Group E', 'Group F', 'Group G', '9δ2TC) activation', 'AML Room', 'ImCheck Therapeutics', 'γ9δ2 T-cell activator', 'France Session', 'Group A', 'unfit patients', 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes', '11:00 a', 'December', 'Hematology', 'place', 'Orlando', 'USA', 'class', 'azacitidine', 'venetoclax', 'older', 'Details', 'Aza-Ven', 'Results', 'Presenter', 'MD', 'PhD', 'OCCC', 'Date', 'Sunday', 'Time', 'Part', 'cohort-expansion', 'standard', 'monotherapy', 'pembrolizumab', 'melanoma', 'head', 'immunosurveillance', 'malignancy', 'infections', 'pancreatic', 'lymphomas', 'surface', 'innate', 'ASCO', 'ESMO', 'migration', 'circulation', 'secretion', 'IFNγ', 'TNFα', 'butyrophilins', 'immunomodulators', 'power', 'potential', 'treatments', 'oncology', 'autoimmune', 'action', 'company', 'INSERM', 'CNRS', '05:00', '5:15', '5:30']",2025-12-05,2025-12-06,globenewswire.com
