54070,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629100-hungary-blocks-eu-debt-plan-kiev/,Hungary blocks EU joint debt plan for Ukraine – Politico,Hungary has blocked the issuance of Eurobonds to arm Ukraine  Politico reports Read Full Article at RT.com,Prime Minister Viktor Orban previously argued against any further aid for Ukraine  urging Brussels to pursue diplomacy with RussiaHungary has blocked the issuance of Eurobonds to arm Ukraine – one of two options put forward by the European Commission to fund Kiev’s war effort – Politico reports  citing sources.After the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  EU states froze around €210 billion ($245 billion) in Russian central bank assets  most of them held by Belgian-based Euroclear.On Wednesday  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed two ways to finance Ukraine: EU-level borrowing through Eurobonds – an option criticized for its immediate impact on national treasuries – or a ‘reparations loan’ tied to the frozen Russian assets  which Moscow has called theft. The commission aims to reach a deal before a December 18 summit.According to Politico  Hungary formally ruled out the joint borrowing plan at Friday’s talks  reportedly leaving the bloc with only the ‘reparations loan’ as an option  since it only requires a qualified majority to be approved  while joint borrowing requires unanimous consent.Budapest has not confirmed whether it vetoed the move and has not commented on the report.Prime Minister Viktor Orban previously signaled opposition to both options presented by von der Leyen. He argued against further aid to Kiev  comparing it to trying to “help an alcoholic by sending them another crate of vodka ” while calling for diplomacy with Moscow instead of “burning” more money on Kiev’s war effort.The European Commission has downplayed the financial and legal risks associated with the loan and has claimed that its latest proposal addresses most concerns; many member states  however  oppose the idea.Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot warned that it could have “disastrous consequences” for his country  which would bear the brunt of Russian legal action.Euroclear  the custodian of the assets  also criticized the loan option on Friday  calling it unpredictable and “very fragile ” and warning that it could drive foreign investors out of the eurozone.“This initiative could have far-reaching legal  financial  and reputational risks for Euroclear  Belgium  the European Union and its financial markets” a Euroclear spokesperson told Euronews.,neutral,0.01,0.65,0.35,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,True,English,"['EU joint debt plan', 'Hungary', 'Ukraine', 'Politico', 'Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian central bank assets', 'many member states', 'Russian legal action', 'joint borrowing plan', 'The European Commission', 'foreign investors', 'Russian assets', 'EU states', 'legal risks', 'EU-level borrowing', 'European Union', 'war effort', 'two ways', 'immediate impact', 'national treasuries', 'December 18 summit', 'qualified majority', 'unanimous consent', 'latest proposal', 'most concerns', 'disastrous consequences', 'reputational risks', 'reparations loan', 'two options', 'Politico reports', 'Belgian-based Euroclear', 'financial markets', 'Euroclear spokesperson', 'Ukraine conflict', 'loan option', 'aid', 'Brussels', 'diplomacy', 'Hungary', 'issuance', 'Eurobonds', 'Kiev', 'sources', 'escalation', 'Wednesday', 'Moscow', 'deal', 'Friday', 'talks', 'bloc', 'Budapest', 'move', 'opposition', 'alcoholic', 'crate', 'vodka', 'money', 'idea', 'country', 'brunt', 'custodian', 'eurozone', 'initiative', 'reaching', 'Belgium', 'Euronews']",2025-12-06,2025-12-07,rt.com

De Wever fears that Russia will retaliate against Belgium at home and abroad  and is demanding ironclad financial guarantees from EU capitals before he even considers backing the Commission’s proposal.The Commission has repeatedly downplayed Belgium’s perceived legal risks but will need De Wever’s support before going ahead with the plan. Diplomats have already begun scouring the Commission’s legal text to appease the Belgians before EU leaders gather for a summit in Brussels on Dec. 18.A “plan B” to use joint debt to fund Ukraine also looks to be a no-go after Budapest nixed the move at an ambassadors’ meeting on Friday.Kyiv is set to run out of cash for its war effort early next year.,neutral,0.01,0.63,0.36,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Von der Leyen', 'Russian assets', 'Merz', 'Talks', 'Belgium', 'Brussels-based financial depository', 'frozen Russian assets', 'financial guarantees', 'German media', 'particular concern', 'conceivable solution', 'European states', 'same risk', 'De Wever', 'conclusive agreement', 'Belgian premier', 'EU capitals', 'legal risks', 'legal text', 'joint debt', 'ambassadors’ meeting', 'war effort', 'EU leaders', 'plan B', 'The Commission', 'Merz', 'sentiment', 'Belgium', 'question', 'use', 'way', 'comment', 'indication', 'lion', 'share', 'stewardship', 'Euroclear', 'ironclad', 'proposal', 'support', 'Diplomats', 'Belgians', 'summit', 'Dec.', 'Ukraine', 'go', 'Budapest', 'move', 'Friday', 'Kyiv', 'cash']",2025-12-06,2025-12-07,politico.eu
54073,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/infighting-division-slows-european-response-crunch-time-ukraine-war-rcna247599,Infighting and division slows European response at a 'crunch time' in Ukraine war,Europe faces “crunch time” on the war in Ukraine  a former European president said  as it battles internal division  Russian threats and U.S. hostility.,The U.S. has historically been Ukraine’s largest financial backer  but this support has waned  Trump says in his new National Security Strategy. Instead  he says European countries can buy American weapons to give to Ukraine.The broad policy for Europe should prioritize “reestablishing conditions of stability within Europe and strategic stability with Russia ” it says  adding that the U.S. should build up the “healthy nations of Central  Eastern  and Southern Europe through commercial ties  weapons sales  political collaboration  and cultural and educational exchanges.”“It’s clear that the United States is siding with Russia ” Ilves said. “I just saw a clip where Donald Trump is boasting  ‘Oh  they’re paying top dollar for our weapons ’” the Estonian added  paraphrasing the president’s remarks in the Oval Office from Wednesday. “We’re talking about people’s lives here  not just treating it like a commercial venture  that  ‘Oh  boy  we get to sell more weapons and get money for it.’ Morally  the situation is really abysmal ” he said.He was also particularly critical of the role played by Witkoff and Kushner  both noncareer diplomats  and the apparently limited involvement of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the State Department in dealing with Russia.“I think that when you have a real estate magnate and the son-in-law of the president doing the highest-level diplomacy and being bamboozled by Putin  it’s inevitable that countries where they still have professional diplomats will react that way ” he said of European nervousness.White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said Witkoff  Rubio and Kushner are “working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine” and held “productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable  enforceable peace.”“As President Trump has said  ‘it takes two to tango’ in order to bring the war to a close ” she added.After their Kremlin meeting  Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that he had spoken with Witkoff and Kushner  who said they had a “reasonably good meeting” with Putin.Though Europe has largely stepped up to fund Ukraine where Washington has withdrawn  the continent-wide cost-of-living crisis means they are reluctant to spend more of their own budgets. Hence the proposal this week to use Russian assets frozen at the start of the war.However  Belgium  where much of that money is held at Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial clearing house that holds the majority of Russia’s assets  is opposing this plan because it fears legal retaliation by Russia.“It makes a lot more sense to keep the assets where they are  and to keep using the profits that they generate ” said Sven Biscop  a director at the Egmont Institute  a Belgian think tank  who said he agreed with his government’s position.In resisting efforts against Russia  Belgium joins longtime E.U. contrarian Hungary  whose prime minister  Viktor Orbán  is a friend to both Trump and Putin.On Friday  German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen traveled to Belgium in an attempt to persuade its prime minister  Bart De Wever  to drop his opposition.“It feels like a last-ditch effort to try and unlock a much-needed source of financing ” said John Lough  an associate fellow at Chatham House  a London-based think tank. “Ukraine starts to run out of money in April next year. So there is some urgency here.”Meanwhile  French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday that there was “no mistrust” between the U.S. and Europe. “Unity between Americans and Europeans on the Ukrainian issue is essential. And I say it again and again  we ⁠need to work ‌together ” he said during a visit to China.Undeniable  however  were the contents of Trump’s National Security Strategy  which starkly laid out the most ardent criticisms of Europe voiced by Vice President JD Vance and others this year.The document accused the E.U. of undermining “political liberty and sovereignty ” of “transforming the continent” through migration  and of “creating strife” through political censorship. It said that declining birth rates had led to the “loss of national identities and self-confidence” and that “the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less.”It also said that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism ” an apparent reference to the continued rise of Europe’s far-right political parties  some of which  in the case of Austria’s Freedom Party  have Nazi roots or  as with Alternative for Germany  are considered “extremist” by the country’s own intelligence agencies.Through it all  Ilves  the former Estonian president  believes Europe can still play a vital role.“The European Union has not really shown any of its teeth or used any muscle so far ” he said. “We’re talking about the largest trading bloc in the world ” he added  calling any suggestions of irrelevance “absurd.”,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['European response', 'crunch time', 'Ukraine war', 'Infighting', 'division', 'White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'longtime E.U. contrarian Hungary', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Vice President JD Vance', 'new National Security Strategy', 'largest financial backer', 'patriotic European parties', 'The European Union', 'real estate magnate', 'durable, enforceable peace', 'Belgian think tank', 'Viktor Orbán', 'Bart De Wever', 'London-based think tank', 'declining birth rates', 'largest trading bloc', 'right political parties', 'former Estonian president', 'The U.S.', 'State Marco Rubio', 'Chatham House', 'European nervousness', 'national identities', 'European countries', 'State Department', 'President Trump', 'political collaboration', 'political liberty', 'political censorship', 'broad policy', 'reestablishing conditions', 'healthy nations', 'commercial ties', 'educational exchanges', 'United States', 'top dollar', 'Oval Office', 'commercial venture', 'noncareer diplomats', 'limited involvement', 'highest-level diplomacy', 'professional diplomats', 'productive meetings', 'Kremlin meeting', 'good meeting', 'continent-wide cost', 'living crisis', 'legal retaliation', 'Sven Biscop', 'Egmont Institute', 'prime minister', 'ditch effort', 'John Lough', 'associate fellow', 'Ukrainian issue', 'ardent criticisms', 'growing influence', 'great optimism', 'apparent reference', 'continued rise', 'Freedom Party', 'Nazi roots', 'intelligence agencies', 'American weapons', 'strategic stability', 'weapons sales', 'vital role', 'Donald Trump', 'Russian assets', 'Southern Europe', 'Ukraine', 'support', 'Central', 'Eastern', 'cultural', 'Ilves', 'clip', 'remarks', 'Wednesday', 'people', 'lives', 'money', 'situation', 'Witkoff', 'Kushner', 'son', 'law', 'Putin', 'killing', 'feedback', 'sides', 'plan', 'tango', 'order', 'war', 'reporters', 'Thursday', 'Washington', 'budgets', 'proposal', 'start', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'majority', 'sense', 'profits', 'director', 'government', 'position', 'efforts', 'friend', 'Friday', 'attempt', 'last', 'source', 'financing', 'April', 'urgency', 'mistrust', 'Unity', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'visit', 'China', 'contents', 'others', 'document', 'sovereignty', 'migration', 'strife', 'loss', 'self-confidence', '20 years', 'cause', 'case', 'Austria', 'Alternative', 'Germany', 'country', 'teeth', 'muscle', 'world', 'suggestions', 'irrelevance']",2025-12-06,2025-12-07,nbcnews.com

The total recovery of the economy from the adventure of the last decade with growth rates almost twice the European average and rapid reduction of public debtfueled the interest of foreign investors  upgrading the country’s position in the claiming of critical positions in the European structure and winning the praise of markets and international organizations.The new scene was reflected last week in three different but interdependent fields: a) In London  by the great interest shown by the international investment community in Greek banks at the Morgan Stanley and Hellenic Financial Services Conference; b) In Brussels  by the announcement of the two candidates for the presidency of the Eurogroup  one of whom is the Greek Minister of National Economy and Finance Kyriakos Pierrakakis and c) In Luxembourg  from the new green light given by the ESM for the early repayment of a €5.29 billion memorandum loan.The signals from LondonIn the first case  what is notable is that the interest in Greek banks at the London conference came mainly from large long-term investment funds. These are funds that a few years ago were not interested in investing in Greece. That is why dozens of meetings were held at the Morgan Stanley conference with the management and representatives of the major Greek banks. High on the agenda of the discussions were the forecasts for the course of key banking figures  which were considered particularly positive  alongside those for the Greek economy  according to circles involved in these contacts. According to the same players  a decisive factor in the launch of these developments is the acquisition of AXAE by Euronext.The European upgradeNever before had a Greek finance minister claimed the position of Eurogroup chairman. The negative tradition has been “broken” by Kyriakos Pierrakakis who is now  and with strong chances  claiming this position together with the vice-president of the Belgian government and budget minister Vincent van Petegem. The nomination of the Greek minister has received a very positive response from the international press  which has distinguished and highlighted the differences between the two candidacies. A “reformer profile” with an emphasis on digitisation  modernisation of the public sector and openness to innovation and investment was mentioned in reports in the European and British press. The common thread of the analyses in the European and British media is that the candidacy of Pierrakakis is the culmination of the upward trend of the Greek economy  with fiscal balance and rapid debt reduction as key features. The election of the new Eurogroup president will take place next Thursday  December 11.Debt repaymentGreece’s debt is expected to fall this year to 145.9% of GDP from 154.2% of GDP in 2024  to be further reduced to 138.2% in 2026  131.7% in 2027  124.6% in 2028  and 119% in 2029. This is a rapid decline that is foreseen in the Multiannual Fiscal Planning presented by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The continued deceleration of the public debt is due to the upward trend of the economy  as well as the early repayments of public debt  due to the high primary surpluses achieved in recent years. The green light for the new early repayment of memorandum debt was given last week by the ESM. This is a prepayment of the GFL loan that was part of Greece’s first financial support programme  agreed in May 2010. It consisted of bilateral loans totalling €52.9 billion provided by 14 eurozone member countries  of which €31.6 billion is still outstanding.
