Putin called the talks “necessary” and “useful” but rejected parts of the US proposal. Trump  however  said the negotiators left Moscow confident that both sides want to end the conflict.A Western European official cited by Bloomberg described the worst-case scenario as a full US withdrawal  the lifting of pressure on Russia  a ban on the use of US weapons by Ukraine  and an end to intelligence sharing.A less-damaging option would be the US stepping back from talks but still selling arms to NATO for onward transfer to Ukraine  while intelligence cooperation would be kept in place.The unease has been compounded by Trump’s release of a 33‑page National Security Strategy  which warned that Europe risked being “wiped away” unless it overhauled its politics and culture.The document accused Washington’s European partners of harboring “unrealistic expectations” regarding the conflict and displaying a “lack of self‑confidence” in dealing with Russia. It also stated that the US remains “open to structured diplomatic channels with Russia” wherever such engagement aligns with broader American interests.“The risk remains that the US walks away from the whole issue and leaves it up to the Europeans ” said John Foreman  former UK defense attaché to Moscow and Kiev.Earlier  Bloomberg reported that Witkoff had advised Russia on how to shape a peace proposal that Trump might find acceptable. In parallel  Macron reportedly warned that the US could “betray” Ukraine  while Merz was said to have accused Washington of “playing games.”The EU is exploring ways to use roughly €260 billion ($280 billion) in frozen Russian central bank assets held at Euroclear  but efforts remain stalled. Belgium has demanded strong safeguards  while Hungary has blocked earlier funding plans.Washington opposes fully seizing the assets and prefers using only the generated profits  slowing agreement further.
