Belgium  where most of the money is held by the Euroclear clearinghouse  has refused to greenlight the proposal unless other nations agree to share associated legal and financial risks.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has said broader international backing  particularly from non-EU countries holding Russian assets  would bolster the European Commission’s case for what he called the effective confiscation of a foreign state’s funds. But at a meeting of G7 finance ministers on Monday  Japan’s Satsuki Katayama made clear her government would not support the plan due to legal constraints  Politico reported  citing EU diplomatic sources.Officials told the outlet they believe Japan’s stance aligns with that of the United States  which also opposes the EU approach and views the frozen assets as leverage in negotiations with Moscow.France has reportedly likewise declined to touch any assets held on its soil  while Canada and the UK have signaled possible participation if the EU ultimately pursues the scheme.Ukraine’s parliament last week adopted a 2026 budget with a staggering $47.5 billion deficit  expecting foreign donors and creditors to fill the gap. Roughly half that anticipated support – an estimated $23.6 billion – remains uncertain pending the fate of the EU loan plan.Ukrainian media noted that lawmakers pushed the budget through despite unresolved questions over foreign financing  in part to project stability following the removal of Andrey Yermak  formerly the most powerful aide to the country’s leader  Vladimir Zelensky.

Belgium has so far pushed back against EU pressure to use the assets to fund Ukraine  warning of legal risks.However  given that Ukraine’s budget hole is projected to reach $48 billion next year  EU officials are reportedly pressing to tap the funds.Moscow has long condemned any attempt to use the assets as theft and warned of retaliation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has admitted that the money could allow Kiev’s Western sponsors to temporarily sustain Ukraine’s flagging battlefield efforts.“This money would  in principle  be enough for them to expend Ukrainians like bullets for a couple more years ” he said on Sunday.,negative,0.0,0.31,0.69,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['false’ Russian assets claim', 'Japan', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian clearing house Euroclear', 'The Japanese Finance Ministry', 'Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Vice Finance Minister', 'major borrowing push', 'flagging battlefield efforts', 'Minister Katayama', 'Russian reserves', 'Russian funds', 'EU plan', 'International Affairs', 'specific steps', 'EU members', 'immobilized reserves', 'EU pressure', 'legal risks', 'budget hole', 'EU officials', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Western sponsors', 'Atsushi Mimura', 'reparations loan', 'Tokyo', 'Ukraine', 'Politico', 'reporting', 'bloc', 'proposal', 'Kiev', 'reporters', 'Tuesday', 'Reuters', 'comment', 'meeting', 'tune', 'bulk', 'Moscow', 'Belgium', 'attempt', 'theft', 'retaliation', 'money', 'principle', 'Ukrainians', 'bullets', 'couple', 'years', 'Sunday']",2025-12-09,2025-12-10,rt.com

In recent weeks  its stance has hardened amid a concerted PR push to isolate Brussels' government and portray it as “pro-Russian.”Western governments  including Germany  France  and Britain  are trying to broker a compromise with Brussels in what The Economist has called a “cage fight.”According to the outlet the EU has identified a treaty provision that could keep frozen Russian assets in place indefinitely  sidestepping the six-month rollovers that require unanimity. However  pushing ahead without Belgium’s backing risks a “deep internal split.”Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever fears that Belgium could end up “on the hook” for the €185 billion in frozen Russian assets held at Belgian-based  but privately owned  Euroclear  if Moscow seeks to recover the money once sanctions are lifted  the report said.For now  cash-strapped bloc members must keep drawing on their own budgets  writing checks totaling hundreds of millions of euros. Northern European countries that have provided a disproportionate share of the aid are increasingly frustrated that the burden is not being shared more evenly across the bloc.The loan scheme has been criticized by several EU states  including major holders of Russian assets such as France  Luxembourg  and Germany  while Italy  Hungary  and Slovakia also oppose any seizure  the report said.The US is “actively lobbying” against the plan  arguing the assets’ return should be used as a “carrot” in Ukraine peace talks.

As of December 2  the countries had already allocated $34.8 billion to Ukraine under this arrangement  Sputnik estimated. The European Commission is seeking to get EU countries to use the Russian Central Bank's assets to finance Ukraine's war effort. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around $163 billion in Russian money could be used as a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine would only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage"" from Russia. Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $349 billion.

plan,EU reassurances over its plan to use frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine have failed to quell worries about the untested scheme  the organisation holding most of the funds told AFP. “We’ve made very  very clear that we still have concerns ” Guillaume E…,Belgium-based Euroclear holds the vast bulk of Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU - Copyright AFP Nicolas TUCATMax DELANYEU reassurances over its plan to use frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine have failed to quell worries about the untested scheme  the organisation holding most of the funds told AFP.“We’ve made very  very clear that we still have concerns ” Guillaume Eliet  chief risk officer at Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear  told AFP in an interview.The European Commission is pushing to tap some 200 billion euros ($232 billion) of Russian central bank assets immobilised in the bloc to provide a desperately needed loan for Kyiv.Officials are desperate to get agreement on an initial 90 billion euros to prop up Ukraine’s finances at an EU leaders’ summit on December 18.But the complex plan — under which Euroclear loans the money to the European Union  which in turn loans it to Kyiv — faces resistance from Belgium over fears of potential financial and legal reprisals from Moscow.The EU’s executive has insisted it would put a “three-tier defence” in place that would mean there is “no scenario” under which Euroclear would not be able to get the money to repay Russia if needed.Under that system the EU says member states can provide guarantees that they will help cover any liabilities.But Eliet said Euroclear — a key cog in Europe’s financial machinery processing equities  bonds  derivative and investment fund transfers — still needs convincing that those promises mean it could get the funds immediately if required.“We need to make sure that in a very short timeframe we can access the liquidity ” he said in the interview Monday.“How can we be reassured that if we need the money on Monday morning we can call out these guarantees?”Euroclear still holds some 16 billion euros of client assets in Russia that it worries Moscow could seize in retribution — and it would have to compensate.While guarantees from EU states were a positive step  Eliet insisted it was unclear how binding they would be if there were political changes in those countries.“Are we sure that in 10 years down the road we would still be protected?” he said.– ‘Doable’ –A further concern is that the move could be seen as confiscating Russian assets  something the commission insists is not the case.The company — which has over 40 trillion euros under custody — also frets that it would knock confidence in the broader eurozone economy.“The setup as it’s presented today may still be considered  especially by international investors  a signal that maybe Europe is not a safe place to invest in ” Eliet said.As the clock ticks down to the crunch EU summit next week  Eliet said finding a solution was possible  but lawyers needed to “sit down around the table” and hammer out a plan to “reduce or avoid the risks”.“We are happy to sit around the table as well to produce the best framework possible within the short timeframe we have — it is doable.”In a bid to spread the risk around  Belgium has called on the EU to look to use some 25 billion euros in Russian assets held outside Euroclear.The commission has said it wants to do that  but EU countries where the funds are stashed have not come forward.“What we understand is that the preference of the EU would be to go to Euroclear first ” Eliet said.As Russia ratchets up warnings over the plan  Euroclear has stepped up its security measures and is “monitoring the level of threats on a daily basis”.“We are putting in place everything we can to protect our people ” Eliet said.With other EU states including powerhouse Germany pushing hard for the plan  Belgium’s fierce objections could be overridden.There appears little appetite for a fallback plan for the EU to raise the loan itself  which Euroclear still prefers.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said the loan scheme only needs a weighted majority of countries — a step Euroclear says would be unwise.“It is really in the interest of Europe that the member states go together for a solution ” Eliet

(AP Photo/Harry Nakos)BRUSSELS -- Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine  European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years  one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.At a summit next week  the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements  which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).Such a move has never been done before  and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money  it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.Belgium  where most of the assets are held  is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back  either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so  but those responsible were never publicly identified.European Council President Antonio Costa  who will chair the Dec. 18 summit  has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.EU leaders froze the money  most of it in Russian Central Bank assets  over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”Two plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.Plan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets  much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.Many of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.The assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.The European Commission  the EU’s executive branch  estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.There are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets  only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all  meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.Over the last year  Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.Avoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.Unveiling her plan on Dec. 4  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027  for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.Due to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets  cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year  Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.Under the new plan  some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.The commission insists that there is no “theft ” as Russia has claimed  because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.Once Putin pays war reparations  Ukraine would repay the EU  the EU would repay Euroclear  and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.Importantly for Belgium  the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.But the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public  Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic  financial and legal risks.”Prévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return ” he said.In an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week  Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.,neutral,0.06,0.88,0.06,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['European leaders', 'Russian assets', 'major test', 'Ukraine', '2 years', 'next two years European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'three to five years', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'European Union leaders', 'stridently nationalist leader', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Belgian financial clearinghouse', 'massive loan plan', 'Seven loan plan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Two plans', 'EU debt instrument', 'European economies', ""other countries' money"", 'International partners', 'frozen assets', 'financial markets', 'reparations loan', 'media conference', 'AP Photo', 'Harry Nakos', 'euro currency', 'member nations', 'main opponent', 'nefarious ways', 'drone incidents', 'military bases', 'Plan B', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'major economies', 'existential threat', 'Intelligence assessments', 'substantial pot', 'executive branch', '210 billion ($244 billion', 'vast majority', 'political advantages', 'qualified majority', 'green light', 'last year', 'Czech Republic', 'member countries', '27 EU leaders', 'military needs', 'financing needs', '135 billion euros', '193 billion euros', '90 billion euros', '3.9 billion euros', 'EU headquarters', 'EU support', 'two-thirds majority', 'new plan', 'full-scale war', 'cash balances', 'EU sanctions', 'war reparations', 'Dec. 18 summit', 'Ukraine', 'economic', 'Brussels', 'Wednesday', 'Kyiv', 'tens', 'billions', 'dollars', 'requirements', 'move', 'risks', 'Europeans', 'confidence', 'retaliation', 'Belgium', 'courts', 'series', 'airports', 'Kremlin', 'decision', 'February', 'Moscow', 'scheme', 'damage', 'bloc', 'end', 'September', 'Euroclear', 'Borrowing', 'single', 'vote', 'idea', 'Hungary', 'turn', 'government', 'Slovakia', 'heels', 'veto', 'interest', 'total', 'gap', 'Group', 'theft', 'right', 'claim', 'duty']",2025-12-09,2025-12-10,abcnews.go.com

The new company will include the Vermont-based brand.Magnum  a longtime division of the consumer goods giant  announced last month that Mittal “no longer meets the criteria” to serve following internal investigations  though it offered no further details. The division will list publicly on Euronext  inheriting a bitter corporate feud between Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s over the brand’s political stance on Israel.An audit of the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation  a US non-profit where Mittal has served as trustee since 2012  cited deficiencies in financial controls and governance. Mittal  chair of the independent board since 2018  rejected the findings outright.“The so-called audit of the foundation was a manufactured inquiry - engineered to attempt to discredit me ” she said  as quoted by Reuters. “It is important to understand that this is not simply an attack on me as chair. It is Unilever’s attempt to undermine the authority of the Board itself.”Mittal insisted she is fulfilling her responsibilities under the 2000 merger agreement with Unilever  safeguarding both the brand’s social mission and product quality.Magnum countered: “This is not about individuals  it is about the consistent application of good governance principles and practices across The Magnum Ice Cream Company.” The company said the audit was conducted in preparation for its demerger.Unilever did not respond to requests for comment.Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s have been at odds since 2021  when the Vermont-based brand announced it would halt sales in Judea and Samaria.At the time  Mittal denied that the company’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Judea and Samaria was antisemitic  writing  “I am proud of Ben & Jerry’s for taking a stance to end sale of its ice cream in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”Later that year  Mittal was voted ""Antisemite of the Year"" by watchdog StopAntisemitism  which cited Mittal being the driving force behind the decision by Ben & Jerry's to stop selling its products in Judea and Samaria.In January of this year  Ben & Jerry's initiated legal action against Unilever  alleging attempts to silence its outspoken stance on Gaza and its past criticisms of President Donald Trump.",negative,0.05,0.44,0.51,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,True,English,"['Ben', 'Jerry', 'chair', 'Unilever', 'intention', 'The Magnum Ice Cream Company', 'Magnum ice cream division', 'consumer goods giant', 'bitter corporate feud', 'Occupied Palestinian Territory', 'President Donald Trump', 'good governance principles', 'longtime division', 'new company', 'mounting pressure', 'internal investigations', 'US non-profit', 'financial controls', '2000 merger agreement', 'social mission', 'product quality', 'consistent application', 'watchdog StopAntisemitism', 'driving force', 'legal action', 'past criticisms', 'independent board', 'political stance', 'outspoken stance', 'Vermont-based brand', 'Anuradha Mittal', 'chair', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'intention', 'Unilever', 'Monday', 'Reuters', 'criteria', 'details', 'Euronext', 'Israel', 'audit', 'Foundation', 'trustee', 'deficiencies', 'findings', 'inquiry', 'attack', 'attempt', 'authority', 'responsibilities', 'individuals', 'practices', 'preparation', 'demerger', 'requests', 'comment', 'odds', 'sales', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'decision', 'Year', 'products', 'January', 'Gaza']",2025-12-09,2025-12-10,israelnationalnews.com

With direct access to the French road ‘Nationale 4’  Tournan-en-Brie is a historic logistics hub in the eastern Paris region and one of the birthplaces of ARGAN’s development  which is also present in the neighboring Châtres logistics area.An AutOnom® building combined with a rail connection: the winning formula for environmentally friendly operationsThe warehouse  with a total surface area of 30 000 sq.m  will consist of four large storage units of 7 200 sq.m each. In line with ARGAN’s strategy for energy efficiency  the site will be equipped with the AutOnom® solution  enabling the warehouse to produce its own energy. A 400 kWp photovoltaic plant dedicated to JUNG LOGISTIQUE’s self-consumption will be installed on the roof  complemented by 300 kWh of battery storage. This setup will significantly reduce the building’s energy footprint and ensure optimized self-consumption  in line with ARGAN’s commitments to more sustainable and resilient logistics. The building’s expected residual CO₂ emissions will be less than 1 kg/sq.m/year.Direct access to the site’s rail network was also a decisive factor in JUNG LOGISTIQUE’s decision to choose the AutOnom® facility in Tournan-en-Brie. Indeed  the majority of freight flows will be handled by rail. The use of a low-carbon mode of transport further enhances the sustainable nature of this partnership between ARGAN and JUNG LOGISTIQUE.Ronan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “We are pleased to support JUNG LOGISTIQUE in this new phase of its development and to strengthen our presence in Tournan-en-Brie. This project reflects our commitment to offering next-generation buildings that combine operational performance with environmental excellence.”2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 5: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2025quarter 2025 January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The completion of this clinical trial will require limited additional financial resources from OSE and ongoing investigator-led Phase 2 studies could also add additional proof-of-concept data at minimal cost. Develop Lusvertikimab Intravenous (IV) in One or Two New Rare/Specialty Indications: Use existing intravenous (IV) formulation to target one or two new rare or specialty diseases with high unmet medical needs  and with a precision medicine approach. These clinical developments will require more modest financial investment than further development in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and will expand the asset’s potential to treat multiple immune-mediated conditions  with a faster route to market. Indications and clinical development plans are being refined and will be disclosed in early 2026. Lusvertikimab Subcutaneous (SC) in Ulcerative Colitis (UC): While great Phase 2 clinical data were generated with Lusvertikimab intravenous formulation  the overall UC market is almost entirely focused on more convenient oral and sub-cutaneous formulations. OSE has therefore decided to pivot the UC indication to a subcutaneous formulation of Lusvertikimab and aims to partner this asset once bioequivalence data have been generated. Additional scientific evidence will be generated on the biomarker that seems predictive of a strong clinical response in approximately 25% of patients tested in the Lusvertikimab IV Phase 2 CoTikiS study. Confirming these early findings would position Lusvertikimab SC in Ulcerative Colitis as a game changer in the treatment of this disease  allowing well over 30% of treated patients to achieve clinical remission  and significantly enhance the attractiveness of this asset for potential partners. Maintain Scientific Leadership: Leverage OSE Immunotherapeutics’ differentiated research engine to fuel innovation for rare and large indications and explore combination strategies for Lusvertikimab. Optimize Intellectual Property management with best-in-class processes for agility  cost efficiency  and maximum value creation.Advancing one or two specialty indications and a subcutaneous formulation for Lusvertikimab strengthens its value proposition and opens new business opportunities. This strategy is supported by disciplined financial management and scientific leadership — securing financing aligned with strategic goals  optimizing capital structure  and leveraging partnerships and milestone payments  while showcasing OSE Immunotherapeutics’ expertise and differentiated mechanisms of action.Marc Le Bozec  Chief Executive Officer at OSE Immunotherapeutics commented:“This strategy positions OSE for success by concentrating resources where they can create the most value for all our stakeholders over the next three years. It’s ambitious yet realistic for a company our size.“We’ve reached an inflection point where we focus on programs with the greatest potential for near-term catalysts and return  while preparing to partner assets that require larger scale once they are Phase 3-ready. Our plan strikes the right balance between clinical risk and financial opportunity  prioritizing late-stage assets and keeping our research engine strong. It reflects our vision and the exceptional dedication of our teams  which is the foundation of OSE’s ability to deliver on these goals.”Financial Visibility and StrategyOSE Immunotherapeutics enters this strategic cycle with an ambition to limit shareholder dilution while securing a reasonable cash runway through a mix of complementary financing options  including equity  new debt and restructuring of existing debt. The Company currently has financial visibility until early Q4 2026  excluding any additional financing or milestone payments from existing partnerships. While the three-year strategic plan requires far less investment than the previously planned Phase 2b for Lusvertikimab IV in ulcerative colitis  additional financial resources will be necessary to complete it.In parallel  OSE Immunotherapeutics will continue to investigate new strategic partnerships on its proprietary assets and may also be eligible to receive milestones under current agreements  notably a EUR 17.5m payment from Boehringer Ingelheim  related to the 2024 acquisition of a cis-targeting anti-PD-1/cytokine asset  which would significantly reduce financing needs.Beyond these priorities  other proprietary assets will advance in preclinical development at limited cost to maximize partnership opportunities.A Webcast will take place on Wednesday  December 10th  2025  at 18:00 CET / noon ET to discuss this Strategic Plan and answer Shareholder questions.Register here for the French version and here for the English version.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.
