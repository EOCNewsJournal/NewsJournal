One of its key points is a long-debated ‘reparations loan’ backed by the frozen Russian assets that would require financial institutions holding the assets to transfer them to a new loan instrument.The EU is also reportedly pushing to decouple the asset freeze from the bloc’s sanctions on Russia and make it indefinite  in an effort to prevent opposition from Hungary. Currently  both measures require regular renewals by unanimous decision.Russia will retaliate against any expropriation of its assets and has already prepared a response  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday. Kiev’s Western backers have no more money left for funding the Ukraine conflict other than “robbing” Russia  he argued.,negative,0.01,0.46,0.54,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['Russian money', 'Belgian PM', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'next two years', 'Russian central bank', 'new loan instrument', 'Belgian opposition', 'Russian assets', 'illegal seizure', 'qualified majority', 'biggest legal', 'financial risks', 'legal action', 'great risks', 'key points', 'reparations loan', 'financial institutions', 'asset freeze', 'regular renewals', 'Western backers', 'Russian money', 'EU members', 'The EU', 'VRT news', 'unanimous decision', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU proposal', 'bloc', 'country', 'latest', 'unwise', 'Wednesday', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'solutions', 'war', 'embassy', 'furniture', 'odds', 'legality', 'sanctions', 'effort', 'Hungary', 'measures', 'expropriation', 'response', 'Kiev']",2025-12-10,2025-12-11,rt.com

The bloc hopes to use the funds to back a so-called “reparation loan” to Kiev – a plan that the Kremlin has denounced as outright theft.Orban has argued against further aid to Kiev  comparing it to trying to “help an alcoholic by sending them another crate of vodka ” while calling for diplomacy with Russia instead of “burning” more money on Ukraine’s war effort. Earlier this month  Budapest reportedly vetoed the issuance of Eurobonds to arm Kiev – another option put forward by the European Commission to continue financing the conflict.According to the FT  EU officials have proposed invoking emergency powers to permanently freeze up to €210 billion ($245 billion) in sovereign Russian assets. Making the freeze indefinite would decouple it from regular sanction renewals  preventing Budapest from blocking the measure.Diplomats reportedly believe that adopting the indefinite freeze within days would strengthen the EU’s position when discussing the proposed “reparation loan.” The matter is set to be on the agenda at the upcoming summit of EU leaders later this week.After the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  EU states froze a large number of Russian central bank assets  mostly held by Brussels-based Euroclear. Hungary is not alone in opposing the plan to use the funds to back a loan for Ukraine. Belgium has said the initiative carries financial and legal risks  while France  Luxembourg  Germany  Italy  and Slovakia have also reportedly spoken against the move.On Wednesday  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov argued that “robbing” Moscow “in violation of all established norms of international and commercial law” is the last remaining option for Brussels to sustain Kiev in its conflict with Moscow.,neutral,0.0,0.73,0.26,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Russian assets plan', 'EU', 'Orban', 'FT', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian central bank assets', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'regular sanction renewals', 'last remaining option', 'upcoming EU summit', 'upcoming summit', 'unanimous approval', 'outright theft', 'European Commission', 'emergency powers', 'large number', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'legal risks', 'commercial law', 'EU leaders', 'EU states', 'asset freeze', 'reparation loan', 'indefinite freeze', 'Financial Times', 'war effort', 'EU officials', 'Ukraine conflict', 'legislation', 'Hungary', 'veto', 'order', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'measure', 'plans', 'part', 'sanctions', 'response', 'bloc', 'Kiev', 'Kremlin', 'aid', 'alcoholic', 'crate', 'vodka', 'diplomacy', 'money', 'Budapest', 'issuance', 'Eurobonds', 'Diplomats', 'days', 'position', 'matter', 'agenda', 'escalation', 'Belgium', 'initiative', 'France', 'Luxembourg', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Slovakia', 'move', 'Wednesday', 'violation', 'norms', 'international']",2025-12-10,2025-12-11,rt.com

The European Commission is seeking to get EU countries to use the Russian Central Bank's assets to finance Ukraine's war effort. On November 8  Belgian news agency Belga reported that around $163 billion in Russian money could be used as a so-called reparations loan  which Ukraine would only repay if it receives ""compensation for material damage"" from Russia. Belgium opposes the plan over fears of legal consequences. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $349 billion.

Russia is ready to respond to any hostile Western actions  he warned.Brussels is pushing a “reparations loan” scheme that would use frozen Russian funds in Western jurisdictions as collateral to prop up Ukraine’s imploding economy and extend its ability to continue fighting amid months of frontline setbacks. Moscow has repeatedly called the plan illegal.“Europe is blinded by its desire to impose a ‘strategic defeat’ on Russia. They cannot imagine – and some officials openly admit that in interviews – a situation in which they are forced to ‘swallow’ that their client has been defeated and that Russia will accomplish its legitimate objectives ” Lavrov said in an address to the Federation Council  the upper chamber of the Russian parliament.According to the top diplomat  European countries’ “ideological” anti-Russian drive is colliding with economic reality  since “they have no other sources to finance this war unless they rob the Russian Federation and take our foreign assets in violation of all established norms of international and commercial law.”Lavrov described the EU’s stance as “destructive” and cautioned that Moscow “will retaliate against any hostile steps  including the possible deployment of European military units in Ukraine or the expropriation of Russian assets.”The EU’s intention to finance Kiev’s war effort – pushed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – has been blocked by Belgium  which holds the bulk of immobilized Russian assets through the clearing house Euroclear.The Belgian government said the proposed loan would expose it to significant legal and financial risks  which must be shared collectively by all EU members. It also urged non-EU nations that hold Russian assets to make their own contributions.Lavrov noted that European officials “have created problems for themselves” with their lack of flexibility  stressing that the United States  the key security provider for Western Europe  is growing impatient with them and the Ukrainian leadership.,negative,0.01,0.5,0.5,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Ukraine conflict', 'Robbing', 'Russia', 'option', 'West', 'Lavrov', 'European countries’ “ideological” anti-Russian drive', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'last remaining option', 'desperate European backers', 'European military units', 'key security provider', 'frozen Russian funds', 'reparations loan” scheme', 'hostile Western actions', 'European Commission', 'hostile actions', 'European officials', 'foreign assets', 'Western jurisdictions', 'hostile steps', 'Russian parliament', 'Russian Federation', 'imploding economy', 'frontline setbacks', 'strategic defeat', 'legitimate objectives', 'Federation Council', 'upper chamber', 'top diplomat', 'economic reality', 'other sources', 'commercial law', 'possible deployment', 'clearing house', 'Belgian government', 'significant legal', 'financial risks', 'non-EU nations', 'United States', 'Ukrainian leadership', 'Russian assets', 'Western Europe', 'war effort', 'EU members', 'Moscow', 'expropriation', 'Ukraine', 'Kiev', 'conflict', 'Wednesday', 'Brussels', 'collateral', 'ability', 'months', 'plan', 'desire', 'interviews', 'situation', 'client', 'address', 'violation', 'norms', 'international', 'stance', 'intention', 'President', 'Belgium', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'contributions', 'problems', 'lack', 'flexibility']",2025-12-10,2025-12-11,rt.com

As things stand  Kyiv's war chest will run bare in April. Failure to use the Russian assets to finance the loan would force EU capitals to reach into their own pockets to keep Ukraine afloat. But frugal countries are politically opposed to shifting the burden to EU taxpayers.Belgium is the main holdout over financing Ukraine using the Russian assets  amid fears that it will be on the hook to repay the full amount if Moscow manages to claw its money back.The bulk of this revenue is currently being funneled to Ukraine to pay down a €45 billion loan from G7 countries  with Euroclear retaining a 10 percent buffer to cover legal risks. | Artur Widak/Getty ImagesIn its list of suggested changes  Belgium asked the EU to set aside an unspecified amount of money to protect Euroclear from the risk of Russian retaliation. It said that the safety net will account for ""increased costs which Euroclear might suffer (e.g. legal costs to defend against retaliation)"" and compensate for lost revenue.According to the document  the extra cash buffer should be financed by the windfall profits that Euroclear collects in interest from a deposit account at the European Central Bank  where the Kremlin-sanctioned money is currently sitting. The proceeds amounted to €4 billion last year.The bulk of this revenue is currently being funneled to Ukraine to pay down a €45 billion loan from G7 countries  with Euroclear retaining a 10 percent buffer to cover legal risks.

That's key for the Italians and French  as EU leaders prepare to discuss the initiative at a summit next week. Failure to secure a deal could leave Ukraine without enough funds to keep Russian forces at bay next year.The Commission has suggested all EU countries share the risk by providing financial guarantees against the loan in case the Kremlin manages to claw back its sanctioned cash  which is held in the Brussels-based financial depository Euroclear.“None of the conditions” that would lead to EU liability being transferred to member states ""would be met "" Eurostat wrote in a letter  adding that the chances of EU countries ever paying those guarantees are weak. The Commission instead will be held liable for those guarantees  the agency added.Germany is set to bear the brunt of the loan  guaranteeing some €52 billion under the Commission's draft rules. This figure will likely rise as Hungary has already refused to take part in the funding drive for Ukraine. The letter is unlikely to change Belgium's stance  as it wants much higher guarantees and greater legal safeguards against Russian retaliation at home and abroad.The biggest risk facing the Commission's proposal is the prospect of the assets being unfrozen if pro-Russia countries refuse to keep existing sanctions in place.Under current rules  the EU must unanimously reauthorize the sanctions every six months. That means Kremlin-friendly countries  such as Hungary and Slovakia  can force the EU to release the sanctioned money with a simple no vote.To make this scenario more unlikely  the Commission suggested a controversial legal fix that will be discussed today by EU ambassadors.

The move underscores deepening divisions among Western allies over how to handle Russia's immobilized funds – estimated at $300 billion – as Ukraine's financial crisis worsens.The European Commission has been pushing for a ""reparations loan"" backed by Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions  primarily held in Belgium's Euroclear clearinghouse. The goal is to provide Ukraine with immediate funding while theoretically holding Russia liable for war reparations.However  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has insisted that broader international participation is necessary to mitigate legal and financial risks. One EU diplomat told POLITICO that ""Belgium is resisting over fears it will be on the hook to repay the full amount if Russia claws back the money.""Despite Brussels' urgency – hoping to finalize a deal before an EU leaders' summit on Dec. 18 – Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama reportedly ruled out Tokyo's involvement  citing legal hurdles.""Katayama never made such a comment [in the G7 meeting]. She told the meeting that Japan in preparing to make specific steps to support [Ukraine] "" disputed Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Atsushi Mimura.""It's completely false. Japan has acted for Ukraine from our national interest "" Mimura told reporters on Tuesday  Dec. 9  in response to the POLITICO report. However  sources suggest Tokyo's stance aligns with Washington's reluctance to endorse the EU’s approach.U.S. opposition and alternative plansThe Trump administration has opposed outright confiscation of Russian assets  viewing them as leverage in future negotiations with Moscow. Instead  Washington has floated a compromise: returning a portion of the funds to Russia while using the remainder to finance U.S. investments in Ukraine.""Our Reparations Loan proposal is complex  but at its core  it increases the cost of war for Russia "" declared European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Yet  without U.S. and Japanese backing  the EU may be forced to shoulder Ukraine's financial burden alone.According to the Enoch engine at BrightU.AI  the EU's proposal for Ukraine to receive a reparations loan has sparked considerable debate and scrutiny. This proposal  aimed at compensating Ukraine for the damages incurred due to Russia's invasion  is a complex financial and political instrument with multiple objectives and implications. While the EU's reparations loan proposal for Ukraine has been generally welcomed  it has also faced criticisms and concerns.Kyiv faces a staggering $47.5 billion budget deficit in 2026  with nearly half – $23.6 billion – dependent on uncertain foreign aid. Ukrainian lawmakers hastily approved the budget last week despite unresolved funding questions  likely aiming to project stability amid political turmoil following the dismissal of Andrey Yermak  a key aide to Zelensky embroiled in corruption scandals.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged EU nations to share Belgium's risks. Meanwhile  the United Kingdom and Canada have signaled conditional support –but only if Brussels proceeds first.Beyond Ukraine's immediate needs  the debate over Russian assets carries profound implications for global finance. Russian President Vladimir Putin  in an interview with Tucker Carlson  warned that seizing Russian reserves – largely denominated in U.S. dollars – would be ""insanely stupid "" eroding trust in Western financial systems. Analysts fear that if the G7 proceeds with confiscation  nations worldwide may accelerate moves away from dollar-denominated reserves  favoring alternatives like BRICS currencies (Chinese yuan  Indian rupee and Russian ruble).Japan's rejection of the EU's asset-seizure plan highlights the West's growing disunity over Ukraine funding. With the U.S. prioritizing strategic leverage over immediate financial aid  and Brussels struggling to secure international backing  Ukraine's fiscal crisis looms larger than ever.Watch EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas saying Russia will not regain frozen assets without paying reparations to Ukraine in this clip.This video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.Sources include:RT.comPOLITICO.euUkraNews.comReuters.comNews.Liga.netBrightU.aiBrighteon.com",neutral,0.01,0.7,0.29,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['U.S. influence', 'EU plan', 'Russian assets', 'legal concerns', 'Japan', 'Ukraine', 'NaturalNews', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Japanese Vice Finance Minister', 'Seven (G7) finance ministers', 'staggering $47.5 billion budget deficit', 'The European Commission', 'Japanese Finance Minister', 'massive budget deficit', 'The Trump administration', 'uncertain foreign aid', 'U.S. influence', 'U.S. opposition', 'U.S. investments', 'broader international participation', 'unresolved funding questions', 'Western financial systems', 'Western financial institutions', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'One EU diplomat', ""EU leaders' summit"", 'U.S. reluctance', 'Russian assets risks', 'Reparations Loan proposal', 'European Union', 'global finance', 'Ukrainian lawmakers', 'Japanese officials', 'Japanese backing', 'Western allies', 'Russian reserves', 'international support', 'International Affairs', 'G7 meeting', 'financial risks', 'financial crisis', 'financial burden', 'complex financial', 'alternative funding', 'immediate funding', 'major blow', 'outright seizure', 'future negotiations', 'partial returns', 'political instability', 'corruption scandals', 'dollar reserves', 'BRICS currencies', 'retaliatory escalation', 'nuclear threats', 'significant setback', 'outright theft', 'multiple reports', 'deepening divisions', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'full amount', 'specific steps', 'national interest', 'alternative plans', 'outright confiscation', 'Enoch engine', 'BrightU.AI', 'political instrument', 'multiple objectives', 'political turmoil', 'Andrey Yermak', 'key aide', 'United Kingdom', 'conditional support', 'immediate needs', 'Tucker Carlson', 'funding efforts', 'war reparations', 'legal constraints', ""Brussels' urgency"", 'legal hurdles', 'EU nations', 'Satsuki Katayama', 'Atsushi Mimura', 'considerable debate', 'profound implications', ""Brussels' efforts"", 'immobilized funds', 'POLITICO report', 'legal concerns', 'EU plan', 'Ukraine', 'Belgium', 'leverage', 'Kyiv', 'trust', 'moves', 'Moscow', 'Reuters', 'Group', 'Monday', 'Dec.', 'alignment', 'scheme', 'goal', 'fears', 'hook', 'money', 'deal', 'Tokyo', 'involvement', 'comment', 'reporters', 'Tuesday', 'response', 'sources', 'stance', 'Washington', 'approach', 'compromise', 'portion', 'remainder', 'core', 'cost', 'scrutiny', 'damages', 'invasion', 'criticisms', 'half', 'dismissal', 'Canada', 'interview']",2025-12-10,2025-12-11,naturalnews.com

The unmet medical need is characterized by strong limitations in current treatments and poor prognosis. GNS561 is an investigational small molecule that targets PPT1  leading to autophagy inhibition and lysosomal dysfunction  which disrupt cancer cell survival mechanisms. By blocking autophagy  GNS561 aims to promote cancer cell death and may enhance sensitivity to other treatments. Combining GNS561 with a MEKi aims to unlock synergistic potential by simultaneously targeting autophagy and MAPK signaling pathways. In the on-going Phase 1b study  patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA who have previously failed one or two lines of prior standard of care therapies are enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with trametinib  a MEKi  and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in Phase 2.Preliminary resultsThe analysis evaluated 9 patients with measurable disease at baseline  4 of them reaching tumor assessment at week 6. At this point  the combination therapy demonstrated:Disease stabilization observed in all 4 evaluated patients  who had all shown disease progression during previous treatment;Tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of patients with the best response showing a 20% reduction approaching the partial response (PR) threshold.Achieving disease control and tumor reduction in such heavily pretreated patient population with advanced CCA is a significant signal of antitumor activity.Clinical ImpactThe results to date show a potential to address a critical unmet medical need in oncology. Patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on multiple prior therapies have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. The ability of the investigational drug GNS561 associated with a MEKi to achieve disease control in this challenging patient population would represent a significant advance. The consistent pattern of disease stabilization observed across all evaluated patients  combined with objective tumor shrinkage in a subgroup of heavily pretreated patients  suggests the combination has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit. Optimization of dosing and patient selection could lead to further improvement in response rates.Dr. Mark Yarchoan  Associate Professor of Oncology at John Hopkins Medicine (Baltimore  MD  USA)  principal investigator of the program  commented: “Advanced KRAS-mutated cholangiocarcinoma remains a formidable clinical challenge  and the emerging activity seen in this initial study is encouraging. Because MEK inhibition alone has historically shown limited efficacy in this setting  the early signs of benefit with dual targeting of autophagy and MAPK signaling provide meaningful rationale for continued evaluation of this combination strategy.”Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT  added: “These early results suggest a potential breakthrough for patients with limited options  and we are committed to advancing this program rapidly to individuals impacted by cholangiocarcinoma. We will also explore GNS561 potential in combination with other agents and in other tumors where autophagy inhibition plays a central role.”Next development stepsPhase 1b dose escalation will continue as planned to confirm the activity signal  with new data for the next patient cohorts expected in 1Q26. These results will be used to establish the recommended Phase 2 combination doses  with completion expected in 1H26. Phase 2 initiation is targeted for 2H26.ENDABOUT CCABiliary tract cancer (BTC) is the second most common primary liver malignancy diagnosed globally. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a type of BTC and represents approximately 15% of all primary liver tumors and 3% of gastrointestinal cancers. Based on its anatomical origin  CCA is best classified anatomically as intrahepatic (iCCA) or extrahepatic (eCCA)  which is comprised of perihilar (pCCA) and distal (dCCA) CCA. Early diagnosis is a major challenge as most patients with early-stage disease do not have symptoms due to limited biliary obstruction. Rather  patients characteristically manifest symptoms related to their underlying cirrhosis  a condition present in some patients with CCA. Taken together  the majority of patients with CCA are diagnosed with advanced disease  often precluding potentially curative therapies. There are limited therapeutic options for this aggressive disease. The 5-year survival rates drop to 5-15% in the advanced and unresectable settings. The only potentially curative treatment remains surgical resection. Unfortunately  at time of first diagnosis  only about 25% of the patients are eligible for surgery. Moreover  even after curative intent surgery  the clinical outcomes are disappointing  with 5-year survival rates of 7% to 20%.ABOUT GNS561GNS561 is a first-in-class investigational lysosomotropic agent with a novel mechanism of action. When combined with MEK inhibitors  GNS561 targets complementary pathways critical for cancer cell survival and proliferation  resulting in potent antitumor activity. The combination is being developed as a potential breakthrough therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors. In December 2021  we licensed the exclusive rights from Genoscience Pharma to develop and commercialize the investigational treatment GNS561 in CCA in the United States  Canada and Europe  including the United Kingdom and Switzerland. In early 2025  GENFIT completed the acquisition of the full intellectual property rights for GNS561 from Genoscience Pharma  expanding upon the limited rights initially obtained through the 2021 license.ABOUT THE GNS561-222-1 TRIALThe GNS561-222-1 trial is an ongoing Phase I/II clinical study evaluating the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of GNS561 in combination with a MEK inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial uses RECIST 1.1 criteria to assess tumor response and includes comprehensive biomarker analyses to identify predictive markers of response.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

54143,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2025/12/10/850524.htm,Reuters: Ben & Jerry’s Board Chair Won’t Resign as Pressure Mounts From Unilever Unit,The chair of Ben & Jerry’s independent board said she has no plans to resign as Unilever pressured her ahead of Monday’s public spinoff of its Magnum ice cream division  which will include the Vermont-based brand. Magnum  a longtime division …,The chair of Ben & Jerry’s independent board said she has no plans to resign as Unilever pressured her ahead of Monday’s public spinoff of its Magnum ice cream division  which will include the Vermont-based brand.Magnum  a longtime division of the consumer goods conglomerate  said last month that the chair  Anuradha Mittal  “no longer meets the criteria” to serve after internal investigations  without providing further details.Magnum began listing publicly on Euronext on Monday  and is inheriting a deepening corporate feud between Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s  stemming from the politically progressive brand’s stance on the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.An audit of the separate Ben & Jerry’s Foundation  a U.S.-based non-profit where Mittal is also a trustee  found deficiencies in financial controls and governance. Mittal has been the chair of Ben & Jerry’s independent board since 2018  according to her LinkedIn profile  and a trustee of the foundation since 2012  according to its website.ATTEMPT TO ‘UNDERMINE’ THE BOARD“The so-called audit of the foundation was a manufactured inquiry — engineered to attempt to discredit me ” Mittal said in her statement  saying she will not resign. “It is important to understand that this is not simply an attack on me as chair. It is Unilever’s attempt to undermine the authority of the Board itself.”Mittal said she is carrying out her role as chair with respect for the social mission and product quality responsibilities given to the board in Ben & Jerry’s 2000 merger agreement with Unilever.“This is not about individuals  it is about the consistent application of good governance principles and practices across The Magnum Ice Cream Company ” Magnum said in a statement on Monday.Magnum said the audit was carried out in preparation for its demerger from Unilever.Unilever said it had requested the audit as a matter of good governance and that Magnum was taking appropriate steps in response to the audit’s findings.As a standalone unit  Magnum will command roughly one-fifth of the global ice cream market. The company has warned in securities filings that actions by Ben & Jerry’s could result in reputational damage  boycotts or investor claims.The Ben & Jerry’s independent board is aimed at preserving the brand’s social mission  while the foundation  a separate U.S.-based non-profit  receives millions in contributions solely from the company based on how much of the premium ice cream is sold.YEARS OF CLASHESThe board has sued Unilever twice in recent years  most recently accusing its corporate parent of censoring it over statements it wanted to make on Gaza. Unilever has said the brand had evolved into one-sided advocacy on polarizing topics.In a separate statement  the foundation’s board of trustees said it has been told that the audit’s “central unresolved issue is Unilever/Magnum’s demand that Anuradha Mittal … be removed as a Foundation trustee.”It said Magnum and Unilever continues to withhold funding for the foundation despite contractual obligations and the organization’s cooperation with the audit.Magnum said it had fully funded the foundation for 2025 and was ready to do so in the future  provided the trustees address the governance issues it raised.The counsel for the independent board added that the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation’s governance has been the same for over 20 years.“Either Unilever has been asleep at the wheel for over 20 years while disbursing millions  or there is an ulterior motive ” it said.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; editing by David Gaffen  Nick Zieminski and Bernadette Baum),neutral,0.0,0.73,0.26,negative,0.0,0.05,0.95,True,English,"['Board Chair', 'Pressure Mounts', 'Unilever Unit', 'Reuters', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'separate U.S.-based non-profit', 'global ice cream market', 'The Magnum Ice Cream Company', 'Magnum ice cream division', 'premium ice cream', 'consumer goods conglomerate', 'Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories', 'product quality responsibilities', 'central unresolved issue', 'deepening corporate feud', 'good governance principles', 'longtime division', 'THE BOARD', 'corporate parent', 'separate Ben', 'The Ben', 'separate statement', 'public spinoff', 'internal investigations', 'financial controls', 'LinkedIn profile', 'social mission', '2000 merger agreement', 'consistent application', 'appropriate steps', 'standalone unit', 'securities filings', 'reputational damage', 'investor claims', 'one-sided advocacy', 'polarizing topics', 'contractual obligations', 'ulterior motive', 'Jessica DiNapoli', 'New York', 'David Gaffen', 'Nick Zieminski', 'Bernadette Baum', 'governance issues', 'independent board', 'Vermont-based brand', 'progressive brand', 'Anuradha Mittal', 'recent years', 'Ben & Jerry', 'Foundation trustee', '20 years', 'chair', 'plans', 'Unilever', 'Monday', 'criteria', 'details', 'Euronext', 'stance', 'audit', 'deficiencies', 'website', 'ATTEMPT', 'inquiry', 'attack', 'authority', 'role', 'respect', 'individuals', 'practices', 'preparation', 'demerger', 'matter', 'response', 'findings', 'one-fifth', 'actions', 'boycotts', 'millions', 'contributions', 'CLASHES', 'statements', 'Gaza', 'trustees', 'demand', 'funding', 'organization', 'cooperation', 'future', 'counsel', 'wheel', 'editing']",2025-12-10,2025-12-11,insurancejournal.com

Partially funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union  the trial results continue to support future Phase 3 development in children  which the Company plans to initiate after gathering additional real-world experience in the adolescent population.Final VLA1553-221 results aligned with the initial data and six-month outcomes that the Company previously reported for this trial in January 20251 and June 20252 respectively. A full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) elicited a higher immune response in children aged one to eleven years at Day 360 post vaccination compared to a half dose. Overall  the immunological response profile was in line with what was previously observed in adults and adolescents345678.The strong immune response was confirmed in CHIKV-naïve children with a 94.7% seroresponse rate (full dose) at Day 360. The vaccine was well tolerated in children aged one to eleven years regardless of the dose or previous CHIKV infection. No safety concerns were identified.The comparability of the vaccine doses tested in terms of safety and tolerability  along with the more pronounced immune response of the full dose observed for all age groups tested in children up to Day 360 post-vaccination  continues to support the selection of the full dose for use in this population.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “The twelve months persistence and safety data in children are consistent with the robust antibody response and favorable safety profile previously observed in adolescents following a single vaccination. As safety is of the utmost importance  particularly when advancing into a Phase 3 pediatric study  we have decided  in alignment with the regulatory authorities  to continue gathering additional real-world experience in the adolescent population before initiating our planned Phase 3 study in children. We remain convinced  considering the significant risk chikungunya poses to individuals living in or traveling to endemic areas  that it is crucial to ensure a vaccine capable of potentially offering long-term protection from a single shot is accessible to people of all ages. This is especially important in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) where access to vaccines is often limited.”Brazil has reported the highest number of chikungunya cases worldwide  with over one million cases between January 2019 and July 20249  followed by India with 370 000 cases during the same period. Reports of Chikungunya infection have expanded rapidly and globally in 2025  with six countries (Bangladesh  Cuba  China; Kenya  Madagascar  Somalia and Sri Lanka) currently experiencing CHIKV outbreaks10.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years11.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas12. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas13 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.14About Phase 2 Trial VLA1553-221VLA1553-221 was a multi-center  randomized  observer-blinded  dose response Phase 2 clinical trial in 304 healthy children aged one to eleven years. The trial was performed at three trial sites in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. The primary and secondary objectives of the trial were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dose levels of Valneva’s single-shot chikungunya vaccine. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to receive either a full dose (licensed IXCHIQ® formulation and presentation) or a half dose of the vaccine  or an active control (Nimenrix).

Now Heineken®  the champion of IRL socialising  has launched new WhatsApp technology that offers an ingenious incentive to those who’d prefer to meet up and connect face-to-face  bringing back the art of in person conversation.The technology has been launched as a pilot in Brazil  where official data from META shows that Brazilians send four times as many voice notes than people in any other country.The tech was devised after global research polling 14 000 respondents showed that in just one year  the average person spends almost 150 hours a year sending and receiving voice notes.Not only are people spending a significant amount of time listening to voice notes  but they are impacting real-life social interactions too. Over half (52%) of those polled feel voice notes are replacing IRL interactions  rising to 60% amongst Gen Z. Nearly half (49%)  meanwhile  admit to spending entire evenings sending voice notes to a friend instead of meeting in-person  even though 54% say they have their most fulfilling conversations face-to-face.Global data and business intelligence platform Statista reported  in groundbreaking new data  that 9.4 billion WhatsApp voice notes are now sent every day (equivalent to about 3.4 trillion over the full year). When compared to 2024  their frequency has increased by 7%  and in length by 8%.Stacy Jo Dixon  Social Media and Society Expert at Statista  said: “Our data suggests that voice notes are not just growing in frequency but also length. With nearly 9.5 billion voice notes sent daily on WhatsApp alone (compared to 7 billion in 2022)  it’s evident that voice messaging is reshaping the way we communicate across the globe and taking on a more prominent role alongside traditional in-person interactions.”While many use voice notes as a ‘catch up shortcut’  people are barely engaged with them. Over half (55%) admit they often forget to listen to them  and even when they do listen  attention is low: 88% forget what was actually said in the message.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of HeinekenⓇ  said: ""Just like we all know meetings that ‘could have been an email’  we’re now seeing voice notes that ‘Could have been a Heineken’.“Voice notes can feel more personal than reading a message  but what our research shows is that we need to make sure they don’t turn into mini-podcasts  and that we’re having two-way conversations rather than an extended monologue.“At Heineken  we want to make it easier for people to share moments of socialisation in real life. That’s why we have launched the ‘Could have been a Heineken’ WhatsApp bot  incentivising people to swap long voice notes for a refreshing in-person catch up over a beer of course.”The ‘Could have been a Heineken’ WhatsApp technology is currently being tested in Brazil  with further global markets set to follow.To redeem the offer  WhatsApp users over 18 must forward a voice note that they have received  which is longer than three minutes  to a private  encrypted bot. The user will then receive a message saying it ‘Could have been a Heineken’  alongside a voucher for a free beer and a recommendation of local bars to meet up with the friend in real life.Notes to editorsMedia contact:HeinekenBrazil@wearetheromans.comResearch Credits:*Heineken commissioned a survey of 14 000 respondents across the United Kingdom  USA  Germany  India  Brazil  United Arab Emirates and Romania.

With this latest order  the total number of devices under the contract  including options  reaches c.200 000. THEON remains the largest supplier of Night Vision equipment in Europe  now having secured significant backlog visibility over the next 4 years until 2029.In line with the original contract and the previous amendments  this Contract requires deliveries of the Mikron binocular  powered by Exosens 16 mm tubes . THEON has recently secured the supply of more than 400 000 Image Intensifier Tubes (IIT) through the latest extension of its Long-Term Commercial Agreement (LTCA) with Exosens to the end of 2030 (as announced on 3 December 2025). The LTCA more than allows Theon to fulfil all its existing requirements  with capacity to fulfill further new orders.Consistent with THEON’s continuous local fulfillment strategy followed in previous orders  part of the assembly will take place in Germany  at the joint company Hensoldt Theon NightVision (HTN) facility  in Wetzlar  Hesse. In order to fulfill its part of the Contract  and support the ongoing anticipated growth in orders  HTN shall move into new much larger facilities in Q2 2026 with its number of employees to triple by the end of the coming year.Following this order  THEON’s 2025 year‑to‑date order intake stands as €1.3 bn  and inclusive of new options attached to this order intake is c.€2 bn. The total backlog as of today  inclusive of additional options of c.€865 m  totals c.€2.4 bn. Historically  options embedded in contracts and framework agreements have been fully exercised into firm orders.Christian Hadjiminas  Founder and CEO of THEON  stated: “This Contract Revision represents the largest single procurement of NVGs in the history of a European NATO member  if not the largest ever placed globally. The anticipated acceleration in order intake has already translated into long-term framework agreements announced in recent weeks. In anticipation of this  that is why we moved early to secure the image intensifier tube (IIT) supply chain through investing in Harder Digital and Exosens  in a market where global supply remains structurally below demand. We see accelerating demand as customers seek to equip increasing numbers of soldiers with night-vision capabilities and weapon-mounted systems. On top of the already announced orders in Europe  recent newsflow about APAC defense-spending increases confirms our outlook. Notably  order intake this year currently stands at more than 3x expected 2025 revenue  versus our guidance of c. 2x  rising to over 4x if including the attached new options. Once the announced Share Capital Increase concludes and regulatory constraints are lifted  we will be in a position to provide EBIT guidance for 2025 and 2026.”Philippe Mennicken  Deputy CEO and Business Development Director of THEON  emphasizes: “We are pleased to remain a reliable partner in equipping the German Bundeswehr. Night Vision devices are not a luxury; they are essential on today’s battlefield  as recent conflicts have clearly demonstrated. With this trend evident in Europe and increasingly visible across the APAC region  THEON expects to continue growing faster than the market in the man‑portable segment. Our strategy focuses on cementing our position in Night Vision and expanding our addressable market  introducing new adjacent products for the soldiers.”From the signing of the agreement (from left): Mr. Christian Hadjiminas  Founder and CEO of THEON  Mr. Joachim Sucker  OCCAR-EA Director  Ms. Christina Canitz  Head of Hensoldt Optronics  Mr. Michael Holzmann  Managing Director of Hensoldt Theon NightVisionFrom the signing of the agreement: Representatives from OCCAR  German and Belgian MoD  THEON and HensoldtMikron Night Vision Goggle of THEONFor inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

Now  we are ready for the next frontier: to fully capture the opportunities in the largest life insurance market in the world: the US. With Transamerica  which now represents around 70% of our operations  we are strongly positioned to serve a large and underserved segment: Main Street American families  and medium-sized companies. Aegon’s ambition is clear: we want to become a leading US life insurance and retirement group.”Aegon’s decision to relocate its head office and legal domicile follows the review that was announced in August 2025. The move supports Aegon’s commitment to prioritize resources towards building a leading US life insurance and retirement group. Aegon aims to begin to report under US GAAP for the first time at its full year 2027 results. To facilitate the transition  Aegon will stop publishing trading updates in 2026 and 2027  limiting disclosures to comprehensive half-year reporting. After the relocation  Transamerica Inc.’s common stock will remain listed on Euronext and NYSE.Lard Friese said: “The organizational implications of our decision to relocate to the US are profound and defining for our identity. I realize this decision will  ultimately  result in a significant impact for colleagues at our head office in the Netherlands. We will work to support our colleagues throughout the process. While this was not an easy decision to make  it fully embraces the reality of our business and prioritizes resources to build a leading franchise in the US. Once the re-domiciliation is completed  Aegon will change its name to Transamerica Inc. and become an American life insurance  annuity  and retirement group with international insurance and asset management subsidiaries.”Aegon intends to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting in the fourth quarter of 2026 to seek shareholder approval for the move to the US. Vereniging Aegon  Aegon’s largest shareholder  considers the decision to relocate Aegon Ltd. to the US an important and positive step for Aegon. Vereniging Aegon has indicated that it will review and constructively consider any forthcoming proposals in relation to the impact on the Vereniging of the proposed relocation to the US.The transition is expected to have an estimated one-time implementation cost of around EUR 350 million to be incurred between 2H 2025 and 1H 2028.Reinsurance of a portfolio of SGUL policies with a net face value of USD 10 billionConsistent with its strategy to reduce capital employed by Financial Assets  which are legacy blocks  Aegon has decided to reinsure a block of Secondary Guarantee Universal Life (SGUL) contracts. The transaction covers 30% of the face value of Transamerica’s SGUL business  bringing the total value addressed to 80% of the total SGUL portfolio in combination with previously executed management actions. It decreases the total capital employed by USD 0.3 billion to USD 2.7 billion  well ahead of the targeted reduction in 2025.The transaction occurs at a price consistent with Aegon’s best estimate assumptions  resulting in a minimal impact on the company’s IFRS valuation equity and operating profit  while removing potential variances and risks associated with mortality and policyholder behavior in the future.The transaction will unwind existing financing structures and trigger tax constraints along with realized losses  impacting the RBC ratio. It comes together with a USD 800 million investment into Transamerica which neutralizes the impact on the RBC ratio and will enable additional operating capital generation and remittances of USD 75 million per annum  which compares favorably to the alternatives.Maximizing the value of Aegon’s business portfolioIn the US  the underlying market trends favor Transamerica’s business: people are living longer  the protection gap is widening  and there is significant opportunity for Aegon to support American families in preparing for retirement. To underpin Aegon’s growth plans  Transamerica aims to:Make World Financial Group (WFG)  Transamerica’s affiliated insurance distribution network of more than 92 000 independent agents  the top agent network for “Main Street” America (middle market and mass affluent)  with the aim to increase WFG’s total life sales by 14% per annum to around USD 900 million and increase WFG’s total annuity sales by 7% per annum to around USD 5.0 billion in 2027.Scale the Protection Solution business by increasing life sales by 15% per annum to around USD 720 million in 2027.Capitalize on Transamerica’s leadership position in pooled Retirement plans and broaden its ancillary product range  targeting approximately USD 275 billion Retirement plan AuA in 2027  while increasing Return on Assets from 8 bps (YTD 2025) to around 11 bps.Continue to decrease Transamerica’s exposure to its Financial Assets.This plan aims to enable Transamerica to grow its operating result and its remittances by around 5% per annum over the course of the next two years from a 2025 run-rate of USD 1.4 to 1.6 billion and USD 675 million respectively. This includes the impact of the SGUL reinsurance transaction and related investment into Transamerica.In addition  Aegon outlined its plans for its asset management business  which include:Expanding its third-party business segment by focusing on higher revenue-margin strategies which will enable third-party revenue growth to outpace AuM growth.Implementing a number of initiatives to improve the scalability and efficiency of its organization with the ambition to improve the Global Platforms operating margin to at least 20% in 2027  from around 16% expected for 2025. Key enablers include cost reduction programs  a simpler business organization and a single portfolio management system.Growing its Strategic Partnerships in China and France  which have historically been a strong source of earnings and remittances.Continuing the strong collaboration between Transamerica and Aegon Asset Management (Aegon AM)  which includes investment in capabilities to contribute to Transamerica's growth plans.These plans aim to increase Aegon AM’s operating result to more than EUR 200 million in 2027  from a 2025 run-rate of EUR 170–200 million  and to increase its remittances of approximately EUR 80 million estimated for 2025 by more than 5% per annum until 2027.In the UK  Aegon’s strategy to transform Aegon UK into a leading digital savings and retirement platform  as outlined in June 2024  continues to make good progress and the business remains a reliable and growing source of revenues for the Group. In the context of our stronger focus on the U.S.  Aegon will begin a strategic review of Aegon UK to assess the best way to accelerate and maximize value for all stakeholders. In this review all options will be evaluated  including a potential divestment.With respect to its International business  which includes growth markets in Spain & Portugal  Brazil  China  and Transamerica Life Bermuda  Aegon will continue to invest in profitable growth. These businesses  primarily operated through partnerships  will continue to upstream remittances and contribute to the Group’s operating results  building their growth on product innovation  customer service  and expanding distribution.a.s.r. shareholdingAegon will remain a patient shareholder of a.s.r. and benefit from its progress  holding its stake until the a.s.r. share price reflects its intrinsic value and/or until value-creating opportunities present themselves. As Aegon CEO Lard Friese  who is currently a non-independent member of the supervisory board of a.s.r.  will be fully focused on delivering on the ambitions that Aegon has set out today  Aegon will nominate a new member of the supervisory board of a.s.r. Following the approval of the nominee by all relevant stakeholders of a.s.r.  Lard Friese will step down as non-independent member of its supervisory board.Capital management implicationsUnder the new strategic ambition  Aegon’s approach to capital management will not change. Aegon's operating companies will remain well capitalized and Cash Capital at Holding will be maintained around the mid-point of the EUR 0.5 to 1.5 billion operating range. Excess capital will be returned to shareholders over time  unless it can be invested in value-creating opportunities. To support shareholder returns and reach the targeted level of EUR 1.0 billion at the end of 2026  Aegon announces today a new EUR 400 million share buyback program to be split evenly between the first and the second half of 2026. The share buyback program will start at the beginning of January 2026.Consistent with the strategy announced today  the financial flexibility enabled by the capital management framework will be prioritized to the US.Across its businesses  Aegon will continue to increase the proportion of capital employed in strategic business lines with attractive returns. At the same time  Aegon aims to drive capital employed by the US Financial Assets down to USD 2.2 billion by year-end 2027  while reducing risk sensitivities through management actions and transactions.Financial targetsAs a result of Aegon’s plans to further strengthen its businesses and grow profitably:The company’s operating result is expected to grow by around 5% per annum between 2025 and 2027 from EUR 1.5 - 1.7 billion (run-rate taking into account an assumed EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.20)  driven by growth of Aegon’s US Strategic Assets.OCG after holding funding and operating expenses is expected to grow between 0% and 5% per annum over the same timeframe  from around EUR 0.9 billion for 2025 (run-rate taking into account both the positive impact of the SGUL derisking transaction and related investment into Transamerica and the negative impact of an assumed EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.20) as higher earnings on in-force are offset by higher new business strain.Free cash flow is expected to grow by around 5% per annum from around EUR 0.8 billion per year (run-rate taking into account both the positive impact of the SGUL derisking transaction and related investment into Transamerica and the negative impact of an assumed EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.20 and the reduced cash flows from a.s.r. driven by the reduced size of the stake) as the pay-out ratio of OCG gradually increases over time.Dividends remain well covered by free cash flow and  on a per share basis  will benefit from the reduction in share count from the announced share buyback programs  enabling a growth of dividend per share in excess of 5% per annum.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Richard Mackillican Yves Cormier +31 (0) 6 27 41 15 46 +44 (0) 782 337 1511 richard.mackillican@aegon.com yves.cormier@aegon.comLink to live Capital Markets Day webcastAegon is hosting a Capital Markets Day (CMD) in London on December 10 from 13:00 GMT (14:00 CET) to provide an update on our strategy and financial targets.

Like what you see? You can subscribe here. The dispatch Lovers of ice cream brands like Magnum  Cornetto  Carte D'Or  Ben & Jerry's  Breyers and Wall's can now own shares in them directly following Monday's demerger of The Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC) from former parent Unilever. In one of the splashiest stock market events of 2025  shares of TMICC debuted on Amsterdam's Euronext  and there are also secondary listings in London and New York — where Peter ter Kulve  the chief executive  will ring the opening bell today. (He'll also be live on CNBC's Squawk on the Street at 3 p.m. GMT/10 a.m. ET.) The listing  Euronext's largest this year  valued TMICC  the world's biggest ice cream producer  at 7.8 billion euros ($9.1 billion).Magnum Ice Cream Company signage as a trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York  US  on Monday  Dec. 8  2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBut what are the prospects for the newly demerged business and for Unilever itself? Neither question is easily answered. First: TMICC  where even the share price prospects are unpredictable in the short term. The company itself has warned that  as it will not qualify for indices such as the FTSE 100  there could be initial selling by tracker funds unable to hold the stock. The lack of a dividend in 2026 will also deter some investors. Unilever and its banking advisors sought to address this by setting a low reference price for TMICC shares and  accordingly  some bargain hunters may step in. And it is cheap: including debt  TMICC is worth little more than the next-biggest player in the $87-billion global ice cream market  Froneri  a British-based joint venture between Nestle and PAI Partners  the French private equity firm. It has an 11% global market share compared with TMICC's 21%. In terms of trading prospects  there are also headwinds  most obviously the growing popularity of weight-loss drugs. Ahead of the demerger  ter Kulve played down these risks  arguing that for years TMICC has evolved its portfolio to include more products with reduced sugar  higher amounts of protein or in which portions can be controlled. Examples include Breyers CarbSmart ice cream  which is higher in protein  or Ben & Jerry's move from pint cartons to ice cream on sticks. The CEO is targeting medium-term organic annual sales growth of 3%-5%  compared with the long-term average of 3% achieved under Unilever. There may also be opportunities for TMICC  as a more focused business  to increase investments in its supply chain  where there was little overlap with Unilever's other businesses  potentially leaving it neglected. That goes for the investment story more broadly. As Chris Beckett  consumer staples analyst at the wealth manager Quilter Cheviot  put it: ""While Magnum hasn't thrived under Unilever's ownership  there is some hope that the revitalised management team — albeit predominantly made up of ex-Unilever employees — will produce a better operating performance."" There is another potential thorn in ter Kulve's side. Ben & Jerry's  bought in April 2000 from founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield  has been increasingly problematic.Tubs of Ben and Jerry's ice cream is displayed for sale in a freezer at a supermarket. Matt Cardy | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn 2021  the pair briefly stopped Unilever from selling the product in Israeli settlements in the West Bank  before the ensuing backlash prompted Unilever to sell the brand's Israeli arm to a local licensee. Greenfield left the business in September this year  while last month  TMICC said that Anuradha Mittal  chair of the Ben & Jerry's independent board  ""no longer meets the criteria"" to serve  without giving more details. In a typical piece of Dutch plain speaking  ter Kulve told the Financial Times on Monday the pair should ""hand over to a new generation."" He warned that TMICC might no longer continue contributing to the Ben & Jerry's charitable foundation unless corporate governance failures identified in a recent audit were addressed. The spat is another reason why Unilever will be happy to offload TMICC — where returns have been lower than in its other businesses  even though it is  for now  retaining a 19.9% stake  which will be sold over the next five years. A long overdue re-rating? The bigger question  though  is whether this latest reshaping of Unilever will lead to a re-rating by the market. I have been covering this company's fortunes for more than 30 years and have witnessed countless attempts to achieve this. Coming in  there were the purchases in 2000 of Ben & Jerry's  Slim-Fast (since sold) and Best Foods  which brought Unilever the Hellmann's brand; the ill-fated $1 billion acquisition of Dollar Shave Club in 2016; and the 2019 acquisition of the healthy snacking brand Graze  again since sold. Going out of the door have been Unilever's speciality chemicals business  sold to ICI for £5 billion ($6.66 billion) in 1997; its spreads business — including the Flora brand — which was sold to KKR for 6.7 billion euros in 2017 and  more recently  the £3.8 billion sale in 2021 of Unilever's black tea business  owner of iconic brands such as PG Tips and Liptons  to the private equity firm CVC. Not to mention a whole host of smaller disposals  such as Ambrosia creamed rice and Brown & Polson cornflour  both sold to Premier Foods in 2003 and Birds Eye frozen food  offloaded to Permira in 2006. In between  there have been numerous strategic overhauls. Terry Smith  whose investment firm Fundsmith is one of Unilever's top 10 shareholders  noted last year they have included 2010's Unilever Sustainable Living Plan  2016's Connected 4 Growth and 2022's Unilever Compass Strategy for Sustainable Growth. Yet none mattered as much as the move  five years ago  to a single company structure that ended the 90-year-old arrangement of two parents — the British Unilever plc and the Dutch Unilever NV — and provided more corporate flexibility. The demerger of TMICC feels almost as fundamental. At a stroke  it raises the quality of Unilever's earnings  leaving it even more focused on the two dozen or so brands that account for three-quarters of its annual sales. Of these  a dozen have annual sales exceeding 1 billion euros  including Dove  Omo and Domestos. As Fernando Fernandez  the newish chief executive and a man plainly in a hurry  noted on LinkedIn on Monday: ""For Unilever  this milestone allows us to keep sharpening our focus in building a portfolio of power brands with unparalleled geographical footprint and superior growth prospects."" Notably  just two of these 1-billion-euro brands — Knorr and Hellmann's — reside in its food division.
