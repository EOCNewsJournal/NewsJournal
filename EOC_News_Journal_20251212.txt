54156,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/12/trump-administration-joins-eu-in-russian-frozen-asset-madness.html,Trump Administration Joins EU in Russian Frozen Asset Madness,I want whatever Team Trump is smoking. Their Russian frozen assets plan has achieved impressive new levels of delusion.,The level of derangement among far too many of our putative betters has reached such a fever pitch that mere narcissism and grandiosity seem inadequate as explanations. The latest example comes via the Wall Street Journal  in an exclusive account as to how the Trump Administration intends to avail itself of Russian central bank frozen assets  with the fig leaf that of course Russia would go along to curry favor with Trump and because investing in a busted up country is clearly a fabulous commercial opportunity. Let us not forget that the US tried a more adult version of this plan and got nowhere. It hired BlackRock as an adviser to flog a Ukraine reconstruction fund 1 back the days when the tale that Ukraine would win the war seems much more plausible  and got nowhere.The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials  since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as €140 billion or more worth in Euroclear.2Mind you  the Europeans  in the persons of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen  and her allies in planned Russian asset heist like Emmanuel Macron  Kier Starmer  Frederich Merz  and Kaja Kallas  are as deluded  but less flamboyantly so  since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in peril. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist  even if it is fiercely opposed.But back to the more obviously bonkers Trump plan. The Journal account suggests that the Trump plan to use Russia frozen assets in a US managed “fund” for Ukraine reconstruction  which was part of leaked 28 points plan  has set off the frenzy in European capitals to grab them pronto  before the US and Russia can come to an agreement….as if that were at all likely. From U.S. Blueprint to Rewire Economies of Russia  Ukraine Sets Off Clash With Europe:The Trump administration in recent weeks has handed its European counterparts a series of documents  each a single page  laying out its vision for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the return of Russia to the global economy… The U.S. blueprint has been spelled out in appendices to current peace proposals that aren’t public but were described to The Wall Street Journal by U.S. and European officials. The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops.Let’s stop here. The Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant is not merely “currently occupied”. It is in one of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia and Russia  per its constitution  has made part of Russia. There is simply no way that the West is going to get use of it on anything other than arms-length commercial terms.Any discussion of power or reconstruction of Ukraine generally ignore the fact that no one other than Russia can execute it. Recall that Russia has already done considerable damage to not just Ukraine electricity transmission but increasing to generation as well. Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards  as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge.And of course there is the overriding highly optimistic assumption  that there will be an economically and politically independent Ukraine after the war. Ukraine and the EU are laboring mightily to make sure that does not happen. Their continued intransigence and belligerence have made the case to a highly risk-averse Putin that Russia will have to dictate outcomes on the battlefield. So the only question is how much Russia decides it has to add to Russia versus make into a rump Ukraine overseen by a friendly regime.Back to the Journal:Another appendix offers America’s broad-strokes vision for bringing Russia’s economy in from the cold  with U.S. companies investing in strategic sectors from rare-earth extraction to drilling for oil in the Arctic  and helping to restore Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the rest of the world.This is the worst sort of arrogant paternalism  as if Russia still needed the West.The quiet scandal in global economics: From 2008 to 2025  Russia’s real GDP per capita grew faster than Germany  the UK  and France despite sanctions  SWIFT bans  export controls  frozen assets and a full-scale geopolitical confrontation. pic.twitter.com/0C7ijjrCcc — . (@Lucid_Watcher) December 5  2025But not to worry  the Journal reassures us that Russia really is hurting:A new assessment by a Western intelligence agency  reviewed by the Journal  said that Russia has technically been in recession for six months and that the challenges of running its war economy while trying to control prices are presenting a systemic risk to its banking sector.One has to assume the Russian negotiators were also informed about this scheme (a version of this idea  but perhaps less detailed  was to be respectfully receptive when the US presented this asset  erm  usage plan  as opposed to bursting out laughing  or alternatively getting angry over being presumed to be total chumps.Returning to the Journal:Some European officials who have seen the documents said they weren’t sure whether to take some of the U.S. proposals seriously. One official compared them to President Trump’s vision of building a Riviera-style development in Gaza. Another  referring to the proposed U.S.-Russia energy deals  said it was an economic version of the 1945 conference where World War II victors divvied up Europe. “It’s like Yalta ” he said.Readers are encouraged to opine  but given the early similarly high-handed-while-also-barmy Ukraine “raw earths” scheme that the US browbeat Ukraine into accepting after some negotiation  yours truly thinks this is part of Team Trump following the Red Queen practice of working to believe impossible things. Such as:U.S. officials involved in the negotiations say Europe’s approach would quickly deplete the frozen funds. Washington  on the other hand  would tap Wall Street executives and private-equity billionaires to invest the money and expand the amount available to invest. One official involved in the talks said the pot could grow to $800 billion under American management. “Our sensibility is that we really understand financial growth ” the official said.Now to the European part. Ursula von der Leyen is attempting to ram through legislation that would allow the Commission to seize the frozen assets in Euroclear pursuant to emergency powers. Belgium has objected vociferously since it would be on the hook if Euroclear were sued successfully. The ECB has refused to provide a backstop:I asked ECB President Lagarde about the potential impact on financial stability of using Russian frozen assets held at Euroclear (140 billion). The ECB has (rightly) indicated that a guarantee would be a breach of the Treaty. Other options urgently needed for Ukraine👇 @wbeke pic.twitter.com/ih9j89n5GV — Dirk Gotink (@DirkGotink) December 3  2025Since Euroclear has also said in no uncertain terms that it thinks the asset heist  prettied up as trying to use the assets as collateral for loans  is illegal  I am not sure how it can be compelled to turn over the funds  given the general rule of “possession is 9/10 of the law” and the near-certainty that Euroclear and Belgium would seek an injunction too.❗️Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever called the European Commission's proposal to use frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a reparations loan “theft ” reports VRT NWS. “There are certainly better solutions than stealing the Russian central bank’s money.

From a Wednesday story:EU countries are to fast-track a decision to indefinitely immobilise up to €210bn in Russian sovereign assets  in an attempt to bypass Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán even before Europe’s leaders meet for a summit next week. The hurried effort to pass the legislation — which invokes emergency powers to override national vetoes on the extension of sanctions — aims to protect Brussels’ leverage in US-led peace talks over the war in Ukraine  according to officials familiar with the plans. Diplomats handling the legislation see advantage in moving swiftly in coming days to detach the contentious question of immobilising assets from the debate on raising loans for Kyiv backed by the frozen Russian funds. That funding question will be left to EU leaders next week. The move to vote within the coming week  overriding the principle of unanimity on sanctions decisions  risks enraging Hungary and other countries that oppose the measure. Past instances of EU countries outvoting other member states on critical issues — such as Poland and Hungary on migration policy — have caused bad blood between capitals for years. The European Commission last week proposed using €210bn of Russia’s foreign assets immobilised under sanctions in the EU to fund a loan to Kyiv  initially for €90bn that would be disbursed in the next two years. For the loan scheme to work  the underlying assets need to be immobilised indefinitely  rather than for six-month periods that can only be renewed with unanimous agreement of all EU27 countries… To bypass the risk of the sanctions being lifted  the commission has proposed using emergency powers reserved for dealing with economic crises to indefinitely impose the sanctions on the assets. Enacted under Article 122 of the EU’s treaties  it can be passed with just a majority of EU countries  circumventing potential vetoes.Mind you  there is no crisis. There will be a tsunami of litigation if the Commission and its allies manage to get this scheme implemented. And there would be a crisis due to their malfeasance if the plaintiffs were to prevail. So the plan is use emergency powers to contend with the emergency knowingly produced by entirely voluntary action decried by those best in the know (Euroclear) as illegal. Alexander Mercouris covered the circularity of this argument in his video on Wednesday  and earlier argued that the loud and clear objections by Euroclear and the Belgian government would be powerful ammo in litigation over any seizure attempt.As an aside  one has to think that a and perhaps the reason that Ursula von der Leyen has pursued this scheme so manically is that it is far and away her best opportunity to greatly expand the Commission’s powers. She’s been on a massive land grab ever since she took office.This morning’s Politico European newsletter seemed less bullish than the prior day pink paper account  and also corrected the barmy idea that Orban was the big baddie:GROUNDHOG DAYENVOYS DISCUSS ASSETS SUPERFREEZE: EU ambassadors will today weigh up whether to hand the Commission emergency powers to keep Russia’s state assets frozen indefinitely. Envoys will examine updated legal texts after Wednesday’s inconclusive discussion  three EU diplomats told POLITICO’s Gregorio Sorgi. What’s that: The mechanism is a cornerstone of the Commission’s plan to mobilize €210 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine — most of which are held by the Belgian-based Euroclear. It would overhaul the current system that compels EU countries to unanimously reauthorize the sanctions every six months. That means Kremlin-friendly countries such as Hungary and Slovakia would lose the power to release the sanctioned money with a simple no vote  leaving EU capitals on the hook to repay the loan to Russia. The light at the end of the tunnel: The diplomats said late Wednesday that the proposal could be “stripped down” in a bid to win Belgium’s support and adopt the plan by the end of the week. Hopefully. Yes  it’s still all about Belgium: PM Bart De Wever is holding out over concerns that Belgium could be financially exposed if the money needs to be repaid and has now asked for more safety nets. In an interview with VRT NWS Wednesday  De Wever even refused to rule out legal action if the EU moves ahead with seizing the assets… More stick than carrot: Europe’s strategy to sway Belgium may be to warn the kingdom that it could be treated like Hungary if it doesn’t come on board — with its diplomats  ministers and officials losing their voice around the EU table  reports Zoya Sheftalovich.The Politico entry contains this amusing section:.“No jurisdiction”: A legal memo circulated among diplomats Wednesday by law firm Covington & Burling rejects Belgium’s argument that it would face major legal retaliation from Russia. The four-page document says the risk of litigation is “minimal ” insisting Russia wouldn’t be able to challenge an EU reparations loan in the International Criminal Court or “any comparable international adjudicative body.”Legally-sophisticated readers know that if you look long enough  you can find a lawyer who will bless pretty much anything.3 And I don’t think of Covington as premier firm in financial or international litigation. I would have thought one of the top New York “white shoe” or London firms would be the go-tos on this topic. A ranking by Chambers of US firms alone for Disputes (International & Cross-Border) | Global of US firms confirms this notion  putting Covington well down on the list. I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views.Even though von der Leyen and her fellow conspirators are laboring mightily to get her long-sought “seize not freeze” scheme across the line  note the Politico signposting: Groundhog Day. They are of the view this will be another episode of motion playing at progress.But even then  simply keeping the matter in play bolsters Zelensky domestically  as in continuing to keep alive the fantasy that there will be more money and weapons for Ukraine. European leaders are as committed as every to fighting to the last Ukrainian._____1 BlackRock never committed to invest in this scheme  contrary to some claims.2 The total amount reported has varied  in part because the EU has been stealing the interest  and some accounts may include the assets of sanctioned Russian entities and individuals along with the central bank holdings.

54157,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629333-eu-backers-russian-assets-war-belgium/,EU backers of Russian asset theft are ‘psychologically at war’ – Belgian PM,Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has accused the EU backers of stealing Russia’s assets of being “mentally” at war with Russia Read Full Article at RT.com,Bart De Wever earlier denounced the European Commission’s plan to ‘steal’ the frozen fundsThe EU states pushing hardest to tap Russia’s frozen assets are acting as if they are “psychologically at war” with Moscow  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has said.Speaking after condemning the latest EU proposal to use the frozen Russian sovereign funds to help finance Ukraine  De Wever labeled the plan “very unwise and ill-considered.” He also warned that the plan backed by European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen would amount to “stealing” and would open the bloc up to potential legal action.Von der Leyen last week proposed providing Ukraine with €90 billion over the next two years  anchored by a so-called “reparations loan” backed by the frozen assets  or by debt financed by EU member states  deemed politically unworkable by most.Belgium  which hosts the financial clearinghouse Euroclear  where the bulk of Russia’s immobilized central bank assets are held  has long resisted such efforts. Brussels argues that forcing Euroclear to make the funds available could carry severe legal  financial and geopolitical risks.De Wever also argued that the strongest supporters of the proposal are EU states geographically closest to Russia  claiming they “mentally are almost in a state of war” with Moscow. He stressed that Belgium is “not at war” with Russia and doesn’t want to “have a war with Russia.”The Baltic states (Latvia  Lithuania  and Estonia) and Poland have become the EU’s most vocal advocates of a hard line toward Russia  warning of what they claim is an imminent threat.Meanwhile  Politico has reported that EU leaders are considering politically sidelining De Wever if he continues to block the plan. Belgium could be treated like Hungary – frozen out of key talks  ignored in negotiations and given little influence over future EU decisions – unless it backs down  the outlet claimed  citing a source.“The Belgian leader would be frozen out and ignored  just like Hungary’s Viktor Orban has been given the cold shoulder over… his refusal to play ball on sanctioning Russia ” one diplomat told the outlet  adding that Belgium’s views on EU proposals would no longer be sought and phone calls would go unanswered.,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['Russian asset theft', 'EU backers', 'Belgian PM', 'war', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'President Ursula von Der Leyen', 'potential legal action', 'next two years', 'severe legal, financial', 'The Baltic states', 'future EU decisions', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'financial clearinghouse Euroclear', 'central bank assets', 'EU member states', 'latest EU proposal', 'Belgian leader', 'EU states', 'EU leaders', 'EU proposals', 'European Commission', 'frozen funds', 'reparations loan', 'frozen assets', 'geopolitical risks', 'strongest supporters', 'vocal advocates', 'hard line', 'imminent threat', 'key talks', 'little influence', 'Viktor Orban', 'cold shoulder', 'one diplomat', 'phone calls', 'plan', 'war', 'Moscow', 'finance', 'Ukraine', 'bloc', 'debt', 'Belgium', 'bulk', 'efforts', 'Brussels', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania', 'Estonia', 'Poland', 'Politico', 'Hungary', 'negotiations', 'outlet', 'source', 'refusal', 'ball', 'views']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,rt.com
54158,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/629307-us-eu-divided-russian-assets/,US and EU divided over Russian assets – WSJ,Kiev’s European backers and the US are clashing over how to use Russian assets frozen in the West  the Wall Street Journal reports Read Full Article at RT.com,Washington reportedly wants to invest the money in business  while Brussels insists on using it to further arm KievThe US and Kiev’s European backers are divided on what to do with the billions in Russian assets frozen in the West  the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Kiev’s backers froze about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022  with the bulk held at Belgium-based Euroclear and the rest in other G7 jurisdictions.A divisive debate has raged between Western nations and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen who support a so-called ‘reparations loan’ to arm Kiev using Russia’s funds as collateral  and bloc members who vehemently oppose the plot  citing international law and exposure to extreme risk. Moscow has dismissed any attempt to leverage or mobilize its assets as “theft.”According to the WSJ  the US has waded into the debate with a proposal to invest the funds in business ventures in Ukraine  including a large data center powered by the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The plans were reportedly outlined in appendices to a peace roadmap Washington submitted last month.Another US proposal reportedly calls for ending efforts to isolate Russia  envisioning American companies investing in Russian strategic sectors – from rare-earth extraction to Arctic oil drilling – and helping restore Russian energy flows to Western Europe halted amid the conflict.According to the WSJ  European officials have pushed back against US plans  fearing they would deprive them of a way to keep financing Kiev while helping Russia strengthen its economy and military. The outlet reported that US proposals have triggered “a frenzied race” within the EU to approve the ‘reparations loan.’ Member states are expected to decide next week  but the plan faces strong opposition  with Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever calling it tantamount to “stealing” Russian money. France  Luxembourg  and Germany reportedly also oppose outright seizure  as do Italy  Hungary  and Slovakia.Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western plans to tap its sovereign assets as illegal. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said this week that Russia will retaliate against any expropriation and has prepared a response. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday declined to comment on the alleged US plans to use the frozen funds. Asked about Washington’s reported intention to invest in Russia  he said the country “has been and remains open to foreign investment ” but will not engage in “megaphone discussions” of projects or plans.,neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'WSJ', 'European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant', 'Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Wall Street Journal', 'other G7 jurisdictions', 'large data center', 'Arctic oil drilling', 'Russian strategic sectors', 'Russian energy flows', 'alleged US plans', 'European officials', 'European backers', 'Russian assets', 'foreign investment', 'Russian money', 'sovereign assets', 'The US', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'Western nations', 'reparations loan', 'bloc members', 'international law', 'extreme risk', 'peace roadmap', 'American companies', 'rare-earth extraction', 'Western Europe', 'US proposals', 'frenzied race', 'Member states', 'strong opposition', 'outright seizure', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'megaphone discussions', 'Western plans', 'divisive debate', 'business ventures', 'frozen funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Washington', 'Brussels', 'Kiev', 'billions', 'Wednesday', 'escalation', 'bulk', 'rest', 'collateral', 'plot', 'exposure', 'Moscow', 'attempt', 'WSJ', 'appendices', 'efforts', 'way', 'financing', 'economy', 'military', 'outlet', 'France', 'Luxembourg', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'expropriation', 'response', 'Thursday', 'intention', 'country', 'projects']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,rt.com

I think that's an appropriate thing to do "" said Mr Harris.The Tánaiste said that EU finance ministers will this evening discuss a reparations loan mechanism for Ukraine.""It's absolutely important that we work out  as a European Union  a mechanism as to how we're going to support Ukraine "" said Mr Harris.""That mechanism has to do two things. It has to fundamentally support Ukraine for here and now  because the funding need is urgent. But secondly  it has to also make sure that Russia pays.""A European Commission plan envisages that EU member states would issue a reparations loan of €165 billion to Ukraine from frozen Russian central bank assets  held at Euroclear  a Belgian-based securities depository.Those funds have been held at Euroclear since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Belgium has opposed the Commission’s plan to seize the funds on the basis that it might be held solely liable at a future date to repay the Russian funds.Instead  the Belgian government wants the legal and financial risks of seizing Russian assets to fund Ukraine to be shared by all EU member states.Under the Commission’s plan  Euroclear would lend a sum equivalent to the value of the frozen Russian assets as a zero-interest reparations loan to Ukraine.That loan would be used to cover Ukraine’s budgetary and defence needs for the next two years and would be guaranteed by EU member states.It would be comprised of about €140bn held by Euroclear and an additional €25bn in frozen Russian assets currently held across the EU.Speaking to reporters in Brussels  Mr Harris said that Ireland’s contribution to the loan guarantee mechanism would amount to between 2% and 2.15% of the total value of the loan.If the reparation loan ends up being valued at €165bn (a conservative estimate)  then that would mean Ireland would guarantee about €3.3bn of the loan's value.""This is a loan system where really the European Union acts in many ways  as a backstop  as a guarantee. It underwrites the risk  because it is important to get support to Ukraine in the here and now "" said Mr Harris.A survey commissioned earlier this year by Ukraine's government  the World Bank  the European Commission and the United Nations put the cost of reconstructing Ukraine in excess of €500bn.Ukraine would be liable to repay the loan if Russia stops its invasion and starts repaying reparations to Kyiv.The Kremlin has previously said that it would regard the use of its assets to fund Ukraine as theft.Watch: Europe will take measures in coming days to immobilise Russian assets  says HarrisEarlier  the Tánaiste began his two-day programme with a bilateral meeting with EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis  who has responsibility for the Economy and Productivity.He was also due to meet the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB)  Nadia Calvino  to discuss key objectives set out in Ireland's National Development Plan (NDP)  including large scale strategic infrastructure projects.The Tánaiste and other Eurozone finance ministers will attend the December meeting of the Eurogroup  where ministers will elect a new Eurogroup President by secret ballot.Belgium's Vincent Van Peteghem and Greece's Kyriakos Pierrakakis are running to replace Paschal Donohoe - who resigned last month to take up a post with the World Bank.Mr Pierrakakis has been in charge of Greece's finances since March  after earlier stints as minister of digital governance and education.Mr Van Peteghem  a staunch advocate for fiscal consolidation in a country with one of the worst debt ratios in the eurozone  has looked after Belgium's financial matters since 2020  serving in two successive coalition governments.The Eurogroup will also officially launch the nomination process for the post of European Central Bank (ECB) vice-president.Spaniard Luis de Guindos  the incumbent  is due to end his term at the Frankfurt-based institution in May next year.The Tánaiste will also attend the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Board of Governors Meeting  while tonight he will attend an informal dinner of ECOFIN ministers  which will focus on the European Commission's recent reparations loan proposal for Ukraine.The main item on the agenda for the ECOFIN meeting tomorrow will be a discussion on the flagship EU Financial Services Policy  the Savings and Investment Union which is due to be a major part of Ireland’s EU Presidency next year.Additional reporting AFP",neutral,0.08,0.83,0.09,mixed,0.21,0.22,0.57,True,English,"['Tánaiste', ""longer-term' freezing"", 'Russian asset', 'large scale strategic infrastructure projects', 'flagship EU Financial Services Policy', 'Spaniard Luis de Guindos', 'EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis', 'two successive coalition governments', 'recent reparations loan proposal', 'other Eurozone finance ministers', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Financial Affairs Council', 'EU member states', 'Belgian-based securities depository', 'next two years', 'Vincent Van Peteghem', 'worst debt ratios', 'European Central Bank', 'EU finance ministers', 'Mr Van Peteghem', 'The Tánaiste', 'National Development Plan', 'European Investment Bank', 'zero-interest reparations loan', 'European Stability Mechanism', 'reparations loan mechanism', 'new Eurogroup President', 'loan guarantee mechanism', 'European Commission plan', 'two things', 'financial risks', 'financial matters', 'EU Presidency', 'World Bank', 'The Kremlin', 'Investment Union', 'The Eurogroup', 'European Union', 'Russian assets', 'Eurogroup ministers', 'ECOFIN ministers', 'Mr Pierrakakis', 'reparation loan', 'loan system', 'Mr Harris', 'big focus', 'two-day visit', 'appropriate thing', 'funding need', 'future date', 'defence needs', 'conservative estimate', 'many ways', 'United Nations', 'coming days', 'two-day programme', 'Nadia Calvino', 'key objectives', 'secret ballot', 'Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'Paschal Donohoe', 'earlier stints', 'digital governance', 'staunch advocate', 'fiscal consolidation', 'nomination process', 'Frankfurt-based institution', 'ESM) Board', 'informal dinner', 'main item', 'major part', 'Additional report', 'Simon Harris', 'first meeting', 'bilateral meeting', 'December meeting', 'Governors Meeting', 'longer-term basis', 'Russian funds', 'full-scale invasion', 'Belgian government', 'ECOFIN meeting', 'total value', 'measures', 'Brussels', 'Ukraine', 'today', 'discussions', 'meetings', 'Economic', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'start', 'February', 'Belgium', 'legal', 'sum', 'budgetary', 'reporters', 'Ireland', 'contribution', 'backstop', 'support', 'survey', 'cost', 'excess', 'Kyiv.', 'use', 'theft', 'Watch', 'responsibility', 'Economy', 'Productivity', 'EIB', 'NDP', 'Greece', 'post', 'charge', 'finances', 'March', 'education', 'country', 'vice-president', 'incumbent', 'May', 'agenda', 'Savings', '€']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,rte.ie

The proposals have sparked tense negotiations between the United States and Europe  the newspaper added. Specifically  the US plans reportedly include US investments in Russian oil production in the Arctic and rare earth metal extraction  as well as restoring the previous system for delivering Russian energy resources to Europe and global markets. Ukraine's reconstruction is expected to be carried out by US companies  funded by $200 billion in frozen Russian assets  the report said. US negotiators told the newspaper that European plans to use the frozen assets would deplete funds too quickly  while the US strategy focuses on investing Russian assets and growing them. European officials gave mixed reactions to the proposals  according to the report. One source likened the plans to Trump's remarks about transforming the Gaza Strip into a Middle Eastern riviera after the war. Another compared the proposed energy deals between Russia and the US to the Yalta Conference in 1945. Since mid-November  the US has been promoting a new peace proposal for Ukraine. On December 2  Russian President Vladimir Putin received US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law  Jared Kushner  in the Kremlin. The US representatives' visit to Russia was related to the discussion of the US peace plan for Ukraine. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the European Union and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros ($350 billion). Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly in Euroclear  a Belgium-based securities depository. The Kremlin has maintained that any attempts to confiscate Russian assets amount to theft and are a violation of international law.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251208/new-us-national-security-strategy-appealing-to-russia-focuses-on-dialogue---kremlin-1123255191.htmlrussiaukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaladministration of us president donald trump  documents to european counterparts outlining plans  economic recovery of ukraine  restoration of economic ties with russia after the conflict,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['US Shares', 'Economic Ties', 'Proposals', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'Reports', 'russia ukraine ties bilateral ties diplomatic ties', 'The Wall Street Journal newspaper', 'political ties trade ties', 'rare earth metal extraction', ""The US representatives' visit"", 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Middle Eastern riviera', 'new peace proposal', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Belgium-based securities depository', 'Russian oil production', 'US special envoy', 'US peace plan', 'Russian energy resources', 'several one-page proposals', 'Economic Ties', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian assets', 'energy deals', 'US Shares', 'US investments', 'US companies', 'US negotiators', 'US strategy', 'Sputnik International', 'European counterparts', 'economic recovery', 'recent weeks', 'late Wednesday', 'tense negotiations', 'United States', 'previous system', 'global markets', 'frozen assets', 'European officials', 'mixed reactions', 'One source', 'Gaza Strip', 'Yalta Conference', 'Steve Witkoff', 'Jared Kushner', 'military operation', 'European Union', 'G7 nations', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'European accounts', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'US plans', 'Trump administration', 'international law', 'European plans', 'sputnikglobe', 'economic-ties', 'reports', 'documents', 'restoration', 'conflict', 'world', 'cdn1.', 'Arctic', 'reconstruction', 'funds', 'remarks', 'war', 'mid-November', 'December', 'son', 'discussion', 'start', 'half', 'Euroclear', 'attempts', 'theft', 'violation', 'national-security-strategy', 'focuses', 'dialogue', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,sputnikglobe.com
54161,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629321-eu-steal-russian-assets/,The EU rolls up in its clown car to rob a bank ‘for Ukraine’,Handing Russian assets over to Ukraine would be nothing more than theft disguised as a moral choice and a public service Read Full Article at RT.com,Handing Russian assets over to Ukraine would be nothing more than theft disguised as a moral choice and a public serviceMemo to the unelected Eurobozos of the European Union’s executive branch 'responsible' for setting policy: just because you keep calling a pile of cash you’re hell-bent on handing over to Ukraine a “loan” doesn’t mean it actually is.No one in their right mind would lend you money right now. Which is why you’re stealing it from taxpayers  or from Russia. Even your own European Central Bank is calling the whole thing a “stretch”.Maybe an analogy will help illustrate how unhinged this plan is. Imagine the average European walking into a bank with a little dude in a hoodie and cargo pants and saying  “He’d like a $100 billion loan  please.” The manager hands the kid a set of crayons they give out for free  laughs until their cheeks cramp  then asks: “How’s his repayment history? His credit score? His job prospects? Any pay stubs? Anything?”If all that checks out  maybe they hand him a few bucks. Probably pulled from the Monopoly board game in the lunchroom. Because a real bank must avoid tanking the financial system. But when you’re an institution of global governance  you can basically waltz in and rob the place. Or at least pretend you’re not doing exactly that.Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky is now at the loan counter with his EU helicopter parents insisting that not just one bank  but an entire cluster of them fork over billions through Euroclear.So let’s check his creditworthiness  shall we?His 'job' consists of globe-trotting and begging for cash. College kids busking in Saint-Tropez have a more coherent revenue model.On the due diligence front  he spent the summer denouncing Ukrainian institutional oversight as Russian meddling  then clutching his hoodie strings in shock when pals and top associates were accused of flushing foreign cash down golden toilets.As for repaying existing debt  reports last month suggested that the EU feared the International Monetary Fund wouldn’t even consider giving Kiev an $8 billion loan without Brussels co-signing it.And when the World Bank 'gave' Ukraine $545 million recently  the money was effectively handed to France – specifically multinational Alstom – to manufacture trains for Ukrainian Railways.Kind of like when your grandma gives you Christmas money by handing it directly to your parents so you don’t blow it all on candy and video games.What about Ukraine’s actual credit score? According to the latest Fitch ratings  the country is in default. “Ukraine missed a $665 million payment on $2.6 billion of GDP warrants on 2 June and a 10-day grace period expired without payment ” the agency noted.Try missing your car or mortgage payments and see how that goes. But if you’re Ukraine  you just keep 'borrowing' cash from Europeans  and Brussels trips over itself trying to bend the law to make it happen. Plan A is stealing Russian piggy-bank cash entrusted to EU institutions. Then praying that Moscow shrugs it off as the price of victory  even after the EU and West bragged that their own goal was to destroy Russia’s economy with sanctions. Lucky for Europe that they’re so consistently bad at hitting their targets and still have cash hanging around to treat it like a fiver lost and found in the couch cushions.Meanwhile  Team Trump is working on a Russia peace deal focused on making money rather than burning it. What’s stopping Europe from doing the same? Ideology. They’d rather stay broke clinging to a failing Ukraine strategy than pursue long-term peace through shared economic interest.They’ve brainwashed themselves into a foreign-aid 'feel-good' spending trance  buoyed by their own delusions of moral superiority. And they don’t care about consequences because none of these jokers will be around to face them when everything blows up and the repo man comes knocking after violations of international finance law.When was the last time EU execs or bureaucrats were held accountable for anything? Dodging checks and balances seems like part of their job description at this point. Look at 'Queen' Ursula von der Leyen’s infamous disappearing text messages with the Pfizer CEO during COVID  which were followed by such a tsunami of unused anti-COVID jabs that landfills across Europe are now sparkling with expired doses. Then she stonewalled when justice came sniffing around.More recently  former top EU diplomat Federica Mogherini was recently arrested by Belgian police on allegations of dodgy handling of EU funds tied to procurement at the College of Europe  where she now works.“I have full confidence in the justice system ” she said. Perhaps that’s because it’s repeatedly proven itself powerless against people like her.Whatever their screw-ups  their own taxpayers – not Russia – are always the last ones left at the table to settle the bill after an establishment dine-and-dash.Not that corruption isn’t baked into conflict zones and their reconstruction. Only the naive think otherwise. Corporate corruption can also pick others’ pockets  as we saw in post-war Afghanistan.

Read full story,"MOSCOW  Dec 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission has proposed an unprecedented use of about 210 billion euros of frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine.Russia  which does not hold significant sovereign assets of any EU nation except for diplomatic real estate  has said such a move would be an act of theft and warned of ""the harshest reaction"". Outlined below are potential things Russia could do in response to any EU decision:SEIZING FROZEN FOREIGN PRIVATE FUNDSAccording to former President Dmitry Medvedev  Russia has about $300 billion of frozen foreign assets in so-called ""C-type"" accounts created in March 2022 in response to Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.There is no official data on the total amount held in these accounts.The depositary ""C-type"" accounts hold Russian securities owned by investors from countries Russia considers ""unfriendly""  including stock in Russian companies as well as corporate and sovereign bonds.Ordinary ""C-type"" accounts accumulate cash and proceeds from these securities  such as dividends and coupon payments.Russia’s Sberbank estimated that 25% of its 787 billion roubles ($9.9 billion) dividend on shares owned by foreigners for 2024 was paid into ""C-type"" accounts.Some Russian officials and business leaders have warned that Russian action in this area could provoke another round of seizures  with EU countries targeting the private property of Russian citizens in Europe.SEIZING EU INVESTORS' PHYSICAL ASSETSEU private investors still hold significant assets in Russia  the most prominent examples being local Russian banks owned by Austria’s Raiffeisen and Italy’s UniCredit.Such assets often generate substantial profits in roubles from local operations  which the owners cannot repatriate.Raiffeisen  for example  reported 83.9 billion roubles ($1 billion) in net profit from its Russian unit in the first half of 2025. The unit  which operates as a Russian bank  is free to manage the funds as it wishes.Local subsidiaries of international businesses often choose to hold proceeds from their operations in deposits at the central bank  earning interest close to the key rate  currently 16.5%.There is no general estimate of the total value of physical assets still held in Russia by EU investors. The central bank estimated the total value of foreign direct investment from the EU at $364 billion at the start of 2022.Since then  many EU companies have left Russia or had their assets seized by the government and handed over to new owners. Russian lawyers told Reuters that seizing physical assets is far more complex than targeting assets in ""C-type"" accounts.50 YEARS OF LITIGATIONThe CEO of Russia's second-largest bank VTB  Andrei Kostin  said in an interview with Reuters that Moscow could unleash half a century of litigation if the EU proceeds with its plans.He said Russia could sue the EU  Belgium and Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear over the assets in Russian and international courts and also suggested a lawsuit in the United Nations' court.Russian lawyers told Reuters that such lawsuits could be complemented by multiple legal actions from private individuals against European states and entities.($1 = 79.2500 roubles)(Writing by Gleb Bryanski; Editing by Alex Richardson)",neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,mixed,0.17,0.24,0.59,True,English,"['EU decision', 'frozen assets', 'Factbox', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'SEIZING FROZEN FOREIGN PRIVATE FUNDS', 'former President Dmitry Medvedev', ""EU INVESTORS' PHYSICAL ASSETS"", 'foreign direct investment', 'diplomatic real estate', 'Brussels-based financial institution', ""United Nations' court"", 'multiple legal actions', 'The European Commission', 'half a century', 'largest bank VTB', 'EU private investors', 'many EU companies', 'local Russian banks', 'significant sovereign assets', 'Ordinary ""C-type"" accounts', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'foreign assets', 'private property', 'private individuals', 'sovereign bonds', 'significant assets', 'Russian companies', 'first half', 'European states', 'Local subsidiaries', 'central bank', 'EU nation', 'EU decision', 'Such assets', 'Russian officials', 'Russian action', 'Russian citizens', 'Russian lawyers', 'unprecedented use', '210 billion euros', 'harshest reaction', 'potential things', 'Western sanctions', 'official data', 'total amount', 'coupon payments', 'business leaders', 'prominent examples', 'substantial profits', 'net profit', 'international businesses', 'key rate', 'general estimate', 'total value', 'Andrei Kostin', 'international courts', 'Gleb Bryanski', 'Alex Richardson', 'local operations', 'EU countries', 'Russian securities', 'Russian unit', '787 billion roubles', '83.9 billion roubles', 'new owners', '79.2500 roubles', 'MOSCOW', 'Reuters', 'Ukraine', 'move', 'theft', 'response', 'March', 'war', 'stock', 'corporate', 'cash', 'proceeds', 'dividends', 'Sberbank', 'shares', 'foreigners', 'area', 'round', 'seizures', 'Austria', 'Raiffeisen', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'deposits', 'interest', 'start', 'government', '50 YEARS', 'LITIGATION', 'CEO', 'interview', 'plans', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'lawsuit', 'entities', 'Editing']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,thestar.com.my

The two main contenders for the position—the Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis and his Belgian counterpart Vincent Van Peteghem—will have to wait until the afternoon for the result of the crucial vote  for which EU diplomats and officials have expressed widely divergent and at times contradictory predictions.The 20 finance ministers of the eurozone  who make up the Eurogroup  will begin gathering in Brussels at 15:00 Greek time  while the meeting will start about two hours later. Shortly afterward  roughly halfway through the session  the voting process will begin  after which everyone will know whether the fifth president in the history of the club of EU member states that use the euro as their official currency will be elected in the first round or whether a “second round” will be required.To secure the presidency—whether Mr. Pierrakakis or Mr. Van Peteghem  both of whom come from the center-right European People’s Party (EPP)  which dominates the EU political scene—a simple majority is sufficient. This means that 11 votes out of the total 20 will be needed to determine whether the next Eurogroup president will come from Greece or Belgium. It cannot be ruled out that if no majority emerges for either candidate  the one with fewer votes may be asked to step aside  allowing the Eurogroup to unanimously appoint the new president. This has happened in the past.In 2017  Portugal’s Mário Centeno was elected after three rounds of voting  while in 2020 Ireland’s Paschal Donohoe was elected Eurogroup president in the second round  defeating Spain’s Nadia Calviño  who had been considered the clear favorite.The factors that will influence the resultThe EPP has six votes (Belgium  Greece  Ireland  Latvia  Luxembourg  and Portugal)  and therefore the process is not expected to be determined solely by political criteria and alignments within the European political groups  but also by current geopolitical developments.Belgium strongly opposes attempts by the European Commission and many other EU member states to use “frozen” Russian assets held in EU financial institutions to finance Ukraine  which urgently needs economic support. Around €185 billion in frozen Russian assets are held by Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial depository  while another €25 billion are in institutions in other member states  such as France  Sweden  and Cyprus.The Belgian government worries it may ultimately be forced to return the funds to Moscow if Russia challenges the asset freeze in Belgian courts or if sanctions against Russia are not renewed. Belgium’s stance has annoyed several EU member states  particularly the Baltic countries—Lithuania  Estonia  and Latvia—all of which belong to the eurozone and thus hold a vote in the Eurogroup.However  several supporters of Mr. Van Peteghem turn this argument around  claiming that granting the Eurogroup presidency to Belgium could be an effective way to soften the country’s resistance to using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s needs.On the other hand  awarding the Eurogroup presidency to the Greek Finance Minister Mr. Pierrakakis would send a clear message in every direction  as it would signify that the “treatment” imposed on Greece after the financial crisis worked—bringing the country from the brink of being forced out of the eurozone to the point where it now presides over it.A comparison between Belgium and Greece in terms of public debt and fiscal policy—which would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago—shows that Greece’s outlook is now more favorable. According to Eurostat data  Greece’s debt-to-GDP ratio is declining thanks to strong growth and surpluses  while Belgium’s remains high (around 107% of GDP) and may surpass Greece’s by the end of the decade if its deficits are not controlled.The “musical chairs” in Brussels and FrankfurtThe first task of the new Eurogroup president—whoever is elected—will be to initiate the process for the so-called “musical chairs ” as several important seats on the board of the European Central Bank will change hands in the coming months  and the eurozone finance ministers will need to agree on the succession. The first expected to leave Frankfurt next May is the ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos of Spain  followed shortly by Ireland’s Philip Lane. The ECB President Christine Lagarde has repeatedly urged member states to nominate more women to fill these positions. In this context  another name from Greece has been mentioned as a possible successor to Vice-President de Guindos: that of Ms. Christina Papakonstantinou  Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece. However  her chances will undoubtedly depend on whether Mr. Pierrakakis will preside over the Eurogroup for at least the next 2.5 years.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.03,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Ballot time', 'Van Peteghem', 'Pierrakakis', 'battle', 'Eurogroup', 'procedure', 'factors', 'result', 'ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos', 'The ECB President Christine Lagarde', 'many other EU member states', 'Greek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'several EU member states', 'Vice-President de Guindos', 'other member states', 'two main contenders', 'Vincent Van Peteghem', 'EU political scene', 'Mário Centeno', 'Nadia Calviño', 'current geopolitical developments', 'frozen” Russian assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'several important seats', 'Ms. Christina Papakonstantinou', 'center-right European People', 'Brussels-based financial depository', 'European political groups', 'Mr. Van Peteghem', 'EU financial institutions', 'European Central Bank', 'next Eurogroup president', 'new Eurogroup president', 'eurozone finance ministers', 'EU diplomats', '20 finance ministers', '15:00 Greek time', 'new president', 'other hand', 'Mr. Pierrakakis', 'The EPP', 'several supporters', 'fifth president', 'European Commission', 'political criteria', 'financial crisis', 'next 2.5 years', 'final battle', 'powerful “conclave', 'Belgian counterpart', 'contradictory predictions', 'official currency', 'first round', 'second round', 'three rounds', 'Paschal Donohoe', 'economic support', 'Belgian government', 'asset freeze', 'Belgian courts', 'Baltic countries', 'effective way', 'clear message', 'public debt', 'fiscal policy', 'Eurostat data', 'strong growth', 'musical chairs', 'first task', 'coming months', 'Philip Lane', 'possible successor', 'Deputy Governor', 'fewer votes', 'six votes', 'crucial vote', 'simple majority', 'GDP ratio', 'Eurogroup presidency', 'voting process', '11 votes', 'Newsroom', 'informal', 'position', 'afternoon', 'result', 'officials', 'divergent', 'times', 'meeting', 'session', 'everyone', 'history', 'club', 'Party', 'total', 'Greece', 'Belgium', 'candidate', 'past', 'Portugal', 'Ireland', 'Spain', 'factors', 'Latvia', 'Luxembourg', 'alignments', 'attempts', 'Ukraine', 'Euroclear', 'France', 'Sweden', 'Cyprus', 'funds', 'Moscow', 'sanctions', 'stance', 'Lithuania', 'Estonia', 'argument', 'country', 'needs', 'direction', 'treatment', 'brink', 'point', 'comparison', 'terms', 'outlook', 'surpluses', 'decade', 'deficits', 'Frankfurt', 'board', 'hands', 'succession', 'women', 'context', 'name', 'chances']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,en.protothema.gr

Credit: T. Schneider/Shutterstock.com.Dutch insurer Aegon has outlined plans to relocate its headquarters and legal domicile to the US as part of a broader strategy to prioritise life insurance and retirement operations in the region.This decision follows a review process announced in August 2025 and was shared during the company’s recent capital markets day.The company intends to adopt US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for its financial reporting  starting with full-year 2027 results.To accommodate this shift  from 2026 through 2027  Aegon will stop issuing trading updates and will instead provide half-year reports only.With the relocation set for completion by 1 January 2028  Aegon’s holding company will be rebranded as Transamerica.The common stock of Transamerica is expected to continue trading on both Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange after the change.GlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic IntelligenceThe existing business units are expected to retain their current branding.Before this transition takes effect  Aegon plans to call a meeting in the fourth quarter of 2026 to secure shareholder approval for moving its legal domicile to the US.Consistent with efforts to reduce capital allocated to older blocks of business  Aegon plans to reinsure a portion of its secondary guarantee universal life (SGUL) contracts.This agreement will cover 30% of Transamerica’s SGUL business by face value  bringing the total covered under similar actions to 80% of the overall portfolio.Unwinding financing structures related to this transaction will introduce certain tax limitations and realised losses  which are expected to affect the risk-based capital (RBC) ratio.An $800m (€683.5m) investment into Transamerica is planned simultaneously  intended to offset this impact on the RBC ratio and support additional annual operating capital generation and remittances totalling $75m.Transamerica also aims to increase the total life sales of its affiliated network  World Financial Group (WFG)  by 14% each year  up to approximately $900m.WFG’s annual annuity sales are targeted to grow by 7% per year  reaching around $5bn in 2027.Further growth is anticipated in the Protection Solution business  with a goal of increasing life sales annually by 15%  up to roughly $720m in 2027.To enhance returns for shareholders and reach a target level of €1bn by the end of 2026  Aegon has announced a €400m share buyback programme split between early and late 2026.This buyback is scheduled to begin at the start of January 2026.Operating results are forecasted to rise by around 5% annually between 2025 and 2027  from €1.5bn to €1.7bn  based on an assumed €/$ exchange rate of 1.20. Growth is expected mainly from its US strategic assets.Aegon CEO Lard Friese said: “Today marks a historical moment in the transformation of our company. Over the past five years  we have successfully transformed Aegon into a strong  focused  well-performing group.“Now  we are ready for the next frontier: to fully capture the opportunities in the largest life insurance market in the world: the US. With Transamerica  which now represents around 70% of our operations  we are strongly positioned to serve a large and underserved segment: Main Street American families  and medium-sized companies. Aegon’s ambition is clear: we want to become a leading US life insurance and retirement group.”Recently  Ageas agreed to acquire the remaining 25% stake in Belgian subsidiary AG Insurance from BNP Paribas Fortis for €1.9bn  supporting its Elevate27 strategy.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.26,0.33,0.41,True,English,"['legal domicile', 'Aegon', 'headquarters', 'US', 'US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles', 'additional annual operating capital generation', 'Main Street American families', 'recent capital markets day', 'Belgian subsidiary AG Insurance', 'secondary guarantee universal life', 'largest life insurance market', 'New York Stock Exchange', '€400m share buyback programme', 'US GAAP accounting standards', 'risk-based capital (RBC) ratio', 'Aegon CEO Lard Friese', 'leading US life insurance', 'annual annuity sales', '€/$ exchange rate', 'Unwinding financing structures', 'past five years', 'BNP Paribas Fortis', 'US strategic assets', 'existing business units', 'Protection Solution business', 'total life sales', 'Dutch insurer Aegon', 'GlobalData Strategic Intelligence', 'World Financial Group', 'RBC ratio', 'Operating results', 'common stock', 'US Tariffs', 'retirement group', 'financial reporting', 'SGUL business', 'full-year 2027 results', 'T.

The alfapump System is the first active implantable medical device approved in the U.S. for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis that automatically and continuously removes ascites fluid from the abdomen into the bladder.These successful implantations at University of Pennsylvania follow the successful procedure at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and are further demonstration of the Company’s strategy of working with Key Opinion Leaders at top tier centers to establish alfapump as the new standard of care. Sequana Medical continues to make strong progress in the roll-out of this strategy with a growing pipeline of additional centers completing the necessary site approvals for implantation  and keen interest from both clinicians and patients supporting the commercial momentum.Recurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle. This procedure often needs to be repeated weekly or monthly  requiring frequent hospital visits and causing significant disruption to patients’ daily lives.1 Sequana Medical estimates there are approximately 70 000 patients in the U.S. with recurrent or refractory ascites  representing a market opportunity in excess of $2 billion for the alfapump  forecast to reach 130 000 patients and over $5 billion by 2035  primarily driven by NASH/MASH and alcoholic liver disease.2Ethan Weinberg MD  Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania  commented: “The alfapump represents a welcomed advancement for our patients suffering from recurrent ascites. With the alfapump system  patients can have ascites drained automatically and continuously avoiding the punctures and the hospital visits. This engineering marvel offers our patients the potential for improved quality of life  allowing them to get back to their daily lives.”Martijn Blom  Chief Commercial Officer of Sequana Medical  continued: “Today marks another big step forward in bringing alfapump to the patients who deserve it  with two patients treated on the same day at the University of Pennsylvania. Here is another top-tier US hospital with a strong reputation in hepatology and interventional radiology starting to implant the alfapump in a commercial setting  and we are proud to work alongside them to deliver this breakthrough device to patients that currently undergo repeated needle puncture paracentesis. alfapump is a twenty-first century solution for the large and growing patient population that has clear unmet clinical needs.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917Media Relations:Josephine GalatiotoICR HealthcareE: Sequana@icrhealthcare.comT: +1 (332) 242-4388Important Safety InformationIndication for Use: The alfapump® System is intended for single patient use only in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. It is indicated for the removal of excess peritoneal fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the bladder  where it can be eliminated through normal urination.Contraindications: MRI Safety Information: The alfapump® System is MRI unsafe. This diagnostic procedure is contraindicated due to possible movement of the alfapump®  damage to the pump circuitry  tissue damage in the vicinity of the alfapump® and/or catheter dislocation.

The safety and effectiveness of DSR® therapy has not been established.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical’s POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life3  4.Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.5 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

This revision also impacts Ontex’s adjusted EBITDA  free cash flow and leverage ratio expectations. The consumption of retailer brands dropped sequentially in the fourth quarter  both in Europe and North America  as consumer demand weakened further  and as promotional activity by A-brands remains intense.Based on the lower-than-expected sales volumes  Ontex now anticipates a high-single digit like-for-like revenue drop in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2024  whereas a largely stable performance had been expected  with newly gained contracts offsetting the soft market conditions. Ontex had planned for continued quarter-on-quarter improvement  so the revenue decrease impacted margin negatively and thereby amplified the short-term effect on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow delivery in the fourth quarter.Importantly  the new contracts  which started delivery in the third quarter  are now fully operational both in Europe and North America  albeit at lower volumes than anticipated. While growth in these contracts was not sufficient to compensate for the overall decline in consumer demand  it demonstrates that Ontex is well positioned to continue gaining market share.Ontex thereby revises its full year outlook  and now expects:Revenue to reduce by mid-single digit like for like (previously by low single digit);Adjusted EBITDA in a range of €175 to €180 million (previously €200 to €210 million)  representing a margin of around 10%;Free cash flow of around €(35) million (previously around zero);Leverage ratio to end at around 3.2x (previously around 2.5x).Given the evolving market environment and following the completion of the non-core business divestment  Ontex’s management is now accelerating an efficiency improvement initiative across operations and SG&A of €200 million over the next three years. The required one-off implementation costs are expected to remain below €40 million. The aim of the initiative is to strengthen Ontex’s competitiveness and support margin improvement and cash flow generation. More details will be shared in February with Ontex’s full year results and 2026 outlook publication.Gustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said: “Consumer demand has softened throughout the year  in particular for baby diapers in our key markets  which has led us to revise our full-year outlook. This is disappointing  especially as we have made strong progress on our strategic portfolio and operational transformation  and have been gaining contracts over the period. Maintaining a double-digit margin for 2025  while facing strong market headwinds  demonstrates  however  that Ontex has strengthened its foundations in the last years. Nevertheless  the current market conditions and recent results call for action  and we are thereby accelerating a three-year efficiency improvement initiative across operations and SG&A.”Management will host a Q&A session for investors and analysts today  December 11  2025 at 12:00 CET  11:00 BT.

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved two innovative Sanofi medicines for rare hematologic diseases: Qfitlia (fitusiran) for hemophilia and Cablivi (caplacizumab) for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These approvals mark another step in Sanofi’s long-term commitment to China  reinforcing the company’s ambition to bring transformative medicines across diverse disease areas. With Qfitlia and Cablivi  Sanofi reaches its fourth and fifth approvals in China this year  following Tzield for stage 2 type 1 diabetes and Sarclisa for two indications in relapsed and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.Qfitlia is the first antithrombin (AT)-lowering therapy for routine prophylaxis in people with hemophilia. Qfitlia is indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older  and adults with severe hemophilia A (coagulation factor VIII deficiency  FVIII<1%) with or without factor VIII inhibitors  or severe hemophilia B (coagulation factor IX deficiency  FIX<1%) with or without factor IX inhibitors.This approval is based on data from the ATLAS phase 3 studies that demonstrated clinically meaningful bleed protection as measured by annualized bleeding rates (ABR) across hemophilia patients with or without inhibitors. By lowering AT  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  Qfitlia helps increase thrombin generation to restore hemostasis in people with hemophilia. Qfitlia uses small-interfering RNA technology  which enables low treatment frequency  subcutaneous injections  and low-volume dosing. Hemophilia affects more than 40 000 people in China.Cablivi is the first Nanobody targeted therapy designed to treat acquired/immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP/iTTP) in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older weighing at least 40 kg.This approval brings an innovative medicine specifically indicated for this rare and life-threatening blood clotting disorder to China  where approximately 2700 patients are diagnosed annually. Despite standard treatments  aTTP/iTTP carries a mortality rate of up to 20%. Cablivi targets von Willebrand factor (vWF)  a protein in the blood involved in hemostasis  and is designed to inhibit the interaction between vWF and platelets. Used in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy  it helps by inhibiting the formation of microthrombi  which contribute to organ damage during the course of the disease.These two approvals expand Sanofi's rare hematology portfolio in China  addressing critical unmet needs across both chronic bleeding disorders and acute clotting emergencies.“Qfitlia represents a potentially transformative advancement for the hemophilia community in China  shifting care from treating bleeds as they occur to helping prevent them altogether. By offering effective bleed protection and simplified administration  Qfitlia has the potential to make prophylaxis more accessible for people with hemophilia worldwide ” said Brian Foard  Executive Vice President  Head of Specialty Care  Sanofi. “Cablivi addresses a critical unmet need for patients facing aTTP/iTTP. Together  these approvals highlight Sanofi's commitment to delivering meaningful innovation and improving outcomes for people living with rare diseases in China and around the world.”In the ATLAS clinical development program  Qfitlia demonstrated low bleed rates across subgroups with as few as six injections a year. Key results include:Significant bleed reduction by 71% in ABR for patients without inhibitors treated with Qfitlia prophylaxis compared to clotting factor concentrate on-demand (estimated mean: ABR 9.0 vs. 31.4  respectively; p<.0001) and by 73% in ABR compared to bypassing agent on-demand for patients with inhibitors (estimated mean: ABR 5.1 vs. 19.1  respectively; p<0.0006)Median observed ABR during the open-label extension study was 3.8 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.0–11.2) in patients without inhibitors and 1.9 (IQR: 0.0–5.6) in patients with inhibitorsNearly half of patients in the open-label extension study experienced one or fewer bleeds (47% 0-1 bleeds and 31% 0 bleeds)Nearly 80% of participants were on a regimen of six injections per year by the conclusion of the open-label extension study  and 94% achieved target AT levels with 0-1 dose adjustments“The approval of Qfitlia marks a true transition into a new era of non-factor prophylactic treatment for hemophilia in China. Requiring potentially just six subcutaneous injections annually  it significantly reduces disease burden  eliminating the need for frequent intravenous injections associated with traditional factor therapy ” said Sun Jing  Chief Physician of Hematology  Nanfang Hospital at Southern Medical University  Guangzhou  China. “By lowering antithrombin to restore coagulation balance  this innovation offers people living with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  a novel treatment option.”Serious thrombotic events  acute and recurrent gallbladder disease  and hepatotoxicity have occurred in Qfitlia-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are viral infection  nasopharyngitis  and bacterial infection.About hemophiliaHemophilia A and B are rare  congenital  lifelong  bleeding disorders in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and significantly impact quality of life. Hemophilia A and B are caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and IX  respectively  resulting in insufficient thrombin generation and ineffective clot formation  which is further complicated in people who develop inhibitors to their factor treatment.About aTTPAcquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP  also known as immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultra-rare life-threatening autoimmune-based blood clotting disorder characterized by extensive clot formation in small blood vessels throughout the body  leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count); microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (loss of red blood cells through destruction); ischemia (restricted blood supply to parts of the body); and widespread organ damage  especially in the brain and heart.About the ATLAS clinical development programThe efficacy and safety of Qfitlia is being investigated in the ATLAS clinical development program. The program includes completed phase 3 studies ATLAS-INH (clinical study identifier: NCT03417102)  ATLAS-A/B (clinical study identifier: NCT03417245)  and ATLAS-PPX (clinical study identifier: NCT03549871). There are three ongoing phase 3 studies ATLAS-NEO (clinical study identifier: NCT05662319)  ATLAS-PEDS (clinical study identifier: NCT03974113)  and ATLAS OLE (clinical study identifier: NCT03754790).The ongoing ATLAS-OLE study is a single-arm  phase 3  open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Qfitlia with a revised AT dosing regimen (AT-DR)  which was designed to maintain an AT target range of 15%-35% in patients who have completed a prior phase 3 ATLAS clinical trial. This study includes lower doses and less-frequent dosing than earlier studies of Qfitlia. The efficacy of Qfitlia AT-DR treatment was assessed by comparing the AT-DR treatment data from ATLAS-OLE to the control data from studies ATLAS-INH and ATLAS-A/B. The analyses follow the intent to treat principle.About QfitliaQfitlia (fitusiran) is a first-in-class AT-lowering therapy approved by the NMPA. Qfitlia prevents bleeds and helps rebalance hemostasis by lowering AT  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  to promote thrombin generation. Qfitlia is a small interference RNA therapeutic that utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Qfitlia on March 28  2025  for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients (aged 12 or older) with hemophilia A or B with or without factor VIII or IX inhibitors. Additional submissions for Qfitlia are under review with regulatory authorities around the world.About CabliviCablivi (caplacizumab) is a bivalent anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Nanobody VHH  used in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy  for the treatment of patients experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP)  also known as immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). Cablivi is the first and only treatment targeted to block the formation of microthrombi  small blood clots that form in the microvasculature  helping prevent organ damage. Cablivi is currently available in nearly 30 countries including the US  the EU  UK  Switzerland  Brazil  Colombia  Japan  and five Greater Gulf region states. Cablivi earned priority review for its approval in China  as well as priority review designation from the FDA for a pending label expansion to include the treatment of adolescents aged 12 years and older.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Twenty votes are “in play ” that is  as many as Pierr’s colleagues — the Ministers of Economy — including him. Opposite him is the Belgian Minister of Finance and his “stablemate” in the European People’s Party. Of course  there are predictions and assessments in our favor  but that doesn’t mean anything yet until this afternoon when the vote will take place — unless the Belgian resigns earlier if he sees he is losing  though no one knows or says anything about that. So  good luck to the Greek minister  because honestly  we repeat  it’s no small thing — after the curse of the previous decade for the country and the economy — to now take the presidency of the Eurogroup.M.M.’s ultimatum on the blockadesIt was no coincidence that Marinakis appeared yesterday (on Action24) to outline an ultimatum for dialogue addressed to the farmers  telling them to form a coordinating committee and come organized with demands. A possible day for a meeting with Mitsotakis or with the Hatzidakis–Tsiaras duo is considered to be Monday  provided of course that the farmers agree  since they have a “coordinating meeting” on Sunday. Nevertheless  even in M.M. they are concerned about how things are developing  since until now the issue was mainly with transportation on the national highways. As we get closer to Christmas  the situation changes  as there are complaints from tourist destinations — for example from the “Mill of Elves” in Trikala — while many more citizens will want to travel. So the government also feels the pressure to take an initiative to break the deadlock. Of course  the farmers too will feel this social pressure if they don’t respond to the call for dialogue  because everyone reasonably looks after their work and their own interests.Pre-holiday blue complaintsYesterday’s gathering at the ND offices with about 30 MPs in person and another 20 on Zoom to hear Tsiaras’ briefing again gave the “blue” officials a “temperature reading” ahead of Friday’s Parliamentary Group meeting. Complaints were heard — and quite a few — although the session was not as explosive as the one in mid-October under similar circumstances. But there are many complaints  mainly because MPs from rural regions are “getting beaten up” in the agricultural prefectures. I also note Voridis’s pointed jab  who blames the government (of which he was a member until recently) for lacking a strategy in handling the blockades. He implies that when he was in Maximos Mansion and handled the 2024 blockades  things went more smoothly. To be honest  I tried in good faith to follow the on-camera statements of the ND MPs and understand whether  beyond a logical irritation to show voters they care  there was any real justification. I single out Ms. Arampatzi’s statement  which honestly reminded me of that famous one by the president of Edessaikos. Good grief  people!Crisis and prayersSpeaking of Arampatzi  she almost monopolized attention at some point  as she cornered the poor president of OPEKEPE and attacked him relentlessly. At one point she even lashed out at her fellow MPs when they asked her not to be the only one talking. But Arampatzi was unstoppable  and so… Maria Antoniou from Kastoria got the brunt of it  when Arampatzi told her that if these things were happening in her prefecture  she too would be doing the same. Another revolutionary method heard for dealing with the problems was… prayer. “Unity and prayer ” said Evros MP Tasos Dimoschakis three times to calm tempers. As you can understand  we have a blue circus.The MP’s favor and OSEAn unbelievable and persistent favor requested by an ND MP has come onto the radar of Deputy Minister of Transport Konstantinos Kyranakis  I’m told. The MP from an Attica region  who generally “has an eye” on Kyranakis and also has sensitivities regarding taxis  is said to be persistently asking OSE — perhaps under the “brain gain” banner — to hire two of his own people from his electoral district. Not of course for them to do any actual work  but so he can “pull” them into his office  although I don’t know how legal all this is. In fact  a few days ago  his director even went to OSE in person to cause… a commotion. As you can imagine  the matter has reached Kyranakis  as OSE’s senior staff were stunned by the MP’s persistence.AdonisI read yesterday Adonis’s post commenting on the court’s conviction of the two Novartis “witnesses ” Destempassidis and Maraggelis  as guilty of perjury. I believe that he needed just a little more to be sitting next to Samaras and Venizelos at the event they attended  and I think the moment they all appear together somewhere is not far away. By the way  where is Mimi (Papaggelos)? Where is that soul?Code name: “finish Odysseas”Now let’s move a bit to the green news. Something President Nikos (of ours) does not want to hear lately is the name “Odysseas.” The first reason is that “Odysseas” reminds him of Ithaca and inevitably sends him toward unpleasant associations with Tsipras vying for the helm of the center-left. And the second reason is that Konstantinopoulos is also named Odysseas — and he recently threw  when asked about Tsipras  yet another jab at Androulakis: “If PASOK had 22%  Tsipras would at most write a book ” the Arcadia MP said  and no one (absolutely no one…) responded against him. Between us  is he wrong? I’m told some even suggested that Androulakis expel him. But since he understands the turmoil such a move would cause in the immovable PASOK  he preferred for the time being to move with the code: “finish Odysseas in Arcadia.” Which means our leader will try to block Konstantinopoulos’s re-election by seeking an “opposing force” for the ballot. If the two hardcore presidential loyalists (they smirk here) being mentioned — Vangelis Giannakouras and Kostas Papageorgiou — actually run  it’s quite likely that the “presidentials” will split and Odysseas will come out strong.Anna in the SouthAnna Diamantopoulou has made her decision and will run in Southern Athens. Fresh polls show Diamantopoulou far ahead in the southern district  but she also seems to lead in Northern Athens and Eastern Attica. In the southern district  if PASOK doesn’t “unstick the needle ” it elects one MP. The current MP is Pavlos Christidis  while former MP Tonia Antoniou will join the race again  as she has steady  concrete-like strength in the area. Most in PASOK predicted that Androulakis would place Anna on the nationwide list so she could campaign without limitations. But the president had other plans…Rural for Petros?Two MPs came from SYRIZA to PASOK to run in Thessaloniki A — and both made statements that caused turmoil at Harilaou Trikoupi. Rania Thraska proposed cooperation with Tsipras  and Petros Pappas praised Adonis Georgiadis for his work ethic at the ministry. Pappas “corrected” his statement as instructed by Harilaou Trikoupi  but he has likely not escaped the leader’s anger. The funny part is they told him it’s better if he doesn’t run in Thessaloniki A — where Thraska is — but in Halkidiki. The only connection Pappas has with Halkidiki is that he did his rural medical service there. Androulakis’s goal  of course  is to cut down the current Halkidiki MP Apostolos Panas  who supported Haris Doukas. What a lovely atmosphere  what a lovely party!Alexis in PatrasThe Royal Multipurpose Center is high on the list for events in Patras. It overlooks the new port of Patras  has an excellent surrounding area and balconies in the hall  which sometimes fills with people for concerts and other times hosts campaign speeches. It’s also good for book presentations  and yes — it even has balconies in the main hall. So  next Tuesday — when Kyriakos Mitsotakis will be taking the podium before the budget vote — our Alexis will hold his second event for “Ithaca” at the Royal. He chose Patras as his second “station ” not Thessaloniki  because the atmosphere is undeniably warmer than in Northern Greece. Tsipras has every reason to expect a large turnout in Patras  the seat of Western Greece  and for another significant reason: the SYRIZA regional organization has already turned toward supporting Tsipras’s initiative  while besides the Achaean MP Andreas Panayiotopoulos  MPs Dionysis Kalamatianos (Ilia) and Miltos Zabaras (Aetolia-Acarnania) have essentially already joined his camp. The MPs may be in Parliament next Tuesday for the budget vote  but their people will be heading toward the Royal. Tsipras’s bet is to mobilize the PASOK supporters — especially the Papandreou loyalists  who have a strong presence in the area but are sidelined or inactive because of Androulakis. Alexis wants to make a strong play in the home region of the other former prime minister  George Papandreou. But predictions insist that at the Patras event  the movement of PASOK officials toward the venue will be nonexistent.Silence in SYRIZAYesterday’s meeting of the parliamentary group ended with exercises in… muteness  since after the president  Sokratis Famellos  the floor was taken by the Finance Sector Head  Nikos Pappas  who spoke about the budget — which he knows very well  numbers and all. Then the speakers (Gavrilis  Notopoulou) and the parliamentary representative Christos Giannoulis spoke  and the session ended quickly and thus… bloodlessly  with Pavlos Polakis absent. You see  the Chania MP chose to intervene in a leadership manner on social media during Famellos’ speech  declaring himself “present” at the farmers’ blockades in Chania. After all  several SYRIZA MPs have already visited the blockades  but yesterday’s process was blocked by Tsipras’ team  which rushed from early morning to announce the new presentation of “Ithaki” — as we wrote  in Patras. Of course  President Famellos did leave a few hints yesterday about Alexis  bringing back the issues of “fragmentation and petty political calculations ” but this concerns MPs very little. The main problem many of them face lies in… the budget  since the vote takes place on Tuesday — the same day Tsipras is holding the Patras event — and they are already looking for a way to… teleport themselves.Giuseppe is ready…Now take two pieces of business news to start with. So  we told you that things were heating up for Piraeus Bank’s brokerage to acquire Euroxx  and… not a peep was heard  no denial  no move from the Capital Markets Commission (heaven forbid they be disturbed!). I’m told it’s a done deal and we’ll hear about it with the… bells of Christmas — you know  so there’s no fuss. Someone even told me the price  reportedly 40 million euros  but I don’t see Giuseppe letting it go that cheap. We wait  wishing him good profit.Direct award by EFKA – Who signs such things?The other rumor is that the job of “collecting the uncollected” of EFKA — about ten billion euros — will be awarded without a tender! And then another 40 million will be spent on the media so they stay silent… Who would be crazy enough to sign something like that? No one  the Maximos Mansion replies.New deal coming for EpsilonNetInformation indicates that Giannis Michos  founder and CEO of EpsilonNet  is in very advanced negotiations to sell a majority stake to the U.S.-origin fund HF Capital. This development comes just months after the “golden” €650 million deal that led EpsilonNet off the Athens Stock Exchange  with the participation of General Atlantic and National Bank. HF Capital  based on available data  has often acted as an advisor to tech companies on IPOs  mergers  and capital markets  providing alternative financing options in the growth capital sector. The structure and profile of the fund indicate expertise in business software and technological development. Market information suggests that Michos would not rule out transferring the company’s management to the new investor if discussions conclude successfully. Michos had agreed to retain control and leadership of EpsilonNet even after General Atlantic entered. EpsilonNet appears to be closing 2025 with turnover around €150 million. The group has announced an investment plan exceeding €100 million for the next five years  with emphasis on exports and acquisitions.Hatziminas’ major announcementsChristian Hatziminas has signed a major contract between the European intergovernmental organization OCCAR and the THEON/Hensoldt consortium for the supply of an additional 100 000 night-vision systems (NVGs) to the German Armed Forces and 4 000 NVGs to the Belgian Armed Forces. The new contract  including options  has a total value of around €1 billion and constitutes the largest single order for night-vision systems in NATO member-state history in Europe. THEON  listed on Euronext Amsterdam  is emerging as the largest supplier of night-vision systems in Europe  with a backlog of orders 2.3 times larger than the one announced at the beginning of the year. Next Tuesday  however  significant announcements will be made for Monte Christian’s EFA Group  with the entry of new investors and major investments of €120 million that are changing the game in Greece as well.The Sbokou sisters’ holdingsSisters Konstantza and Agapi Sbokou established two new holding companies yesterday. These companies relate to the family’s hotel group  Phāea Resorts  which owns luxury hotel complexes and villas in Crete  the family’s homeland. Konstantza Sbokou  president of Phāea Resorts and wife of Achilleas Konstantakopoulos  founded Phaedra’s Home Holding Single-Member IKE  headquartered at 46 Amalias Avenue (where TEMES offices are located)  with share capital of €53 918 851 divided into equal company shares of €1 each. She contributed €20 000 in cash and  as a non-cash contribution  provided 10 668 104 common voting shares of Phāea SA  valued at €53 898 851. Similarly  Agapi Sbokou  vice president and CEO of Phāea Resorts  founded Ariadne’s Thread Holding Single-Member IKE  headquartered at 6 Vasilissis Sofias Avenue  with identical share capital and structure  contributing €20 000 cash and the same number of Phāea shares valued at €53 898 851. It is recalled that Eftychis and Giorgos Vassilakis also sit on the board of Phāea Resorts.Fidelity is sellingThe official announcement of Athens Stock Exchange’s upgrade to a developed market by FTSE Russell on October 7  2025  and the pending completion of ATHEX’s acquisition by Euronext  have created a new situation for large funds investing exclusively in emerging markets. In recent days  we’ve seen Fidelity systematically reducing its holdings in JUMBO (below 5%)  TITAN (below 5%)  and Sarantis (below 10%). In our shallow pre-Christmas market  this systematic liquidation puts pressure on prices  thus creating buying opportunities for those who believe in the market’s prospects. Fidelity manages major emerging markets funds with strict mandates — they must track the MSCI Emerging Markets and FTSE Advanced Emerging indices. The upgrade becomes effective on 21 September 2026  offering a year-long adjustment window  unless done earlier. Meanwhile  Euronext has completed the acquisition of 74.25% of ATHEX Group and is preparing its full integration into the European network. While large Greek banks and blue chips will enter developed market indices  many small and medium-sized companies may be left out. This new landscape affects not only Fidelity but other major emerging markets funds as well.Frangou’s $1.9 billion shipbuilding programAngeliki Frangou continues undeterred with the shipbuilding program of her NYSE-listed company. The company manages a fleet of 171 ships — tankers  bulk carriers  and container ships — with carrying capacity of 15 million DWT and 287 243 TEU  with an average age of 9.7 years. A shipbuilding program is underway for 25 ships  23 of which will be delivered between 2026–27 and the remaining two in 2028. Of these  17 are tankers and eight are container vessels. The total value of the program amounts to $1.9 billion.Digital Lloyd’s Register and LatscoThe move by Britain’s classification society Lloyd’s Register and Latsco to test digital ship inspections is not just a technological exercise. It’s a shift that could affect the entire way shipping operates. Until now  inspectors had to be physically on board to check systems  safety  and compliance. With the new process  many of these checks can be performed remotely  based on real-time ship data. Technologically  this shows that telemetry and data analytics are no longer auxiliary but tools capable of replacing traditional  time-consuming procedures. For shipping  it’s like moving from workshop service… to remote “software-update-style” diagnostics. This evolution means two things: first  less downtime for ships and therefore lower costs  and second  more predictable and “clean” processes — something investors always like. Companies that adopt such technologies appear more efficient and modern. Simply put  shipping is starting to operate more like a high-tech sector. And that changes the game for everyone.New movesLatsco and Super Eco Tankers have been active on the shipbuilding front in recent days. Latsco exercised an option for two 50 000 dwt product tankers at the K Shipbuilding shipyard (Jinhae) in South Korea  for deliveries in 2027–2028. Super Eco Tankers of the Tomazou family proceeded with contracts for 2+1 tankers of 40 800 dwt at the Yangzhou Guoyu shipyard in China  at a price of about 40.3 million dollars per ship  for delivery in 2028. In the secondary (second-hand) market  Greek buyers were represented by Velos Shipping Co Ltd  which acquired the Kamsarmax KEY FRONTIER (80 679 dwt  2011  Universal Shipbuilding  Japan) at a price of 18.8 million dollars  with delivery scheduled between early February and early April 2026 and with SS/DD completed. Greek interests were also behind the sale of the MR UOG SYROS  with a capacity of 51 745 dwt and built in 2010.The “for-sale” signs and IntralotAnalysts who predicted sell-offs in the UK due to the sharp increase in taxation on online gambling (from 21% today to 40% from April 2026) are being proven right. The well-known Evoke group  owner of William Hill and 888 among others  has appointed financial advisors (Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co) to explore strategic options  including the sale of the group or the spin-off of part of its subsidiaries and activities. The group estimated that the tax increase will burden it by approximately 135 million pounds annually  undermining its profitability and viability. Evoke had acquired the network of 1 400 William Hill shops a few years ago  and as it significantly increased its leverage and has substantial exposure to the British market  it was considered the weak link in the sector. Analysts believe that the upheaval in the sector will lead to consolidation and expect significant reshuffling. For Intralot  S&P Global Ratings stated that the company has sufficient room to manage the recently announced tax hikes  as its profitability remains resilient. The company’s management has said that opportunities will arise in this new environment and has already announced aggressive measures to mitigate the tax impact  while it intends to pursue an increase in its market share in the UK.Dispersion placements before year-endThe share of EKTER returned to “normal” trading volumes yesterday after the latest wave of pre-agreed block trades through which 6% of the company was transferred to institutional investors. The process began with EYATH  with the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP/“Ypertameio”) selling 5% of its shares to institutional portfolios  followed by EKTER with a 6% placement  and next in line is ELTON. The new Athens Stock Exchange regulations require a minimum free float of 25% for companies with a market capitalization under €200 million  while for larger companies the threshold is 15%. EYATH  with a free float of just 21% and HCAP holding 24.02%  completed the placement of 1.815 million shares (5% of the share capital) on December 8. HCAP now retains 19%  and the free float comfortably exceeds 25%. EKTER followed two days later. The main shareholder  Athanasios Sipsas  disposed of 1.7 million shares to Greek and foreign institutional investors. ELTON  with the Papathanasiou family holding 78.17%  remains in the “red zone.” With a market capitalization under €200 million and a free float limited to 22%  the chemical products company has until January 2026 to restore its free float  otherwise it faces a “penalty ” meaning a transfer to the Surveillance category. Logically  this will not occur  as ELTON’s management is expected to complete its move soon.,positive,0.69,0.3,0.0,mixed,0.08,0.24,0.67,True,English,"['new golden deal', 'blue nerves', 'Pierre', 'Greece', 'moment', 'prayers', 'farmers', 'Giuseppe', 'EpsilonNet', 'Evros MP Tasos Dimoschakis', 'brain gain” banner', 'two Novartis “witnesses', 'Hatzidakis–Tsiaras duo', 'Parliamentary Group meeting', 'Transport Konstantinos Kyranakis', 'Pre-holiday blue complaints', 'Tsiaras’ briefing', 'blue” officials', 'blue circus', 'important news', 'Kyriakos Pierrakakis', 'Twenty votes', 'good luck', 'Greek minister', 'small thing', 'previous decade', 'M.M.', 'coordinating committee', 'coordinating meeting', 'national highways', 'tourist destinations', 'ND offices', 'temperature reading', 'similar circumstances', 'rural regions', 'agricultural prefectures', 'Maximos Mansion', 'good faith', 'camera statements', 'logical irritation', 'real justification', 'Good grief', 'Maria Antoniou', 'revolutionary method', 'Deputy Minister', 'Attica region', 'electoral district', 'senior staff', 'green news', 'ND MP', 'poor president', 'one talking', 'President Nikos', 'Belgian Minister', 'possible day', 'social pressure', 'fellow MPs', 'actual work', 'Code name', 'European People', 'persistent favor', 'many complaints', 'Ms. Arampatzi', 'one point', '30 MPs', 'Newsroom', 'Brussels', 'place', 'presidency', 'Eurogroup', 'play', 'colleagues', 'Ministers', 'Economy', 'Finance', 'stablemate', 'Party', 'predictions', 'assessments', 'afternoon', 'curse', 'country', 'ultimatum', 'blockades', 'coincidence', 'Marinakis', 'Action24', 'dialogue', 'farmers', 'demands', 'Mitsotakis', 'Monday', 'course', 'Sunday', 'things', 'issue', 'transportation', 'Christmas', 'situation', 'example', 'Mill', 'Elves', 'Trikala', 'citizens', 'government', 'initiative', 'deadlock', 'call', 'everyone', 'interests', 'gathering', 'person', 'Zoom', 'Friday', 'session', 'mid-October', 'Voridis', 'jab', 'member', 'strategy', 'voters', 'famous', 'Edessaikos', 'Crisis', 'prayers', 'attention', 'OPEKEPE', 'Kastoria', 'brunt', 'problems', 'Unity', 'tempers', 'OSE', 'unbelievable', 'radar', 'eye', 'sensitivities', 'taxis', 'fact', 'director', 'commotion', 'matter', 'persistence', 'Adonis', 'post', 'court', 'conviction', 'Destempassidis', 'Maraggelis', 'perjury', 'Samaras', 'Venizelos', 'event', 'moment', 'Mimi', 'Papaggelos', 'soul', 'Odysseas', 'Something']",2025-12-11,2025-12-12,en.protothema.gr
