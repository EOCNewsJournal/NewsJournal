But she stressed that EU countries should not outvote Belgium  where the lion's share of the Russian funds are held in the financial depository Euroclear.Belgium has so far resisted the plan  fearing it exposes the country to major legal and financial risks.""I think it's important that they are on board whatever we do "" she said.Agreeing on the reparations loan would send ""a clear signal that if you do all this damage to another country  you have to pay for the reparation "" Kallas said.EU to sanction 40 more 'shadowfleet' vesselsEU ministers are to be joined by their Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha by video-link for an exchange on Kiev's most urgent needs and further EU support for Ukraine.EU chief diplomats are ready to impose sanctions on around 40 additional vessels that are used to circumvent the penalties imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine  Kallas announced.Sanctioning more ships of the so-called shadow fleet means ""depriving Russia of the means to fund this war "" she said.The newly sanctioned vessels would be barred from entering European ports and from obtaining insurance. Sanctions such as asset freezes are also planned against those who support the operation of the shadow fleet.In addition  the bloc intends to open talks with states under whose flags the vessels are registered  seeking their agreement to allow EU naval forces to inspect the tankers.The shadow fleet is Russia's response to the international oil price cap imposed on Russian fossil fuel exports.Moscow has been trying to conceal the origin of its oil using various methods like switching off or manipulating satellite transponders or transferring oil between tankers on the high seas.Middle East and relations with China also on agendaMinisters are also to consult on the situation in the Middle East  as well as the bloc's relationship with China.On the agenda is a discussion on the situation in Gaza and the implementation of the ceasefire there as well as the situation in Syria one year after the fall of the al-Assad regime.The EU has been calling on Israel to let more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and has been waiting to redeploy its border assistance mission to help monitor the crossing in Rafah in the south of Gaza  on the border with Egypt.EU relations with China are also on the agenda.",neutral,0.01,0.74,0.25,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['EU top diplomat', 'reparations loan', 'Talks', 'European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Russian fossil fuel exports', 'available Russian state assets', 'international oil price cap', 'foreign affairs chief', 'EU chief diplomats', 'other financing options', 'EU foreign ministers', 'border assistance mission', 'EU naval forces', 'long-term financial needs', 'European ports', 'Russian funds', 'urgent needs', 'financial support', 'financial depository', 'financial risks', 'coming years', 'credible option', 'large majority', 'first hurdle', 'joint debt', 'new grants', 'unanimous approval', 'majority vote', 'major legal', 'clear signal', 'Ukrainian counterpart', 'Andrii Sybiha', 'shadow fleet', 'asset freezes', 'various methods', 'satellite transponders', 'high seas', 'Middle East', 'al-Assad regime', 'humanitarian aid', 'EU summit', 'EU countries', 'EU members', 'EU ministers', 'EU support', 'reparations loan', ""ministers' meeting"", ""shadowfleet' vessels"", '40 additional vessels', 'EU relations', 'Gaza Strip', 'Monday', 'talks', 'solution', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'work', 'leaders', 'country', 'Friday', 'bloc', 'money', 'Agreeing', 'past', 'Belgium', 'lion', 'share', 'Euroclear', 'plan', 'board', 'damage', 'video', 'link', 'exchange', 'Kiev', 'sanctions', 'penalties', 'war', 'ships', 'means', 'insurance', 'operation', 'states', 'flags', 'agreement', 'tankers', 'response', 'Moscow', 'origin', 'China', 'agenda', 'situation', 'relationship', 'discussion', 'implementation', 'ceasefire', 'Syria', 'fall', 'Israel', 'crossing', 'Rafah', 'south', 'Egypt']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,dpa-international.com
54246,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/629482-russia-frozen-assets-lawsuit-euroclear/,Moscow court to hear $230 billion lawsuit against Belgium’s Euroclear,A Moscow court has registered the Central Bank of Russia’s lawsuit against Belgium’s Euroclear over immobilized funds  records show Read Full Article at RT.com,Russia’s central bank is seeking damages over immobilized sovereign assets held at the clearinghouseA Moscow court has agreed to hear the $230 billion lawsuit filed by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) against Belgium’s Euroclear over immobilized sovereign assets.Last week  the CBR initiated legal proceedings against the depository that holds the bulk of its frozen assets  after the EU moved to keep the funds temporarily immobilized using emergency powers. Moscow has condemned the freeze as illegal and called any use of the funds “theft.”Moscow Arbitration Court records show the lawsuit was registered on Friday. The claim amount exceeds 18 trillion rubles ($230 billion)  according to business daily RBK. The regulator reportedly plans to seek a closed hearing.Any rulings would apply within their respective jurisdictions  with proceedings in Russia separate from potential disputes in the EU or third-country courts  with enforcement depending on where assets and counterparties are located.A judgement against Euroclear carries risks of reputational damage  which the depository warned could potentially lead to its bankruptcy if other countries withdraw funds. Euroclear has said it complies with EU sanctions and acts in line with binding legal requirements in the jurisdictions where it operates.Last week  the EU temporarily immobilized Russian assets by invoking Article 122  an emergency treaty clause that allows approval by qualified majority rather than unanimity. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has proposed using the funds to back a loan to Ukraine.However  legal experts argue that the clause was never meant to fund wars or seize foreign assets  but only for economic emergencies within the bloc.”Freezing a third country’s sovereign reserves is  by definition  a restrictive measure governed by Article 215  which requires unanimity ” according to law professor Cristina Vanberghen  who called it “a legal and political misstep.”Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused EU officials of “raping European law in broad daylight ” calling the move to bypass his country's potential veto  a “declaration of war.”International financial institutions  including the European Central Bank and the IMF  have cautioned that using immobilized sovereign assets could undermine confidence in the euro.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.37,0.62,True,English,"['Moscow court', '$230 billion lawsuit', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'law professor Cristina Vanberghen', 'Moscow Arbitration Court records', 'A Moscow court', 'business daily RBK.', 'International financial institutions', 'European Commission head', 'binding legal requirements', 'emergency treaty clause', 'European Central Bank', 'immobilized sovereign assets', 'European law', 'emergency powers', 'sovereign reserves', 'frozen assets', 'claim amount', '18 trillion rubles', 'closed hearing', 'potential disputes', 'third-country courts', 'reputational damage', 'other countries', 'Russian assets', 'qualified majority', 'legal experts', 'foreign assets', 'economic emergencies', 'restrictive measure', 'political misstep', 'broad daylight', 'potential veto', '$230 billion lawsuit', 'legal proceedings', 'respective jurisdictions', 'third country', 'EU sanctions', 'EU officials', 'damages', 'clearinghouse', 'CBR', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'depository', 'bulk', 'funds', 'freeze', 'Friday', 'regulator', 'rulings', 'enforcement', 'counterparties', 'judgement', 'risks', 'bankruptcy', 'acts', 'line', 'Article 122', 'approval', 'unanimity', 'loan', 'Ukraine', 'wars', 'bloc', 'definition', 'move', 'declaration', 'IMF', 'confidence']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,rt.com

And could Europe do anything differently?,"What it would take to stop Putin fighting in Ukraine2 days ago Share Save James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Share SaveBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat  a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes  he saw three things  ""a K and a G and a B""  a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence. For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour  with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield. Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever. As things stand  there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people  one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes  President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week  he said ""sometimes you have to let people fight it out"".AFP via Getty Images The Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities. Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an ""existential threat"" to the US  and urged the US to ""re-establish strategic stability"" with Russia. So  with American support for Ukraine in serious question  what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine  Europe and even China  do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment  the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the ""coalition of the willing""  it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion  alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country. But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only ""win the fight tonight""  with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders  freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict. Keir Giles  senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank  said these fears were based on ""nonsense"" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft. European leaders  in his view  had to ""insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference"".WPA Pool/Getty Images Zelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance  according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky  Emmanuel Macron  Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: ""The only thing that will unarguably  undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack  and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend."" This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia. Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently  I heard no mention of any Spring offensive  only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure. Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president  pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains  designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace. According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs  in this year  Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200 000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images 'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long  not least fighting with one hand behind their back ' says Fiona HillFiona Hill  senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution  who served on Trump's national security council during his first term  says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. ""Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe "" she says. ""Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.""Trade  sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly  Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%  interest rates 16%  growth slowed  budget deficits soaring  real incomes plunging  consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. ""The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022 "" the authors say. But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking  not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions  such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters In this year alone  Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200 000 dead and wounded  according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge  director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi  said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would  he said  work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants  Lukoil and Rosneft  just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies. Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy  it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. ""We need to stop being cute and go full embargo "" he said. ""We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention."" In theory  sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October  a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt ""very tired"" of the conflict  up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy.Reuters The Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called ""reparation loan"" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years. In Kyiv  officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium  where the bulk of the Russian assets are held  has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday  the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court. Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns  such is its own vast debts  and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone. EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success. There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine  it could mobilise more of its armed forces. It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia)  and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war  many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty Images Ukraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed ""the fathers of the future"". This puzzles outsiders. ""I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people "" one senior UK military figure told me. ""I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight."" Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires  which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. ""Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].""Strikes  diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles  it could hit Russia harder and deeper. This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn. Alexander Gabuev  director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center  says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. ""By late October  Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once. ""Production outages spread across multiple regions  and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel."" But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact  when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent?AFP via Getty Images As well as defending its territory  Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan  former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies  says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. ""They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour  but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war."" Dr Sidharth Kaushal  senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank  said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure  as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. ""It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat "" he said.There's also - still - a diplomatic route. Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war  he may choose it. The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say  a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia  setting up negotiating teams  using its power to drive through agreement. ""The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia "" Thomas Graham argues. ""One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.""China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use  the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes. So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue  then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now  the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.Shutterstock President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted  for transatlantic allies to be divided  and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated  if global markets were disrupted  if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy  then the thinking in Beijing might change. For now though  Putin believes he is sitting pretty  with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on  analysts say  the more Ukrainian morale will fall  the more divided its allies will become  and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. ""Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories "" Putin said last week. ""Nothing will change his position "" Fiona Hill told me. ""Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.""Top picture credit: Reuters",negative,0.0,0.38,0.61,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['difficult question', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'late US Senator John McCain', 'James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Share', 'Chatham House think tank', 'new national security strategy', 'WPA Pool/Getty Images Zelensky', 'vital US intelligence Ukraine', 'US President Donald Trump', 'sufficient security guarantees', 'Soviet intelligence officer', 'The Trump administration', 'senior consulting fellow', 'huge political difficulty', 'Russian energy facilities', 'international military force', 'future Russian invasion', 'longer term support', 'NATO military alliance', 'future Russian aggression', 'actual territorial gains', 'European air defences', 'incoming Russian drones', 'strong western forces', '15 to 20 year war', 'President Trump', 'diplomatic tide', 'Donald Tusk', 'deliberate strategy', 'Russian president', 'international scene', 'Nato membership', 'American support', 'Russian aircraft', 'Russian gains', 'European troops', 'European leaders', 'Western troops', 'western diplomats', 'ruthless autocrat', 'master manipulator', 'poker face', 'past life', 'American envoys', 'supreme confidence', 'improved relationship', 'possible scenarios', 'strategic stability', 'slow advances', 'existential threat', 'serious question', 'financial effort', 'war-ravaged country', 'Ukrainian skies', 'Ukrainian soldiers', 'front line', 'Most proposals', 'Keir Giles', 'Eurasia programme', 'Sky Shield', 'little chance', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Friedrich Merz', 'Mr Giles', 'several weeks', 'Spring offensive', 'back foot', 'Thomas Graham', 'Foreign Affairs', 'President Putin', 'one thing', 'three things', 'Few analysts', 'western Ukraine', 'western Europe', 'Vladimir Putin', 'BBC', 'reputation', 'eyes', 'reference', 'footage', 'Kremlin', 'emotions', 'favour', 'battlefield', 'incentive', 'demands', 'Donetsk', 'territory', 'army', 'point', 'impotence', 'ceasefire', 'terms', 'people', 'hands', 'AFP', 'possibility', 'east', 'mind', 'China', 'moment', 'continent', 'banner', 'coalition', 'willing', 'officials', 'fight', 'cash', 'missiles', 'plan', 'Others', 'borders', 'fear', 'conflict', 'nonsense', 'ground', 'clash', 'view', 'manner', 'difference', 'aspirations', 'reports', 'Sunday', 'Starmer', 'presence', 'resolve', 'course', 'voters', 'confrontation', 'mention', 'need', 'price', 'blood', 'treasure', 'generals', 'situation', 'peace']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,bbc.com

The investigation has led to the resignations of Zelensky’s chief of staff  Andrey Yermak  and other top officials.In a social media post accompanying an interview on Saturday with Slovensko Radio  Fico said there had been “shouts” when he previously warned to “watch out for corruption” in Kiev  arguing the EU did not know where the €177 billion ($208 billion) it has given Ukraine had ended up.He said he wanted no part of a new plan to provide a further aid for Ukraine  “above all” for arms  and stressed he would never back any financial package aimed at buying weapons that would “kill more people.”“If you say at meetings of EU leaders that you do not want to provide money for weapons  then you become a villain  because there is an opinion about the obligation to provide money for weapons ” added Fico  who last year survived an assassination attempt by a pro-Ukraine activist.Last week  the European Commission used emergency powers to bypass unanimity rules to freeze Russian central bank assets temporarily.

The European Commission  and its head Ursula von der Leyen  want to use the $246 billion to back a “reparations loan” to Kiev – a scheme opposed by several countries  including Hungary and Slovakia. Russia has condemned the freeze as illegal and called any use of the funds “theft ” warning of economic and legal consequences.In a social media post  Orban stated on Saturday that EU officials were trying to seize frozen Russian assets by “bypassing Hungary” and “raping European law in broad daylight ” which he said would amount to a “declaration of war.” He accused Brussels of fueling the conflict  adding that Hungary “will not play along” in what he called a “twisted” scheme.“I have never seen a seizure of 200 to 300 billion euros from a country that did not trigger some form of response ” Orban said.According to the Hungarian leader  “three Germans are calling the shots.” He accused German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  European People’s Party leader Manfred Weber and von der Leyen of steering the EU “into a dead end” or “straight into a wall.”The vote put forward by von der Leyen cast the handling of frozen Russian assets as an economic emergency rather than a sanctions policy  enabling the EC to use Article 122 of the EU treaties to adopt the decision via a qualified majority vote instead of unanimity and sidestep veto threats.Belgium  where most of the funds are held  has also raised concerns due to the legal and financial risks.

This shift…,"EU’s emergency freeze on Russian Central Bank assets sparks debate over credibility and legal authorityThe European Union has used emergency powers to indefinitely freeze about €210 billion in Russian Central Bank assets  bypassing the usual requirement for unanimous approval from member states and removing the veto threat from Hungary and Slovakia.This shift marks a major change in EU sanctions strategy  moving away from six-monthly renewals that required unanimity and instead keeping the assets immobilised until Russia ends its war in Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused.Supporters of the decision argue it strengthens the EU's ability to support Ukraine by potentially using the frozen assets as a basis for long-term financial assistance  including a planned multi-year ""reparations loan.""Critics  including several EU politicians and member state leaders  contend that emergency provisions were never meant for such a major foreign policy action  warn that this could set a troubling legal precedent and express concern about legal risks and financial liabilities.Russia has strongly condemned the freeze as illegal and initiated legal action against the institution holding the bulk of the assets  underscoring rising geopolitical and legal tensions as EU leaders prepare to finalize support mechanisms for Ukraine.The European Union's decision to invoke emergency powers to indefinitely freeze the assets of the Russian Central Bank has sparked intense controversy  raising questions about legal authority  institutional credibility and the future cohesion of the bloc.On Friday  Dec. 12  EU member states moved to lock down roughly €210 billion ($245.5 billion) in Russian sovereign assets held within the union using Article 122 of the EU treaty  a provision designed for economic emergencies that allows bypassing the usual requirement for unanimous agreement. This maneuver effectively sidestepped veto threats from Hungary and Slovakia  which had opposed extending sanctions under the existing six-month renewal framework.The freeze marks a significant shift in Brussels' approach to sanctions and financial policy toward Moscow. Previously  the immobilization of Russian assets — most of which are held at the Brussels-based securities depository Euroclear — depended on unanimity among all 27 EU states and was subject to veto by politically sympathetic governments. By using emergency powers  the EU has removed that veto risk and aimed to provide a firmer legal basis for keeping the funds frozen until Russia ends its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and pays reparations for the immense damage it has caused.Supporters of the decision argue it strengthens the EU's hand in supporting Ukraine and prevents individual member states from undermining collective action. The move is intended to facilitate a multi-year financial package for Ukraine — often described as a ""reparations loan"" — enabling Kyiv to sustain its military and civilian needs for 2026 and 2027. The loan would be backed by the frozen assets and repaid only if and when Russia complies with conditions related to ending the war and compensating Ukraine.However  the decision has drawn fierce criticism from political figures across Europe  including Fernand Kartheiser  a member of the European Parliament from Luxembourg. Kartheiser warned that invoking Article 122 in this context could damage the EU's credibility  weaken the role of national governments and undermine confidence in the bloc's institutions. He cautioned that the move risks deterring investors and could fuel Euroscepticism among voters  particularly in smaller and medium-sized member states that feel sidelined by the actions of Brussels.Legal battles and geopolitical tensions intensify ahead of EU summitCritics argue that emergency provisions were never intended to address foreign policy issues of such magnitude  and that stretching the legal basis for this freeze could set an unsettling precedent. Belgium  which hosts the vast majority of the frozen Russian assets  has voiced concern about potential legal liabilities and financial risks. Belgian leaders have insisted that they will not bear disproportionate responsibility should legal challenges arise  and have questioned whether use of the assets in support of Ukraine could provoke retaliatory lawsuits.Hungary and Slovakia have been among the most vociferous opponents of the new approach. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán denounced the decision as an unlawful overreach that undermines the rule of law within the European Union and accused Brussels of placing itself above established treaties. Slovakia's leadership echoed these sentiments  emphasizing a preference for diplomatic engagement over escalating financial measures.Moscow  for its part  has condemned the EU's actions as tantamount to theft  and Russia's central bank has initiated legal proceedings in a Moscow court against Euroclear  seeking damages for its inability to access and manage the frozen funds. Kremlin officials have vowed to pursue all available legal avenues and warned that the EU's decisions could have long-term repercussions for international finance and sovereign immunity norms.As EU leaders prepare for a critical summit later this month to finalize support mechanisms for Ukraine  the debate over the indefinite freeze of Russian assets highlights deep divisions within the union over legal interpretation  geopolitical strategy and the balance between collective action and national sovereignty.According to BrightU.AI's Enoch  the EU's indefinite freeze on Russian assets exposes the hypocrisy of Western institutions  weaponizing finance under the guise of ""justice"" while undermining sovereignty and setting a dangerous precedent for global economic warfare. This move  driven by U.S. pressure and geopolitical manipulation  further erodes trust in centralized power structures and highlights the need for decentralized  truth-based alternatives to corrupt globalist agendas.Watch the video below about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban talking against Ukraine's thirst to join the EU while campaigning against Hungary.This video is from the Cynthia's Pursuit of Truth channel on Brighteon.com.Sources include:RT.comEuroNews.comBrightU.aiBrighteon.com",neutral,0.01,0.74,0.25,negative,0.0,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Russian Central Bank assets', 'emergency freeze', 'legal authority', 'EU', 'debate', 'credibility', 'NaturalNews', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán', 'existing six-month renewal framework', 'Brussels-based securities depository Euroclear', 'major foreign policy action', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'foreign policy issues', 'long-term financial assistance', 'multi-year financial package', 'escalating financial measures', 'available legal avenues', 'individual member states', 'medium-sized member states', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'member state leaders', 'troubling legal precedent', 'potential legal liabilities', 'several EU politicians', 'The European Union', 'firmer legal basis', 'multi-year ""reparations loan', 'EU member states', 'EU sanctions strategy', 'financial policy', 'major change', 'financial liabilities', 'Russian assets', 'legal action', 'collective action', 'European Parliament', 'unsettling precedent', 'financial risks', '27 EU states', 'Belgian leaders', 'legal authority', 'legal risks', 'legal tensions', 'Legal battles', 'legal challenges', 'legal proceedings', 'EU leaders', 'emergency powers', 'usual requirement', 'unanimous approval', 'veto threat', 'six-monthly renewals', 'emergency provisions', 'rising geopolitical', 'intense controversy', 'future cohesion', 'economic emergencies', 'unanimous agreement', 'sympathetic governments', 'veto risk', 'full-scale invasion', 'civilian needs', 'fierce criticism', 'political figures', 'national governments', 'geopolitical tensions', 'vast majority', 'disproportionate responsibility', 'retaliatory lawsuits', 'vociferous opponents', 'new approach', 'unlawful overreach', 'diplomatic engagement', 'Kremlin officials', 'EU treaty', 'EU summit', 'frozen assets', 'support mechanisms', 'significant shift', 'immense damage', 'Fernand Kartheiser', 'institutional credibility', ""Brussels' approach"", 'Moscow court', 'emergency freeze', 'frozen funds', 'debate', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'unanimity', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Supporters', 'decision', 'ability', 'Critics', 'concern', 'bulk', 'questions', 'bloc', 'Friday', 'Dec.', 'Article', 'maneuver', 'immobilization', 'politically', 'hand', 'move', 'Kyiv', 'military', 'conditions', 'Luxembourg', 'context', 'role', 'confidence', 'institutions', 'investors', 'Euroscepticism', 'voters', 'smaller', 'actions', 'magnitude', 'Belgium', 'use', 'rule', 'treaties', 'leadership', 'sentiments', 'preference', 'part', 'theft', 'damages', '2026']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,naturalnews.com

The court said it received the central bank’s claim on December 12  demanding 18.2 trillion roubles - the full value of Russia’s frozen sovereign assets.If the central bank wins  it could seek enforcement against Euroclear's assets in other jurisdictions  especially those deemed ""friendly"" by Russia.Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia has repeatedly warned the EU that using its sovereign reserves amounts to theft  undermines confidence in central banks and the euro  and has vowed harsh retaliation  including seizing European private investors’ holdings in Russia.""What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear  in euro or in the EU  if they understand that their property rights are not respected and their assets can be taken away under any pretext "" Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters.Russia's central bank said on December 12 that EU plans to use its assets were illegal and it reserved the right to employ all available means to protect its interests.Implementation would be challenged in ""national courts  judicial authorities of foreign states and international organizations  arbitral tribunals and other international judicial instances "" it said.""The Bank of Russia may attempt to enforce a Russian court's decision against Euroclear in China  Hong Kong  the UAE  Kazakhstan and other friendly jurisdictions  if such assets can be identified "" said Gleb Boyko from NSP law firm.Plans to use Russian money have faced opposition in Europe  with bankers warning that seizing such a large pile of sovereign assets would be legally questionable and set a precedent.A 2024 paper published by Sweden's Riksbank said that such a move would mark the first time that non-belligerent countries seize the assets of a belligerent country in an ongoing war to help a third country.The EU proposals run counter to an idea published in some versions of a U.S.-based peace plan that the Russian reserves could be split  with some used to reconstruct Ukraine and some to create a U.S.-Russia investment vehicle.Dmitriev called the EU plans ""a blow to the international reserves system created by the United States"".",negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Russia', 'damages', 'Euroclear', 'assets', 'U.S.-based peace plan', 'U.S.-Russia investment vehicle', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'other international judicial instances', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Trusted News Source', '210 billion euros worth', 'private investors’ holdings', 'NSP law firm', 'international reserves system', 'other friendly jurisdictions', 'sovereign reserves amounts', 'The European Union', 'frozen Russian assets', 'other jurisdictions', 'investment envoy', 'Russian reserves', 'judicial authorities', 'international organizations', 'The Bank', 'Russian money', 'Russian court', 'central banks', 'Live Events', 'first step', 'legal nightmare', 'civilian needs', 'Legal experts', 'swift ruling', 'Belgium-based depository', '18.2 trillion roubles', 'full value', 'harsh retaliation', 'rational investor', 'property rights', 'available means', 'national courts', 'foreign states', 'arbitral tribunals', 'Hong Kong', 'Gleb Boyko', 'large pile', 'first time', 'belligerent countries', 'belligerent country', 'ongoing war', 'third country', 'United States', 'sovereign assets', 'Commercial Court', 'EU leaders', 'EU proposals', 'Kirill Dmitriev', 'EU plans', 'Reliable', 'Addas', 'MOSCOW', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'Euroclear', 'Kremlin', 'Ukraine', 'part', 'loan', 'Kyiv', 'military', 'Friday', 'NATO', 'claim', 'December', 'enforcement', 'request', 'comment', 'theft', 'confidence', 'securities', 'pretext', 'Reuters', 'interests', 'Implementation', 'decision', 'China', 'UAE', 'Kazakhstan', 'opposition', 'bankers', 'precedent', '2024 paper', 'Sweden', 'Riksbank', 'move', 'idea', 'versions', 'blow']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Big decisions are usually preceded by weeks  or months  of lower level discussions between diplomats  and a fair amount of political positioning and hand-wringing by governments.But you can feel the pace of things change in Brussels as a hard deadline approaches. This is one such week.“It is crunch time for Europe and Ukraine ” Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Monday morning.The EU’s top representative on foreign affairs  Kaja Kallas  similarly described it as a “make-or-break” moment for Ukraine  as parallel negotiations take place on a US-brokered peace proposal and a plan in Brussels to finance a large loan to help keep Kyiv in the fight should ceasefire talks stall again.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signalled that Ukraine might let go of its ambition to join the Nato military alliance  provided the US and other western allies agree to guarantee Ukraine’s security  to deter any Russian threat.So far  it seems all the concessions in the negotiations have come from the Ukrainian side. Russian president Vladimir Putin has shown little sign of compromise.European leaders fear Washington will put pressure on Ukraine to sign a peace deal that overly favours Moscow.Their real worry is that a shaky truce will afford Russia a chance to regroup and find some pretext to launch another attack on Kyiv in a few years’ time.Hence the insistence from Zelenskiy that Ukraine will need solid guarantees the US will lend the threat of its military might to ward off such a scenario.One thing Europe can do is help to plug a financial hole faced by Ukraine and shore up Kyiv’s ability to hold off further Russian advances on the battlefield.The leaders of the EU’s 27 states fly in to Brussels for a summit which begins on Thursday. They are not expected to leave until a decision has been taken on how to fund a large package of financial support for Ukraine.There is a proposal to use Russian state assets  frozen in Europe by economic sanctions since the start of the war  to fund a €90 billion loan to Kyiv.The Belgian government opposes the so-called reparations loan for fear it will be hurt by the legal and political fallout. The assets are frozen in Euroclear  a securities depository housing other countries’ government bonds in Belgium. Intensive efforts are under way to change the Belgian government’s view.Failing to land an agreement this week would be very damaging for Europe  particularly now that Ukraine needs all the help it can get from its friends.,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['European Union', 'Ukraine support', 'break', 'moment', 'other countries’ government bonds', 'Russian president Vladimir Putin', 'other western allies', 'lower level discussions', 'Lars Lokke Rasmussen', 'European Union machine', 'Nato military alliance', 'Russian state assets', 'US-brokered peace proposal', 'Ukrainian president', 'Russian advances', 'Belgian government', 'peace deal', 'military might', 'Russian threat', 'Big decisions', 'fair amount', 'political positioning', 'hard deadline', 'crunch time', 'foreign minister', 'Monday morning', 'top representative', 'foreign affairs', 'Kaja Kallas', 'large loan', 'ceasefire talks', 'Ukrainian side', 'little sign', 'European leaders', 'real worry', 'shaky truce', 'years’ time', 'solid guarantees', 'One thing', 'financial hole', 'large package', 'financial support', 'economic sanctions', '€90 billion loan', 'reparations loan', 'political fallout', 'securities depository', 'Intensive efforts', 'parallel negotiations', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'wheels', 'weeks', 'months', 'diplomats', 'governments', 'pace', 'things', 'Brussels', 'Ukraine', 'Denmark', 'break', 'moment', 'place', 'plan', 'Kyiv', 'fight', 'ambition', 'security', 'concessions', 'compromise', 'Washington', 'pressure', 'Moscow', 'chance', 'pretext', 'attack', 'insistence', 'scenario', 'ability', 'battlefield', '27 states', 'summit', 'Thursday', 'start', 'war', 'fear', 'legal', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'way', 'view', 'agreement', 'help', 'friends']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,irishtimes.com

He may need to rethink that.,Not surprisingly  Russia has immediately filed a lawsuit in Moscow seeking damages from Euroclear and has threatened to sue for damages in other jurisdictions and use all available legal and other mechanisms to protect its interests. It has also looked at seizing assets held by Euroclear and other Western interests – funds and businesses – within Russia. The EU was aware of the likely Russian response when it decided to freeze the funds indefinitely. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. After dithering for two years over what to do with the Russian assets  the EU has invoked emergency powers to pass legislation that freezes them indefinitely. Credit: AP Trump’s willingness to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for cash has echoes within the Nvidia deal. In 2022  the Biden administration  as part of its “small yard  high fence” strategy of limiting China’s access to strategic technology  banned sales of America’s most advanced semiconductors – critical to artificial intelligence technologies – to China. The decision was made on national security grounds.Trump partly lifted the ban earlier this year  allowing Nvidia to sell a specially created custom chip to China  the H20  which was much less sophisticated than Nvidia’s most powerful chips. China  however  didn’t buy the H20 chips and the Trump administration hasn’t collected any revenue from the 15 per cent share of sales of the chips to China that it negotiated with Nvidia. Then  last week  Trump shocked the US security establishment by announcing that he would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China in return for 25 per cent of the revenue. He was willing to trade Ukrainian land  including territory its forces hold  for a profit-sharing deal with Russia. He was prepared to set aside national security concerns for a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia. Nvidia had argued that  with China throwing its entire system behind development of chips that are competitive with Nvidia’s  including subsidies  cheap electricity and mandated procurement by government agencies  the best strategy for the US was to make China and other countries dependent on US technology and its Nvidia-centric hardware and software ecosystem.In effect  Trump traded the prohibition of sales of a technology where the US has a material competitive advantage over China to its main technological  economic and geopolitical rival for dollars. It’s not clear that he has the power to do that. Loading The administration doesn’t have the authority to levy export taxes  which is why it appears it is trying to construct a work-around  with the chips being made in Taiwan  shipped to the US  subjected to a 25 per cent tariff as if they were imports and then  ostensibly after a security review  shipped to China. China  however  while it has advocated for access to the latest US chips  isn’t exactly swooning at the opportunity Trump has presented.As happened earlier this year in relation to the H20 chips  it would seem China may ban  or at least limit access for its companies  to the H200. That may be because of its own national security concerns – it has expressed fears that US chips might come with embedded kill switches or (and Nvidia has been developing this) a location tracker – but it is more likely driven by the flip side of the US argument that making China more reliant on US technology would hinder the development of its homegrown chips. Nvidia isn’t including any revenue from sales of the chip to China in its own forecasts. Credit: AP China is pursuing self-sufficiency across its economy  including the tech sector. It wants its national champions like Huawei to continue to invest in the research and development that might close the gap with the US. It doesn’t want those R&D funds siphoned off by Nvidia and Trump. China has used a less efficient approach to AI than the US  linking hundreds of processors to offset the lower performance of its chips and subsidising the energy required because the chips are less energy-efficient  to close some of that gap and  according to Bloomberg  is considering a new $US70 billion ($105.4 billion) package to support its domestic chipmakers.It is almost inconceivable that China would allow its tech sector to become reliant on US chips or take their foot off the pedal in developing domestic alternatives  although it is possible it might selectively allow some purchases of the H200 to help fast-track the training of its AI models. The H200 is about six times more powerful than the H20s Nvidia was previously allowed to sell to China  but the Blackwell chips are far more powerful again. Nvidia’s next-generation chip  the Rubin  will again raise the bar in terms of speed  memory and efficiency when it is released next year. Thus  while the H200 would narrow the gap  thought to be about two years  between China’s tech and the bleeding-edge US chips  it is chasing a moving target. It is unlikely that China will deviate from a strategy dedicated to self-sustenance and therefore the $US10 billion to $US15 billion of extra Nvidia sales that analysts think Nvidia might generate if China embraced the opportunity to buy H200s (and $US2.5 billion to $US3.75 billion of revenue for the US government) is unlikely to be realised. Nvidia isn’t including any revenue from sales of the chip to China in its own forecasts. Trump is transactional and loves his reputation as a dealmaker. He was willing to trade Ukrainian land  including territory its forces hold  for a profit-sharing deal with Russia.

Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAReforming the “triple lock” system to remove the veto the United Nations Security Council in effect has over the deployment of Irish peacekeepers on new missions is about taking back “our sovereignty”  Helen McEntee has said.Under the present system  no more than 12 Irish soldiers can be sent into battle zones without the permission of the Government  the Dáil and the UN.The Government is bringing forward legislation that would end the requirement for a UN mandate.Speaking on Monday  the Minister for Foreign Affairs said she wanted to move quickly on getting the draft legislation passed by the Oireachtas.The Government has complained that the present system allowed permanent members of the UN security council – which includes Russia  China and the United States – to veto any proposal to establish new peacekeeping missions by the international organisation.Ms McEntee said reforming the so-called “triple lock” on overseas deployments of the Defence Forces would not weaken Ireland’s policy of military neutrality.“It is quite simply the case at the moment that any one of five permanent members can veto and prevent any new peacekeeping missions from taking place  and because of that veto there has not been a new peacekeeping mission since 2014 ” she said.“I think we need to take back our sovereignty in that regard. We need to take back our ability to be able to deploy our troops on the ground in parts of the world that need their expertise.”The long-standing UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon  Unifil  is set to be wound down after next year following opposition from the US and Israel to the mission being extended.Ms McEntee said the Government had to be in a position where it could decide where to deploy peacekeepers itself.“We have a long-standing history  and a history we’re very proud of  providing peacekeeping troops on the ground. We should be able to continue that ourselves without others being able to veto it ” she said.A spokesman for the Department of Defence said the legislation to reform the triple lock was still being drafted.The proposed legislation “will be published and debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas in early 2026”  he said.The changes would allow Irish troops to be deployed overseas  for example either as peacekeepers or to arrange the evacuation of Irish citizens from conflicts  on the agreement of the Government and Dáil.Ms McEntee was speaking in Brussels before attending a meeting of the European Union’s 27 foreign ministers.She reiterated Ireland’s support for a plan to use Russian state cash  frozen in Europe by economic sanctions after Moscow invaded Ukraine  to fund a €90 billion loan to Kyiv.The Belgian government opposes the so-called reparations loan for fear of the legal and political fallout  as the assets are frozen in Euroclear  a securities depository in Belgium.An injection of significant funding from European allies is seen as crucial to shoring up Ukraine’s defences on the battlefield. Kyiv is projected to start to run short of cash by the middle of next year.An alternative to using the “frozen” Russian assets is for EU states to jointly fund a loan for Ukraine by borrowing money on the market themselves.A decision on whether to tap the frozen Russian assets is expected at an EU summit of leaders starting on Thursday.“The reparations loan is the way that we see that as best moving forward ” Ms McEntee said.

Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP via GettyThe ​chance of a peace process around ‍the Ukraine war is now closer than ‍at any time since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022  German chancellor ‌Friedrich Merz said on Monday  adding that the ⁠US had offered “considerable” security guarantees.“What ‌the ​US ‍has placed on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal ⁠and material guarantees is ⁠really considerable ” Mr Merz told ⁠a joint news conference with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‍after hours of talks with US negotiators.“A territorial settlement remains a key question ” he added. “Only the Ukrainian people  the ‌American president  the Ukrainian ‌president  here defending his territory  can give an answer ... ‌Only Ukraine can decide about ⁠territorial concessions. No ifs or buts.”Earlier  the European Union’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said pressuring Ukraine to give up the “fortress” of the Donbas region in any peace agreement would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to be conquered in a future Russian attack.European leaders are desperate to avoid Washington pushing Ukraine into a shaky truce that favours Moscow and potentially undermines Ukraine and Europe’s future security.The question of territorial concessions  a red line for Ukraine and key demand for Russia  is seen as one of the biggest sticking points in agreeing a truce in Europe’s deadliest conflict since 1945.Ukrainian ‍negotiators held a further round of talks with US officials in Berlin on Monday. During weekend discussions  US negotiators reportedly insisted Ukraine should give up territory in the east that Russia had been unable to take by force.A wider group of European leaders travelled to Berlin for talks with Mr Zelenskiy.High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas speaks to the media in Brussels on Monday. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAIn a statement afterwards  European leaders gave an outline of proposed security guarantees they said had been agreed with US officials.They included a commitment Ukraine be permitted to maintain a peacetime army of 800 000 troops  which would be supported by a European-led military force securing Ukraine’s skies.The statement said a US-led “ceasefire monitoring and verification” system would watch for signs of any future attack or breach of a ceasefire.A peace deal should also include a “legally binding commitment” from allies to take steps to “restore peace” in the event Ukraine faced a future attack. “These measures may include armed force  intelligence and logistical assistance  economic and diplomatic actions ” the statement said.The statement  signed by Mr Merz  French president Emmanuel Macron  UK prime minister Keir Starmer and several other EU leaders  pledged strong support for Ukraine’s bid for EU membership.Speaking earlier in Brussels  Ms Kallas said taking the eastern Donbas region would not be Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s “end game”. The real goal was to control the entire country  the former Estonian prime minister said. “If Ukraine goes  then other regions are also in danger ” Ms Kallas said.The US and Ukraine were making “real progress” during talks in Berlin  Ukraine’s negotiator Rustem Umerov said earlier on Monday  in a post on X. “We hope we will reach an agreement that will bring us closer to peace ” he said.Mr Zelenskiy indicated his country might shelve its ambition to join the Nato military alliance  a key demand it had previously put forward as a condition of any peace deal.However  Mr Zelenskiy said Kyiv would still need the US and other western allies to provide solid security guarantees  which would act as a deterrent to any future Russian attack.Separate negotiations are continuing in Brussels to provide a significant package of financial support to Ukraine this week  to fill a shortfall expected to be felt towards the second half of next year.The leaders of the EU’s 27 member states meet in Brussels on Thursday for what will be tense negotiations on a plan to use Russian state assets to fund a €90 billion loan to Kyiv. The Russian cash has been frozen in Europe by economic sanctions introduced in the early days of the war.The Belgian government continues to withhold its support for the plan  which is politically seen as crucial to its success given the assets are frozen in Euroclear  a securities depository in Belgium.The Belgian government is concerned the so-called reparations loan would draw retaliation from Moscow. It wants assurances any risk would be carried by the EU as a whole.Alternative options  such as EU states jointly borrowing money to fund a loan to Ukraine  had not flown in the past  Ms Kallas said. “The most credible option is the reparations loan ” she said.Joint EU borrowing would need the unanimous support of all 27 states  meaning Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orban would likely block the plan.The loan funded by Russia’s frozen central bank assets would only require the agreement of a large majority of capitals.,neutral,0.1,0.84,0.06,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Peace process', 'Russian invasion', 'Ukraine', 'time', 'start', 'Merz', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'former Estonian prime minister', 'German chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'German chancellor \u200cFriedrich Merz', 'Russian leader Vladimir Putin', 'French president Emmanuel Macron', 'several other EU leaders', 'UK prime minister', 'joint news conference', 'biggest sticking points', 'Nato military alliance', 'Joint EU borrowing', 'foreign policy chief', 'European-led military force', 'US-led “ceasefire monitoring', 'eastern Donbas region', 'other western allies', 'Russian state assets', 'considerable” security guarantees', 'future Russian attack', 'solid security guarantees', 'Mr Merz', 'other regions', 'Russian cash', 'Security Policy', 'future attack', 'future security', 'material guarantees', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Ukrainian president', '\u200cAmerican president', 'Ukrainian \u200cpresident', 'European leaders', 'EU membership', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Tobias Schwarz/AFP', 'full-scale invasion', 'territorial settlement', 'Ukrainian people', 'territorial concessions', 'European Union', 'Kaja Kallas', 'red line', 'key demand', 'deadliest conflict', 'Ukrainian \u200dnegotiators', 'weekend discussions', 'wider group', 'Mr Zelenskiy', 'High Representative', 'Olivier Hoslet/EPA', 'peacetime army', 'verification” system', 'armed force', 'logistical assistance', 'diplomatic actions', 'Keir Starmer', 'Ms Kallas', 'end game', 'real goal', 'real progress', 'Rustem Umerov', 'Separate negotiations', 'significant package', 'second half', 'next year', 'tense negotiations', 'early days', 'Belgian government', 'securities depository', 'Alternative options', 'credible option', 'EU states', 'strong support', 'financial support', 'unanimous support', 'peace process', 'peace deal', '27 member states', 'US negotiators', 'US officials', 'The US', '€90 billion loan', 'reparations loan', 'key question', 'shaky truce', 'binding commitment', 'economic sanctions', 'entire country', 'peace agreement', 'Ukraine war', '27 states', '\u200bUS', 'Berlin', 'Monday', 'Photograph', 'Getty', '\u200bchance', 'table', 'terms', 'legal', 'hours', 'talks', 'territory', 'answer', 'ifs', 'fortress', 'rest', 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'round', 'media', 'Brussels', 'statement', 'outline', '800,000 troops', 'skies', 'signs', 'breach', 'steps', 'event', 'measures', 'intelligence', 'bid', 'danger', 'post', 'ambition', 'condition', 'Kyiv', 'deterrent', 'shortfall', 'Thursday', 'plan', 'success', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'retaliation', 'assurances', 'risk', 'money', 'past', 'Hungary']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,irishtimes.com

Meanwhile  selective use cases  such as DBS’s tokenized structured notes on Ethereum  show that public blockchains are also being deployed where investor access  programmability  and market design make openness viable.""Doha Bank’s debut digital bond issuance underscores the tangible  real-world efficiencies that cutting-edge digital infrastructure is delivering for capital markets  and the increasing appetite among our clients for this next-gen capability and execution ” said Salman Ansari  the bank’s global head of capital markets  in a release.Designed for regulated marketsUnlike public blockchains  which are open networks  Euroclear’s DLT is designed for regulated capital markets  offering controlled access  legal finality  and integration with existing custody and settlement systems.That structure allows issuers to capture the efficiency gains of tokenization  such as T+0 settlement and automated record keeping  while remaining compatible with international market standards and institutional investor requirements.""This transaction demonstrates that same-day execution and settlement are achievable through a neutral  regulated DLT infrastructure that aligns with established market standards – reducing friction and time while maintaining the level of assurance expected by issuers and investors "" Sebastien Danloy  chief business officer at Euroclear  said.The transaction sits within a broader regional push to modernize capital markets infrastructure rather than to create parallel crypto-native systems.Orion  developed by HSBC  has been used for sovereign and corporate digital bonds in Hong Kong  mainland China  and the Middle East  and is designed to integrate directly with existing post-trade infrastructure such as Euroclear  Clearstream  and Hong Kong’s Central Moneymarkets Unit.That interoperability allows issuers to achieve faster settlement and on-chain record keeping while keeping custody  listing  and investor access anchored in familiar market structures.Onyx  now branded under JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform  serves a similar role for bank-issued debt and commercial paper  enabling end-to-end issuance and near-instant settlement using tokenized cash.Standard Chartered said the deal reflected rising client demand for digital issuance.Together  the deal adds to a growing body of digital bond issuance across the Middle East and Asia  where banks and regulators are steadily moving tokenization from pilot projects into live markets by embedding DLT into existing capital markets infrastructure rather than reinventing it.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.22,0.26,0.53,True,English,"['$150M Digital Bond', 'Doha Bank', 'DLT Platform', 'Euroclear', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'permissioned distributed ledger technology', 'Digital Financial Market Infrastructure', 'debut digital bond issuance', 'neutral, regulated DLT infrastructure', 'existing capital markets infrastructure', 'cutting-edge digital infrastructure', '$150 million digital bond', 'existing post-trade infrastructure', 'corporate digital bonds', 'The Qatari lender', 'London Stock Exchange', 'central securities depository', 'tangible, real-world efficiencies', 'automated record keeping', 'chief business officer', 'broader regional push', 'Central Moneymarkets Unit', 'chain record keeping', 'rising client demand', 'International Securities Market', 'familiar market structures', 'international market standards', 'institutional investor requirements', 'parallel crypto-native systems', 'institutional tokenized debt', 'permissioned DLT platform', 'tokenized structured notes', 'sole global coordinator', 'selective use cases', 'regulated capital markets', 'ledger infrastructure', 'digital issuance', 'regulated markets', 'market design', 'tokenized cash', 'live markets', 'DLT systems', 'native notes', 'sole arranger', 'global head', 'existing custody', 'Kinexys platform', 'bank-issued debt', 'investor access', 'end issuance', 'settlement systems', 'DLT) platforms', 'public blockchains', 'preferred rails', 'CoinDesk products', 'privacy policy', 'Standard Chartered', 'growing number', 'Middle East', 'regulatory control', 'increasing appetite', 'next-gen capability', 'Salman Ansari', 'open networks', 'controlled access', 'legal finality', 'efficiency gains', 'Sebastien Danloy', 'Hong Kong', 'mainland China', 'similar role', 'commercial paper', 'growing body', 'pilot projects', 'same-day settlement', 'T+0 settlement', 'faster settlement', 'instant settlement', 'Doha Bank', 'same-day execution', 'Euroclear', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'deal', 'structuring', 'distribution', 'banks', 'regulators', 'Asia', 'DBS', 'Ethereum', 'programmability', 'openness', 'clients', 'release', 'integration', 'issuers', 'tokenization', 'transaction', 'friction', 'time', 'level', 'assurance', 'investors', 'Orion', 'HSBC', 'sovereign', 'Clearstream', 'interoperability', 'listing', 'Onyx', 'JPMorgan']",2025-12-15,2025-12-16,coindesk.com

Importantly  efgartigimod showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile  and no new safety signals were identified.“We are disappointed the studies did not meet our desired outcome and we especially empathize with patients who are living with TED and seeking new therapies for this challenging disease ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “We had pre-planned this futility analysis as it provides a meaningful interim evaluation of observed patient outcomes and enables us to responsibly evaluate the study’s future likelihood of success. This approach is fundamental to our disciplined and responsible stewardship of investment and resources in our clinical development programs. We are deeply grateful to the TED community and all those who contributed to these studies.”The IDMC conducted a futility evaluation of unblinded data from patients completing 24 weeks in the Phase 3 studies. Following close out and database lock  argenx will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data to enhance understanding of the studies’ outcomes and uncover key biological insights that may inform future research in TED. Data from the studies will be shared at a future medical meeting.UplighTED Study DesignThe Phase 3 randomized  double-masked  placebo-controlled  multicenter studies are designed to evaluate the efficacy  safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and immunogenicity of efgartigimod PH20 SC administered by prefilled syringe in adult participants with thyroid eye disease. Enrolled participants have active  moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease associated with autoimmune thyroid conditions (Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo PH20 SC  respectively during the double-blinded treatment period. The primary endpoint is measured as the percentage of participants who were proptosis responders at week 24. Key secondary endpoints include change in proptosis measurement in the study eye from baseline up to week 24  change in the total Graves' Orbitopathy Quality of Life (GO-QoL) score from baseline up to week 24  and percentage of participants with resolution of diplopia at week 24.About Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) is an autoimmune orbital disease associated with Graves’ disease and other autoimmune thyroid pathologies such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. TED is characterized by extraocular muscle enlargement  orbital adipose tissue expansion  and orbital inflammation  which can lead to proptosis  diplopia  or vision loss in severe cases. Persistent orbital symptoms often impair patient quality of life. In the active phase  swelling and protrusion can cause pain and may affect vision. In the inactive phase  some symptoms may improve; however  protrusion and double vision may persist.About VYVGART and VYVGART SCVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) globally  and for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Japan. VYVGART SC is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. It is marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo in the U.S.  VYVGART SC in Europe  VYVDURA® in Japan  and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.This press release contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation 596/2014).About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  is pleased to share today …,Louvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  December 15  2025 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  is pleased to share today that  on December 11  The Lancet – one of the world’s most renowned academic journals – published a landmark study that recommends proton therapy as a new standard of care for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. This study  led by MD Anderson Cancer Center  the world’s leading hospital for cancer care  is the first-ever randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide the highest level of evidence demonstrating the benefits of proton therapy over conventional radiotherapy for this indication.Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer that develops in the throat region  a highly sensitive area containing fragile  critical structures  making precisely targeted local treatments particularly relevant. It is a growing global health concern  with more than 100 0001 new cases diagnosed annually. Standard treatment  with the current state-of-the-art photon radiotherapy  intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy  often results in major side effects  including significant weight loss  dependence on feeding tubes  dry mouth  and loss of taste.The trial involved over 20 institutions and enrolled 440 patients  representing the first-ever level 1 randomized phase 3 trial comparing Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) with advanced photon therapy (IMRT).The MD Anderson study delivers Level 1 evidence with the following key findings:Significant improvement in overall survival: Five-year overall survival rate of 90.9% with IMPT versus 81.0% with IMRTFive-year overall survival rate of 90.9% with IMPT versus 81.0% with IMRT 42% reduction in the hazard of death with IMPTwith IMPT Significantly reduced rates of severe toxicities (grade 3 and above) compared to IMRT. Toxicities include lymphopenia  neutropenia  xerostomia  dysphagia  and gastrotomy-tube dependence.Level 1 evidence is the strongest evidence in medical research in this case coming from a large well-conducted multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) -. It provides the most reliable basis for informed clinical decision-makingThese results establish proton therapy as a transforming  safe  and patient-focused solution  poised to redefine the global standard of care for oropharyngeal cancer.“This is important level 1 evidence that proton therapy has both a survival benefit and quality-of-life improvement for these patients and should be the standard of care for advanced cases of oropharyngeal cancer ” commented Steven Frank  M.D.  executive director of technology and innovation and deputy division head of strategic programs for Radiation Oncology. He added: “these results demonstrate the advantages of proton therapy for head and neck cancer patients  and this study could lay the foundation for increased accessibility for patients who may benefit.”Luk Herremans  Chief Market Officer of IBA Proton Therapy  commented: “This publication in The Lancet truly marks an important milestone for the field of proton radiotherapy. This trial started more than 10 years ago and has robust long term follow-up data demonstrating clear quality-of-life benefits for patients being treated with proton therapy as well as a reduced hazard of death of 42%. The publication is an important landmark to transform proton therapy into the new standard of care for those patients.”IBA congratulates Dr. Steven Frank  principal investigator at MD Anderson Cancer Center Clinical Trial Consortium  and all participating institutions and experts for their invaluable contributions to this pivotal research.IBA previously referred to this trial at prepublication stage at the Capital Markets Day and in its Third Quarter Trading Update press release.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

The rating agency classified Akropolis Group as a highly strategic subsidiary of the parent company Metodika B.V. and affirmed its BB+ long-term credit rating with a stable outlook.“The BB+ credit rating assigned by international rating agencies and maintained since 2021 demonstrates the stability of our operations and our growth prospects. This is an important assessment both for us and for our investors and business partners  providing a solid foundation to confidently continue the development and management of retail and other commercial real estate projects implemented by the company ” comments Gabrielė Sapon  CEO of Akropolis Group.The latest review by S&P Global Ratings is related to governance changes within the Vilniaus Prekyba Group  following which the group’s businesses operating in Poland  Sweden and Bulgaria will be separated into a standalone organization  while the Baltic operations will continue to be managed through UAB Vilniaus Prekyba and its subsidiaries in Lithuania.

Sanofi anticipates that the review process for the ongoing US regulatory review of tolebrutinib in non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS) will extend beyond the previously communicated US target action date of December 28  2025  and expects further guidance from the FDA by the end of the first quarter of 2026.In response to an FDA request  Sanofi has submitted an expanded access protocol for tolebrutinib in nrSPMS  underscoring the company's commitment to providing eligible patients with access to this investigational therapy. Sanofi strongly believes in the risk-benefit profile of tolebrutinib for the treatment of nrSPMS.About multiple sclerosisMS is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by accumulation of disability with shiftsin the underlying biology and dominant drivers of disability over time impacting clinicalpresentation and treatment response. ​Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis typically refers to people with a previous diagnosis of relapsing MS who have stopped experiencing relapses but continue to experience disability accumulation  in the absence of relapses.Addressing disability accumulation remains a significant unmet need in MS  as treatment options are limited.​About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target smoldering neuroinflammation  a key driver of disability progression in MS. This mechanism addresses the underlying pathology of progressive MS by targeting the inflammatory processes that contribute to neurodegeneration and disability accumulation.Tolebrutinib represents Sanofi's commitment to developing innovative treatments that address the underlying causes of neurological diseases and potentially transform the treatment landscape. Standing at the intersection of neurology and immunoscience  Sanofi is focused on improving the lives of those living with serious neuro-inflammatory and neuro-degenerative conditions including MS  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  Alzheimer’s disease  Parkinson’s disease  and age-related macular degeneration. The neurology pipeline currently has several projects in phase 3 studies across various diseases.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Results from the PERSEUS phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04458051) showed that tolebrutinib did not meet its primary endpoint in delaying time to 6-month composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP) in participants with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)  which represents 10% of the overall multiple sclerosis patient population. Based on these results  Sanofi will not pursue regulatory registration for PPMS.""We are disappointed by today’s results; however  we do believe that these results will improve our understanding of the underlying disease biology of multiple sclerosis ” said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research & Development at Sanofi. “We extend our deepest appreciation to the study participants  their families  and healthcare professionals who support our scientific and innovative vision. Our commitment to the multiple sclerosis community remains unchanged  as do our efforts to pursue novel advancements that address existing unmet needs and we remain confident in the value tolebrutinib can bring to those living with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.”Preliminary analysis showed the safety profile was consistent with previous tolebrutinib studies. As previously reported  drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an identified risk of tolebrutinib. Strict adherence to liver monitoring requirements  and prompt management of liver enzyme elevations  are important to mitigate DILI risk. Full safety and efficacy results will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.Tolebrutinib was provisionally approved in the United Arab Emirates in July 2025 for the treatment of non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and to slow disability accumulation independent of relapse activity in adults. It is currently under regulatory review in the EU and other jurisdictions worldwide. Tolebrutinib was previously granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in December 2024.Financial considerationsSanofi will conduct an impairment test in accordance with IFRS (IAS 36) on the intangible asset value attached to tolebrutinib with a status to be provided with Q4 and FY 2025 results in January 2026. The outcome of this test will have no impact to the business net income / business EPS and there is no change to the financial guidance for 2025.About multiple sclerosisMS is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by accumulation of disability with shiftsin the underlying biology and dominant drivers of disability over time impacting clinicalpresentation and treatment response. ​The clinical presentation of PPMS is characterized by a slow  insidious neurologic decline  often with a predominance of spinal cord involvement  and symptoms gradually worsen over time without periods of improvement.Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis typically refers to people with a previous diagnosis of relapsing MS who have stopped experiencing relapses but continue to experience disability accumulation  in the absence of relapses.Addressing disability accumulation remains a significant unmet need in MS  as treatment options are limited.​About PERSEUSPERSEUS (clinical study identifier: NCT04458051) is a global  double-blind  randomized phase 3 clinical study which evaluated the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib compared to placebo in participants with PPMS. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either an oral daily dose of tolebrutinib or matching placebo for up to approximately 60 months. The inclusion criteria for the study included participants aged 18–55 years old  a diagnosis of PPMS as per the 2017 revised McDonald criteria  an EDSS score ≥2.0 and ≤6.5 at screening  positive cerebrospinal fluid findings (OCBs and/or elevated IgG index) and either no access  intolerance  or perceived lack of efficacy to ocrelizumab.The primary endpoint was six-month composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP)  defined as increase over at least six months of ≥1.0 point from the baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score when the baseline score is ≤5.5  or ≥0.5 points when the baseline EDSS score is >5.5  or ≥20% from the baseline T25-FW  or ≥20% from the baseline 9-HPT. Secondary endpoints included six-month confirmed disability progression  three-month cCDP  number of newithenlarging T2 lesions as detected by MRI  time to confirmed disability improvement  change in brain volume loss  change in cognitive function  quality of life  pharmacokinetics  as well as the safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target smoldering neuroinflammation  a key driver of disability progression in MS. This mechanism addresses the underlying pathology of progressive MS by targeting the inflammatory processes that contribute to neurodegeneration and disability accumulation.Tolebrutinib represents Sanofi's commitment to developing innovative treatments that address the underlying causes of neurological diseases and potentially transform the treatment landscape. Standing at the intersection of neurology and immunoscience  Sanofi is focused on improving the lives of those living with serious neuro-inflammatory and neuro-degenerative conditions including MS  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy  Alzheimer’s disease  Parkinson’s disease  and age-related macular degeneration.

The increase was primarily due to the EUR 608.1M in net proceeds  including foreign exchange gains from the period of the close of the fundraise to the receipt of cash  from the Company’s July 2025 public offering. This was partially offset by EUR 137.9M used in operations and EUR 23.4M related to principal and interest paid on the Company’s debt facilities.On July 28  2025  Abivax completed its underwritten public offering of 11 679 400 American Depositary Shares  each representing one ordinary share  EUR 0.01 nominal value per share  of the Company  in the United States.

The farmers’ problem of course remains  with road blockades  but we shall see for how long  since when a government invites them to the prime minister’s office for dialogue and they do not go (this happened for the first time in the political history of the country)  you can hardly call it normal. So  when from this coming Friday onward and gradually until Christmas Eve people will start leaving for their villages  some to be with their families (during the holidays)  students to return home  and shops in the provinces to do good business  let’s see what the farmers at the blockades will be telling them. I point out that farmers and livestock breeders receive European — and a bit of national — subsidies of around €4 billion annually  so there should also be some sense of proportion  because no other professional sector has such support.Demands…In the meantime  I read various theories about their demands  although let me clarify that no one really knows who represents exactly which farmers at the blockades; in general the representation is somewhat blurred  which is why they do not go to Mitsotakis for dialogue. Fine  brother  at least go argue  say that he doesn’t give us what we want and we’re leaving empty-handed. In any case  I read for example that they are asking that the control of European subsidies not be transferred to the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE)  but I wonder where it should remain then — with OPEKEPE  which distributed them so well? Or maybe the feeding trough was simply cut off? At the same time they say they want the names of those who illegally received subsidies to be made public. No objection  but I think there will be laughter  since those subsidized illegally or improperly amount to about 15% of the total  that is roughly 150 000 tax ID numbers. Whatever  right? Oh  and let me not forget: our farmers are also asking that there be no cuts to the CAP in favor of “war preparations.” Let’s not forget Mother Russia!Retailers on tenterhooks  hoteliers on the brinkAt the same time  the agricultural blockades are the reason retailers are sitting on burning coals because of the farmers. Chains fear problems in the supply chain at a time of high demand. Keep in mind that many chains have centralized logistics rather than dispersed ones  such as Masoutis  which supplies from Thessaloniki. The trade bodies issuing statements fear for exports and imports under the threat of blockades at customs offices  ports  and so on. After all  it is no coincidence that yesterday all the institutional bodies of Thessaloniki (EBETH  BETH  SVE  SEVE)  in their joint statement  noted that “refusal of dialogue does not constitute a form of claim but a choice of dead end.” At the same time  economists are beginning to mutter that if this continues  it could trim the growth rate. At the same time  concern is also growing among hoteliers for mountain destinations across Greece  as “the consequences of road blockades are already evident. Booking cancellations have begun ” as they state in their letter to the Ministers of Citizen Protection  Infrastructure and Transport  and Rural Development. As the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation (POX) states in its letter: “The majority of hotel units support local production  procure products from agricultural businesses  and actively strengthen the local economy”… “However  we consider it critical that forms of mobilization do not cause disproportionate impacts on other sectors of the economy and on local society.” Take this opportunity to note that the majority of hotel businesses in mainland Greece consist of very small and small units  which have nothing to do with the more… fat cows of the islands during the summer season  operate mainly in winter  and rely on domestic tourism  with the Christmas–New Year–Epiphany period in particular generating their highest revenues. However last-minute Greeks may be  the coming week is the last for holiday bookings (which  incidentally  were going very well before the agricultural mobilizations)  hence hoteliers are now also pressing for the roads to be opened. And I close by rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar’s  saying that the first from the business world to point out the risk to the market from the agricultural mobilizations was Apostolos Vakakis  on 9/12  expressing through his statements his concern about the impact on Jumbo.The Budget and the meetingLet me tell you  however  that on Tuesday  during the Budget debate  Mitsotakis will outline a series of positive interventions concerning farmers  for example regarding electricity or even the subsidy limits for agricultural diesel. Obviously there are also issues the government does not discuss  such as minimum guaranteed product prices  which exist nowhere in Europe. In any case  the window for dialogue is not closing  because even though Mitsotakis will leave for Brussels from Wednesday through Thursday  the following weekend there is some room  provided the farmers also act more intelligently.The happy K.M. and his enemies…Now  I return briefly to the issue of the Eurogroup presidency and its aftermath. First of all  Mitsotakis appears to be… sailing in seas of happiness over this  and he shows it at every opportunity  expressing it to his interlocutors. Obviously he considers it a great success and strong promotion for himself and his government  at a time when such a victory was needed amid the grim picture surrounding OPEKEPE. The “vertical corridor” with energy matters and this outcome “fixed the situation” in the government’s image  at least temporarily  and we’ll see. As for the political points gained by Pierrakakis for the future vis-à-vis the “hypothetical suitors” within New Democracy  such as Dendias  I think it is entirely theoretical  because quite simply there has truly never been an issue of Mitsotakis within ND to date. And who would raise such an issue when ND is hovering around 30% 18 months before the elections and the second party — PASOK — at 15%? You’ll say  Karamanlis  Samaras  Venizelos and the bloc of “Mitsotakis must go and let anyone come” say these things. So what?PierrakakisAs for the acceptance of Pierrakakis’s presidency of the Eurogroup as a good and nationally beneficial development  indeed I must confess that I did not expect such generosity from the enemies or opponents of ND  nor of the minister himself. If you exclude Polakis and Varoufakis  whose negative reaction I consider absolutely normal (they have a different audience and that’s how their audience wants them)  and Akrita  who is often captivated (as a journalist) by inaccuracies  since she wrote that he would receive a high salary and without accountability as Eurogroup president (the position is entirely unpaid)  almost everyone had a good word to say. Geroulanos publicly congratulated him  although a little later… complained whether he would manage with so many obligations  and PASOK as well  through its spokesperson  said good things  as did SYRIZA under the courteous Famellos. More demonstrative  of course  were Tsipras  who called him and congratulated him  as well as G.A.P. and Venizelos. Naturally  almost all of ND and Karamanlis (Rafina)  as well as Dendias — they are bourgeois people and civilized.MPs at the Maximos MansionBefore leaving for Brussels  as mentioned earlier  K.M. will see ND MPs  many of whom are grumbling about the mobilizations. After the Budget is passed  the MPs have been invited on Wednesday at 13:00 to the Maximos Mansion for a relaxed wine and bonding. This is a repeat of last year’s scene with wines  relaxed discussion  and canapés.Theodorikakos and the shipbuilding industryYesterday afternoon Takis Theodorikakos arrived in Greece from the U.S.  where he had serious contacts with a series of important officials. Where I learn that “serious ball will be played” is in the shipbuilding sector. Beyond the Port of Elefsina  the Americans are interested in significant investments  while Koreans  who have made important strides in this sector  also enter the equation of contacts. So do not rule out synergies between Greeks  Americans  and Koreans. In general  the message the Minister of Development received from the Americans is that… they mean business  while he saw John Catsimatidis — who has a serious relationship with Trump  Archbishop Elpidophoros  etc. — met with the head of the Office of Management and Budget of the shipbuilding industry  Mr. Henry Hendricks  as well as Mr. Robert Andrews  director of shipbuilding at the National Security Council.Marinakis  investments  and MonopolyThe climate in Parliament “heated up” on Saturday when spokesperson Marinakis went to speak about the budget. He posed certain basic questions  such as how 500 000 jobs were created and how revenues are increasing while taxes are reduced and returned to citizens. “With an increase in investments ” Marinakis stressed  noting that from 2019 through next year investments increase by 96%  as opposed to Europe’s 5%. “For many years in this chamber  parties were playing ‘Monopoly ’” the spokesperson said  stressing that while the money in that game is fake  some “believed they weren’t playing a game.” We lived it and we remember it.Hatzieminas deal with Vardinogiannis–TambakakisAnd we move to the business news of the market  starting with a deal in the defense sector that — barring the unexpected — will be announced in the coming days. Well known and much discussed is Christian Hatzieminas for Theon  but the group also includes another significant company  EFA Group  which has offices in Neo Psychiko and is involved in various sectors of electronic applications and equipment for defense use. The column’s information is that EFA is expanding its activities and for this reason will proceed with a share capital increase of around €80 million. Half is said to be covered by Hatzieminas  while the rest will be covered by Giannis Vardinogiannis and Apostolos Tambakakis. Logically  A. Tambakakis participates through a fund of EOS Capital. For G. Vardinogiannis it is not known through which company he participates. Information also indicates that in the background of this cooperation looms the Athens Stock Exchange  in the Euronext era. Relations between Hatzieminas and Bouznas have been cultivated for some time  with the Frenchman’s declared intention to introduce new sectors that will be traded on “Euronext Athens.”Double pressure (from the Government and the Bank of Greece) on servicersServicers are currently under double pressure. On the one hand  servicers have not come to terms with the idea that they will pay double ENFIA in 2026 on properties they own that remain closed and unused. This is a provision that was voted at the end of 2024. For the time being  they have been given some breathing space because  in order for the double ENFIA to be applied  the Ministry of Economy must issue a ministerial decision. Once this is issued  the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) will immediately carry out the first official recording of closed properties belonging to the financial sector  in order to assess the relevant tax. The ministerial decision may prove to be the key to an informal extension  shorter or longer  since servicers do not delay putting properties on the market solely through their own fault  but also because of exhausting and time-consuming legalization procedures  despite improvements in the operation of many services  such as  for example  the Land Registry. This issue is one of those that servicers and banks will raise before the committee of the Bank of Greece. The next meeting of the committee has been scheduled for today  15 December. At the same time  the Bank of Greece is preparing a round of inspections of servicers to ascertain compliance with the EBA rules on loan classification. Yannis Stournaras believes this is an important step toward a return to normality  since if it is found that EBA rules on loan classification are being observed  the way opens for the return of cured loans to banks. In general  as recent experience shows (with Swiss-franc loans and step-up loans)  supervision places particular emphasis on loan classification by banks and servicers.“Swiss scissors” by the hand of…PWCBefore the end of 2025  the arrangements for Swiss-franc loans will have been submitted to Parliament and will concern loans totaling €2.5 billion. However  one obstacle to the immediate implementation of the institutional framework from the new year is the platform that will calculate the haircut on the loan  which will be carried out on the basis of the exchange rate of the Swiss franc against the euro. The exchange rate will be adjusted based on the income and asset criteria of borrowers  and its construction has been assigned to PricewaterhouseCoopers  which will follow the well-trodden path of the out-of-court mechanism in creating it. Completion of the platform will take at least two months  say those familiar with such tools. It is recalled that  as regards the regulation of Swiss-franc loans  the cap that linked the haircut to the value of the collateral was removed.F. Karavias packs his bags for IndiaEurobank continues its penetration of the Indian market. The bank obtained the long-awaited license to open a representative office in Mumbai. In fact  the opening of the office is scheduled for next February  at which the bank’s management  under CEO Fokion Karavias  will be present. At the same time  the bank has already created a technology hub in the city of Pune  where it employs around 150 programmers and IT engineers. Pune is one of the largest and most important technology centers in India. The city is known as a major IT hub and hosts many large technology parks  such as the International Tech Park Pune and Magarpatta CyberCity. The broader ties  due of course to a shareholder  between Eurobank and India were also evident from F. Karavias’s presence at the recent reception of Indian businessman Taizoon Khorakiwala at the Ekali Club for his 10 years in Greece.Citi on Greece: You’re doing wellFrom a LinkedIn post by Citi’s Vice Chairman for Banking and Public Sector  Jay Collins  we learned what was discussed at his recent meeting with Kostis Hatzidakis in New York  in the presence of the bank’s CEO in Greece  Aemilios Kyriakou. The Citi executive notes in his post that he acknowledged the significant reforms the country has undertaken in recent years  such as in taxation  fiscal policy  digital transition  and privatizations. He makes special reference to the country’s ability to attract foreign investment  adding that the reforms undertaken have borne fruit in an impressive way  and concludes that this is a significant outcome  since six years ago no one could have imagined Greece borrowing at the same levels as Italy.Upgrade of A. Vlades at Piraeus BankLast week  certain changes were made to the board of directors of Piraeus Bank. The most interesting was the promotion of Alexandros Vlades — the New Zealander who is the representative of the bank’s main shareholder  John Paulson — to the board’s vice chairmanship. He succeeded Karel De Boeck  who departed  as did David R. Hexter  having exceeded the nine-year limit provided for by the corporate governance framework. Both De Boeck and Hexter  who assumed their duties in 2016  left without being replaced  and thus the board is now composed of 11 members and has a three-year term. The boards of banks will gradually undergo similar lifting  as some members joined during the time of recapitalizations and the deep crisis of the banking system and are now closing their cycle.Critical decisions for Viva WalletViva Wallet is entering a period of crucial developments. Management has called shareholders to an extraordinary General Assembly aimed at taking decisions that will shape the company’s strategic course for the next three years. Given the hard confrontation that preceded between the Karoni side and JP Morgan  the stance the investment giant will take at the General Assembly is awaited with interest. The meeting  which takes place today  15 December 2025  concerns issues of strategic development  operational strengthening  and international expansion of the group. Specifically  at the center of the agenda is the Strategic Review Period  as provided for by the Shareholders’ Agreement  with shareholders being called upon to evaluate proposals that will determine the future operating and development framework of the company. At the same time  the updating of the Business Plan will be discussed  which constitutes a key guide for Viva Wallet’s future development. Shareholders  in particular  will decide on new guidelines  taking into account market needs and technological developments. Of particular importance is the approval of the Strategic Framework 2026–2028  which is expected to reflect the company’s vision and investment priorities for the coming years  as well as the stock option program. Finally  one of the most important strategic directions is put on the table: the expansion of Viva’s activities into the United States  one of the issues at the heart of the hard confrontation between Karoni–Antypas (WRL) and JPM.Milena Pappa considers ordering two more containershipsAfter seven years  the Pappa family is dynamically returning to the container market. Oceanbulk Maritime  under Milena’s control  after placing orders for the construction of two 3 100-TEU feeder vessels in China  with deliveries at the end of 2027 and the beginning of 2028  is already considering ordering another two ships at the New Dayang shipyard. The cost is estimated at around $46 million each  an investment that  as insiders say  is “heads we win  tails we win.” This return is no coincidence  as the charter market for smaller feeder vessels is performing extremely well. Rates for 2 800-TEU ships have climbed to $39 000/day  for 3 500-TEU ships to $44 200  at the highest levels of the last three years. In other words  whoever invests now is sitting on a golden chair. Milena is taking into her hands a part of the family empire that had been “frozen” since 2018  when Oceanbulk Container Carriers had sold or converted its large 10 000–11 000-TEU container ships. Now  however  the timing is different: demand for smaller vessels is skyrocketing  fleet renewal is becoming imperative. And while the feeder market is simmering  Oceanbulk does not forget bulkers: it recently closed three Kamsarmax deals  showing that the goal is clear — to have a presence wherever there is profit. In other words  the Pappa family is re-entering the game like an investor on Wall Street.Why Ioannis Martinos is now looking toward dry bulkIoannis Martinos is making a move with a clear strategic imprint  with Signal Maritime Services crossing the threshold of dry bulk for the first time  through an investment in Bluepool. The company  which has been identified with its performance in Aframax tankers  is expanding its footprint at a time when the shipping market is steadily moving toward consolidation. Martinos is not entering to buy ships; he is entering to buy a “platform”: management  network  know-how  and technology. The move is anything but random. Signal Maritime Services  after establishing its name in Aframax tankers and seeing its pool post above-average market performance  is opening up to cargo vessels. And it is doing so at a time when the market is beginning to smell consolidation. According to analysts  this is a classic risk diversification move. Tankers had a strong year  but the cycle does not last forever. Dry bulk offers different exposure  different timing  and — above all — access to a broader investment story. The message of “strong cooperation” is addressed not only to the market but also to shipowners. Signal and Bluepool want to present themselves as the commercial managers of the upcoming consolidation: fewer pools  larger sizes  more transparency  and better tools. Those who cannot invest on their own in technology and data will go to those who can. Ioannis Martinos is betting that the future is not the lone shipowner  but strong schemes with critical mass.Intense activity in second-hand sales and purchasesThe presence of Greek interests in the secondary (second-hand) market was also strong. Greek buyers were behind the purchase of two under-construction Suezmax vessels  HD HYUNDAI SAMHO 8252 and 8253 (157 000 dwt)  being built at a total price of $195 million  with delivery in June and July 2026. At the same time  Greek-interest Global Ship Lease acquired the post-Panamax containerships LOTUS A and CYPRESS  with a capacity of 8 586 TEU  built in 2010 and 2011 at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in South Korea. The price was set at $30 million per vessel  with the ships accompanied by existing charter contracts. On the sales front  Greek interests appeared particularly active across all segments. The Capesize MONTECRISTO (180 000 dwt  built 2005 at Imabari) was sold to Chinese buyers for $20 million. The Suezmax OLYMPIC FUTURE (155 000 dwt  2004  Namura) changed hands at $30 million  while the MR AEGEA (51 000 dwt  2008  SLS)  equipped with a scrubber  was sold for $14.5 million. Additional sales in the dry cargo sector included the Panamax STAR EMILY (76 000 dwt  2004  Tsuneishi) at levels slightly above $8 million and the IVESTOS 3 (74 000 dwt  2007  Hudong-Zhonghua) at $9 million. The Supramax LEONIDAS (53 000 dwt  2005  Xiamen) was sold for $8.5 million  while the Handysize BC VANESSA (31 755 dwt  2010  Saiki) changed ownership at an undisclosed price. Finally  in the LPG sector  Greek interests were behind the sale of the LPG AEOLIAN PEARL (54 675 dwt / 82 461 cbm  built in 2016 at Hyundai Heavy Industries)  which was acquired by Foresight Group Services Ltd FZCO  with the financial terms of the transaction not being disclosed.The safe removal of explosive materials from LavrioAt the Ministry of Defense  attention has been focused for weeks on Lavrio  where the project of decontamination and the safe removal of explosive materials from the old facilities site must proceed. The forthcoming tender is expected to open in the next period. The political leadership has requested a clear reduction in cost compared to previous procedures. At the Pentagon they say the project is critical: it requires specialized know-how  strict safety protocols  and full compliance with the legal framework. Thus  even before the call is published  a great deal of work has been done to rationalize costs and to set strict participation criteria. Within this framework  EAS – Hellenic Defense Systems is among those interested who are closely monitoring developments. The company  according to people familiar with the matter  is moving discreetly and institutionally  following to the letter the conditions and directions set by the ministry. From the ministry’s side  however  they are keeping a low profile. They want to see who will ultimately pass the required filters  as the technical specifications for the project are considered demanding. At the same time  the reduction of the budget has created additional pressure on all interested parties  who are being called upon to submit more economical and fully documented proposals. What is emerging is that the upcoming tender in Lavrio will constitute a small test for the new philosophy of the Ministry of Defense  which seeks to combine safety and technical adequacy with strict fiscal discipline. It remains to be seen who will meet the requirements and who will ultimately undertake the project  which is considered pivotal for the area — and for the leadership’s profile of effectiveness.€70 million for the “greening” of Eleftherios VenizelosShortly before his departure from the helm of Athens International Airport (AIA)  CEO Yiannis Paraschis — who also holds the position of president of SETE — presented last Friday AIA’s “Route 25” program  which was completed for the country’s largest airport 25 years earlier than the European target for airports. AIA announced the “Route 25” plan in December 2019  which constitutes its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon balance by 2025. From 1/1/2026  100% of the airport company’s electricity needs will be produced within its facilities from photovoltaic systems  with battery energy storage for maximum self-consumption. This “green” energy supplies buildings  electric buses and operational vehicles  as well as heat pumps that replace natural gas. The result? The energy produced corresponds to the consumption of 22 000 households or to emissions reductions equivalent to a forest 1.5 times the area of the airport. “Route 2025” required an investment of approximately €70 million.The outperformance of “stationery” stocks  the two “explosive” mid caps  and what is happening with water companiesShares of the Viohalco group have embarked on a sustained rally  constantly reaching new peaks. The parent company has achieved an 8×9 streak with cumulative gains of nearly 19%  leading it for the first time to the vicinity of €12  while its market capitalization now exceeds €3 billion. ElvalHalcor has recorded gains of 13.6% over the last three trading sessions and is setting course for €4  a level it has not seen since October 2007. Two mid-cap stocks also closed at record levels. AVAX reached €2.7 for the first time in about 16 years  specifically since January 2010. The strengthening of the share in 2025 is impressive  approaching +77.5%. Buying interest is strong  with turnover exceeding €1 million over the last three sessions. In addition  the construction company’s market value exceeds €400 million. Profile closed at a new all-time high  recording its best session of the last 17 months with last Friday’s +6.4%. It closed at €7.81 and nearly touched €8 at the day’s highs. Strong gains were recorded by the shares of water companies  which resurfaced due to the government plan to address water scarcity. At the same time  they are benefiting from moves to strengthen their free float  with a characteristic case being the placement carried out by EYATH for 5% of its share capital. There is also intense rumor-mongering about increases in tariffs  which have not risen for more than a decade. Based on the above  EYDAP rose by 3.9% to €7.75  a price that constitutes a three-year high. EYATH returned above €4 with a jump of 7.25%  its best daily performance since last July.The Christmas miracle for the “small” players of the marketAlongside the confidence radiated by the +42% return of the General Index since the beginning of the year  the first moves have appeared in small- and mid-cap stocks on the Athens stock market. These moves sometimes reflect genuine investment interest and concern companies and sectors that are growing  while other times they stem from market lobbies seeking to exploit the generally positive climate in the markets. There are also mandatory moves to improve liquidity and free float  while all this is linked to the coming Friday of the “three witches ” with the expiration of December derivatives (Triple Witching) and the rebalancing of the FTSE and EuroStoxx indices at the close of the session. The European Central Bank’s announcements next Thursday do not appear to hide any surprise regarding euro interest rates. By contrast  the Bank of Japan has much to say and to warn about the future of the carry trade in global markets (the end of cheap borrowing in yen for investments in stock markets). From the day after tomorrow  Piraeus Bank shares will not be traded due to the corporate transformation of the merger of the subsidiary into the parent company. The new shares will begin trading shortly before Christmas  next Monday  22 December.The most profitable investment of 2025As this year comes to an end  reviews of investment strategies and choices begin. It was a year full of upheavals in the world’s stock markets. The absolute winner of 2025 is silver  which this year records an impressive rise of +113% since the beginning of the year  leaving behind even the much-discussed gold  which also posted a notable return of +63%. Shares of rare earths and uranium recorded impressive gains of +87% and +75% respectively. Geopolitical tension and the efforts of Western economies to reduce dependence on China for rare metals further strengthen this sector. By contrast  Bitcoin this year and to date records losses of -3%  while the U.S. indices S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are limited to moderate returns of +16% and +20% respectively. One should not ignore the outperformance of emerging stock markets (+31%)  which may signal a shift in global investment flows. As for silver  markets highlight its dual nature not only as a precious metal but also as a raw material for modern industrial production — especially in the field of renewable energy sources and more specifically for photovoltaic panels.Halcyon days for bank stocks on the NYSELast week was disappointing for the much-vaunted technology stocks on Wall Street. The Nasdaq Composite ended the week down -1.6%  following Friday’s plunge of -1.1%  triggered by Oracle but with consequences across all technology stocks. Suddenly  there appears to be a reversal of the trends of the entire year. The heavyweight industrial index  the Dow Jones  gained 503 points  or +1% on the week. Three stocks in the financial services sector stood out: Goldman Sachs  Visa  and American Express. Their upward movement was attributed to the FED’s interest rate cuts but — mainly — to the promise of easing supervisory regulations by the Trump administration. Bank of America’s share recorded its first record close since the… distant… 2006  when we had the halcyon days of the banking sector just before the real estate bubble burst (subprime).
