54298,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/16/europe-establishes-ukraine-reparations-commission-amid-push-to-end-war,Europe establishes Ukraine reparations commission amid push to end war,The International Claims Commission is tasked with assessing reparation claims and determining amounts to be paid.,The International Claims Commission is tasked with assessing reparation claims and determining amounts to be paid.Top European officials have agreed to launch an international commission to compensate Kyiv for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russia’s continuing war on Ukraine.The International Claims Commission for Ukraine  established in a treaty signed by 35 countries at Tuesday’s conference in The Hague  is to assess and decide claims for reparations  including any amounts to be paid out.Attending the summit with leaders including Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said making Russia pay for its crimes was “exactly where the real path to peace begins”.“This war and Russia’s responsibility for it must become a clear example so that others learn not to choose aggression ” he said.“We must make Russia accept that there are rules in the world.”The commission was launched during a United States-led diplomatic push to end the war. US President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that an agreement was “closer than ever” after he talked with the leaders of Ukraine  France  Germany  the United Kingdom and NATO.Reparations a ‘path to peace’The launch of the Netherlands-based commission  coordinated by the 46-member Council of Europe  follows the establishment about two years ago of a Register of Damages  which has already received more than 80 000 reparations claims from Ukraine.Details on how any damages would be paid are yet to be worked out with discussions revolving around using Russian assets frozen by the EU  supplemented by member contributions.AdvertisementThe EU has indefinitely frozen hundreds of billions of euros of Russian funds held in Europe and is considering using the money to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia and rebuild.Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel stressed the importance of reparations in resolving the conflict  calling the establishment of the commission “a big step”.“Without accountability  a conflict cannot be fully resolved. And part of that accountability is also paying damages that have been done ” he said.Plans for loan to UkraineEU leaders are under pressure to reach an agreement on exactly what to do with the frozen Russian assets at a summit that starts on Thursday.They are seeking ways to fund a loan to Kyiv that would be paid back by any eventual Russian reparations to Ukraine. Belgium  home to the international deposit organisation Euroclear  which holds most of the frozen Russian assets  is opposed to the proposal due to its potential legal repercussions.The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction in Ukraine from damage inflicted in the war up to December 2024 at $524bn – nearly three times Ukraine’s economic output that year.That figure does not take into account the damage caused by Moscow’s intensified campaign targeting Ukrainian utilities and other critical infrastructure this year.,negative,0.02,0.43,0.56,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['Ukraine reparations commission', 'Europe', 'push', 'war', 'European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel', 'Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'United States-led diplomatic push', 'The International Claims Commission', 'Top European officials', 'international deposit organisation', 'potential legal repercussions', 'other critical infrastructure', 'The World Bank', 'eventual Russian reparations', 'frozen Russian assets', 'international commission', 'The Hague', 'United Kingdom', 'Ukrainian utilities', 'reparation claims', 'Russian funds', 'Netherlands-based commission', '80,000 reparations claims', 'clear example', '46-member Council', 'member contributions', 'economic output', 'intensified campaign', 'real path', 'continuing war', 'EU leaders', 'amounts', 'Kyiv', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'damage', 'Ukraine', 'treaty', '35 countries', 'Tuesday', 'conference', 'summit', 'crimes', 'peace', 'responsibility', 'others', 'aggression', 'rules', 'reporters', 'Monday', 'agreement', 'France', 'Germany', 'NATO', 'launch', 'establishment', 'Register', 'Details', 'discussions', 'Advertisement', 'euros', 'money', 'importance', 'conflict', 'accountability', 'part', 'Plans', 'loan', 'pressure', 'Thursday', 'ways', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'proposal', 'cost', 'reconstruction', 'December', 'figure', 'Moscow']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,aljazeera.com
54299,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629531-tusk-us-eu-frozen-russian-assets/,US warned EU against stealing Russia’s assets – Tusk,The US warned the EU that seizing frozen Russian assets would undermine peace talks with Moscow  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Washington said the move would undermine talks with Moscow on the Ukraine peace deal  according to the Polish PMThe US has told the EU to “leave the [frozen] Russian assets alone” as any appropriation of the funds could undermine talks with Moscow in the Ukraine peace talks  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has claimed.After the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022  Kiev’s Western backers froze approximately $300 billion in Moscow’s sovereign assets  of which $246 billion has been immobilized by EU member states.Discussions concerning the immobilized Russian assets have intensified within the bloc in recent weeks after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed using the funds to back a “reparations loan” to Ukraine.Speaking following a meeting between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Berlin on Monday  Tusk stated that there was a “very clear” difference of opinion between Washington and Brussels on the issue of the frozen Russian funds.“The Americans are saying ‘Leave these Russian assets alone’ ” according to the Polish prime minister. According to him  Washington is concerned that if the EU seized the immobilized funds  Russia would take a less amenable negotiating position in talks to end the Ukraine conflict.Last week  EU member states voted for the latest temporary freeze on Russian sovereign funds. The bloc’s leadership had to invoke emergency powers to overcome the opposition of member states  including Hungary and Slovakia.Belgium has also expressed concerns that it would be left in the lurch by the bloc in the face of Russian lawsuits. The Euroclear depositary based in the country holds the bulk of the frozen assets.Moscow has condemned any use of its immobilized funds as “theft.” On Friday  the Bank of Russia announced that it was filing a lawsuit seeking $230 billion in compensation from Euroclear.On Monday  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that an “urge to steal must be genetic in many of our Western ‘colleagues’ ” citing the seizure of Iranian and Venezuelan assets by the West.,negative,0.0,0.35,0.64,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['US', 'EU', 'assets', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'less amenable negotiating position', 'latest temporary freeze', 'Ukraine peace deal', 'frozen] Russian assets', 'frozen Russian funds', 'The Euroclear depositary', 'EU member states', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Ukraine peace talks', 'Polish PM', 'Russian lawsuits', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'The US', 'The Americans', 'Venezuelan assets', 'Western backers', 'recent weeks', 'reparations loan', 'US negotiators', 'clear” difference', 'Ukraine conflict', 'emergency powers', 'Western ‘colleagues', 'immobilized funds', 'Washington', 'move', 'Moscow', 'appropriation', 'escalation', 'hostilities', 'February', 'Kiev', 'Discussions', 'bloc', 'meeting', 'Ukrainian', 'Berlin', 'Monday', 'opinion', 'Brussels', 'issue', 'leadership', 'opposition', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Belgium', 'concerns', 'lurch', 'face', 'country', 'bulk', 'use', 'Friday', 'Bank', 'compensation', 'urge', 'seizure', 'Iranian']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,rt.com
54300,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/how-europe-could-use-billions-in-frozen-russian-assets-to-fund-ukraines-war-effort-and-why-its-so-risky-272087,How Europe could use billions in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s war effort – and why it’s so risky,Ukraine is desperate for more funds to defend itself. But using Russia’s frozen assets could upset the delicate system underpinning Europe’s financial system.,Most people outside of banking won’t have heard of Euroclear. It’s a Brussels-based settlement provider that enables the transfer of ownership of securities between seller and buyer. The firm is the focal point of a major geopolitical confrontation between Russia and the European Union.The controversy stems from an EU initiative to leverage frozen Russian assets held at Euroclear to finance Ukraine’s war effort. In response  Russia’s central bank has filed a lawsuit in Moscow seeking damages for the freezing of its assets.This legal manoeuvre represents an attempt to seize assets worth €17 billion (£14.89 billion) held by Euroclear in Russia on behalf of its clients and pursue further claims on similar Euroclear assets in other jurisdictions not part of the international sanctions imposed on Russia. These could include China  Hong Kong and states in the Gulf and Central Asia.To appreciate the implications of these competing claims  it is essential to understand Euroclear’s role and origins.Euroclear functions as a central securities depository (CSD). These are invisible  yet vital  pieces of infrastructure for financial markets. The function of a CSD is to transfer ownership of securities – titles of ownership of financial assets – from seller to buyer once payment is confirmed.Euroclear is an international CSD. This means it handles not just equities traded on a particular stock exchange like national CSDs do  but a vast range of financial instruments across many markets and jurisdictions.This includes Eurobonds  supranational agency bonds  government and corporate debt  money market instruments  asset-backed securities and more. It also provides critical collateral management and securities borrowing and lending services.In 2024  it processed 331 million transactions worth €1 162 trillion (£877 billion) and held more than €40 trillion of clients’ assets.This privileged position depends on trust. Depositories such as Euroclear process ownership changes via book-entry transfer. That means assets are held by the CSDs and recorded in a database of holdings  which confers legal ownership of the titles. This ensures uncontested and efficient transactions and reduces the risk of one side of a trade not fulfilling its obligations.If the trust that allows market participants to assign their assets to a CSD like Euroclear for safekeeping falters  the book-entry transfer system breaks down and markets suffer.Risks of EU’s planThe EU’s plan to use frozen Russian assets as collateral for loans to Ukraine introduces significant risks. If market participants fear politically motivated asset seizures  they may relocate holdings to jurisdictions perceived as safer. This could potentially weaken Euroclear’s position and destabilise the markets it serves.The recent EU proposals have evolved to avoid outright seizure of the Russian assets. Instead it has opted for freezing them indefinitely. Under this arrangement  legal ownership remains with Euroclear’s Russian clients  while Euroclear uses these assets as collateral for loans to the EU to finance Ukraine.But this raises important questions. What happens if sanctions are lifted or Russia’s legal challenges are successful? Could Euroclear demand immediate repayment from the EU? And could Euroclear withstand the financial strain of restoring all these assets to their Russian owners en masse? These uncertainties are a threat to Euroclear’s stability – and  by extension  the smooth operation of the global markets it serves.Even unsuccessful litigation on the side of Euroclear’s Russian clients could freeze Euroclear’s holdings at national CSDs in non-sanction jurisdictions for prolonged periods. This could create operational problems for Euroclear and unsettle its clients.The European Commission has suggested that Euroclear compensate clients for Russian-related losses using its immobilised Russian funds. But this would mean fewer funds available for loans to the EU for financing Ukraine.EPA/Ida Marie OdgaardThe issues above are further complicated by Euroclear’s history and its part in the vast multitrillion dollar Eurodollar and Eurobond markets for offshore currency deposits and debt securities. Founded in 1968 by Morgan Guaranty Trust in Brussels  Euroclear supported the burgeoning Eurodollar and Eurobond markets.These markets were based on offshore dollar pools that included Soviet dollar deposits seeking refuge from US jurisdiction during the cold war.Belgium and Euroclear had an interest in nurturing Soviet trust. This was formalised in the 1989 Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union–USSR bilateral investment treaty that is still in force between Belgium and Russia.The treaty guarantees fair treatment  protection against expropriation  free transfer of funds and provides for dispute resolution and arbitration mechanisms. Allowing Russian assets to be used as loan collateral may be in breach of that treaty.European financial leadership under threatEurope’s world leadership in offshore currency and debt markets and the international financial infrastructures that support them) was achieved in the 1950s and 1960s due to perceived political risks in the US. But it’s now threatened by similar perceived risks in Europe if this plan to leverage Russian assets against its will is realised.Euroclear is a rare example of a European global financial services champion which could provide valuable economic returns to fund Europe’s future ability to counter external threats. This could be both directly  through the generation of revenues and taxes  as well as indirectly.Euroclear acts as part of a backbone for the EU’s financial infrastructures. It helps make Europe a central and critical part of the global financial system  enhancing market integration in Europe and across the globe  and channelling large reserves of international capital into the European financial system.A misstep now could damage that competitive advantage  as well as cause financial turmoil and – in the longer run – potentially divert asset flows away from Europe to other  competing jurisdictions.,negative,0.0,0.07,0.93,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'war effort', 'Europe', 'billions', 'Ukraine', '1989 Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union–USSR bilateral investment treaty', 'vast multitrillion dollar Eurodollar', 'Euroclear process ownership changes', 'Brussels-based settlement provider', 'major geopolitical confrontation', 'particular stock exchange', 'supranational agency bonds', 'Ida Marie Odgaard', 'offshore dollar pools', 'Soviet dollar deposits', 'The European Commission', 'offshore currency deposits', 'money market instruments', 'critical collateral management', 'Morgan Guaranty Trust', 'international financial infrastr', 'European Union', 'book-entry transfer system', 'European financial leadership', 'recent EU proposals', 'central securities depository', 'frozen Russian assets', 'similar Euroclear assets', 'vast range', 'burgeoning Eurodollar', 'financial instruments', 'world leadership', 'central bank', 'Central Asia', 'market participants', 'financial strain', 'Russian owners', 'Soviet trust', 'financial assets', 'Most people', 'focal point', 'war effort', 'legal manoeuvre', 'Hong Kong', 'vital, pieces', 'financial markets', 'corporate debt', 'lending services', '331 million transactions', 'efficient transactions', 'safekeeping falters', 'asset seizures', 'outright seizure', 'important questions', 'legal challenges', 'immediate repayment', 'smooth operation', 'unsuccessful litigation', 'prolonged periods', 'operational problems', 'Russian-related losses', 'US jurisdiction', 'cold war', 'fair treatment', 'free transfer', 'dispute resolution', 'arbitration mechanisms', 'Russian funds', 'international sanctions', 'asset-backed securities', 'securities borrowing', 'legal ownership', 'debt securities', 'Russian clients', 'loan collateral', 'national CSDs', 'many markets', 'global markets', 'fewer funds', 'Eurobond markets', 'debt markets', 'international CSD', 'other jurisdictions', 'competing claims', 'privileged position', 'one side', 'significant risks', 'sanction jurisdictions', 'EU initiative', 'clients’ assets', 'banking', 'seller', 'buyer', 'firm', 'controversy', 'Ukraine', 'response', 'lawsuit', 'Moscow', 'damages', 'freezing', 'attempt', 'behalf', 'China', 'states', 'Gulf', 'implications', 'role', 'origins', 'invisible', 'infrastructure', 'function', 'titles', 'equities', 'Eurobonds', 'government', '€40 trillion', 'Depositories', 'database', 'holdings', 'uncontested', 'trade', 'obligations', 'plan', 'loans', 'arrangement', 'masse', 'uncertainties', 'threat', 'stability', 'extension', 'financing', 'issues', 'history', 'refuge', 'interest', 'force', 'protection', 'expropriation', 'breach']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,theconversation.com

Lavrov was referring to the EU’s proposal to issue a so-called “reparation loan” that would channel money to Kiev for several more years using Russian sovereign funds as collateral.Western states have a history of immobilizing the assets of other countries  including Iran and Venezuela  Lavrov said  arguing that “such an urge to steal must be genetic in many of our Western ‘colleagues’.”Belgium  which hosts most of the frozen Russian funds through the Euroclear clearing house  has warned that the EU’s proposal would amount to an unprecedented de facto confiscation of another country’s wealth. Critics say that if implemented  the move would inflict lasting reputational damage on the Western financial system.Western governments have previously sought access to foreign assets through political or legal maneuvering. During his first term  US President Donald Trump recognized Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Guaido as the country’s legitimate leader. Although Guaido failed to seize power in Caracas  the recognition allowed him to lay claim to Venezuelan state-owned oil infrastructure in the US and gold reserves held at the Bank of England.Iranian assets were targeted through civil lawsuits in US courts. One such case alleged Tehran’s involvement in the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks – a baseless claim which Iran did not even contest.Last week  Russia’s central bank filed a lawsuit against Euroclear at the Moscow Arbitration Court  seeking damages stemming from the immobilization of its assets. Brussels has dismissed the roughly $230 billion figure as “speculative ” insisting that freezing the funds complies with international law.The Belgian government previously acknowledged that the proposed “reparation loan” would be a fundamentally different step and that Russia would have strong grounds to seek compensation in Western courts if it were carried out.,negative,0.0,0.45,0.54,negative,0.0,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'theft', 'Lavrov', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'unprecedented de facto confiscation', 'Venezuelan state-owned oil infrastructure', 'US President Donald Trump', 'lasting reputational damage', 'Venezuelan opposition figure', 'September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks', 'Western financial system', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'Moscow Arbitration Court', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Russian funds', 'foreign assets', '$230 billion figure', 'US courts', 'Western states', 'Western ‘colleagues', 'Western governments', 'Western courts', 'European leaders', 'state broadcaster', 'broader denunciation', 'European Union', 'reparation loan', 'other countries', 'legal maneuvering', 'first term', 'legitimate leader', 'gold reserves', 'civil lawsuits', 'international law', 'Belgian government', 'different step', 'strong grounds', 'Iranian assets', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Juan Guaido', 'baseless claim', 'central bank', 'plans', 'Kiev', 'theft', 'blood', 'remarks', 'interview', 'IRIB', 'Monday', 'part', 'approach', 'proposal', 'money', 'several', 'years', 'collateral', 'history', 'urge', 'Belgium', 'country', 'wealth', 'Critics', 'move', 'access', 'political', 'power', 'Caracas', 'recognition', 'England', 'case', 'Tehran', 'involvement', 'damages', 'immobilization', 'Brussels', 'compensation']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,rt.com

The move has been strongly condemned within the bloc and by legal scholars  while Moscow labeled any attempt to tamper with its assets as “theft.”Speaking ahead of a ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday  Krichbaum threatened those member states opposing the scheme with severe financial and economic consequences.“Any country that now rejects this proposal for a reparations loan must also be aware that this is likely to have a negative impact on its credit rating ” he claimed.Any alternative to the “reparations loan” scheme would be costly for EU countries  Krichbaum warned.

Recent media reports suggest the US leader is prepared to offer Kiev NATO-style  Congressionally-approved security guarantees if it agrees to territorial concessions to Russia.Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky  however  reiterated on Monday that Kiev will not recognize Donbass as Russian “neither de jure nor de facto.”Other European proposals include “significant support to Ukraine to build its armed forces ” backing Ukraine’s accession to the European Union  and efforts to “invest in the future prosperity of Ukraine” by using frozen Russian sovereign assets.

Moscow has condemned the freeze as illegal and called any use of the funds “theft ” after European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen proposed using the money to back a loan to Ukraine.Speaking to the Patriota YouTube channel on Tuesday  Orban said EU leaders were “chasing their money” after spending heavily on the conflict and having previously assured voters it “won’t cost them a single penny” because support for Ukraine would be financed from Russian assets rather than taxpayers.Orban said that if taxpayers end up footing the bill after all those promises  it could trigger an “explosive realization in Western Europe” and the “immediate fall of several governments.”He argued that EU leaders are now trying to secure financing “outside taxpayers’ pockets ” pointing to frozen Russian assets as the target and warning of political trouble if Brussels fails to obtain them.Orban has previously accused EU officials of “raping European law in broad daylight ” by invoking Article 122 to bypass his country’s potential veto  and said Budapest would take the matter to the bloc’s top court. He also noted that Washington opposes the confiscation and wants the issue handled as part of a broader settlement with Moscow.Russia’s central bank has filed a lawsuit against Belgium-based depositary Euroclear  which holds most of its assets. The EU insists that freezing the funds complies with international law  however  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has warned that using the money to back a loan to Kiev raises legal risks for the country.International financial institutions  including the European Central Bank and the IMF  have also cautioned that using immobilized sovereign assets could undermine confidence in the euro.,neutral,0.01,0.55,0.43,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['Russian cash', 'EU', 'collapse', 'Orban', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian central bank assets', 'emergency treaty clause', 'Patriota YouTube channel', 'Belgium-based depositary Euroclear', 'European Commission head', 'European Central Bank', 'International financial institutions', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU nations’ leaders', 'Hungarian PM', 'European law', 'international law', 'sovereign assets', 'EU leaders', 'political backlash', 'qualified majority', 'single penny', 'explosive realization', 'Western Europe', 'immediate fall', 'political trouble', 'broad daylight', 'potential veto', 'top court', 'broader settlement', 'legal risks', 'EU officials', 'several governments', 'taxpayers', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'order', 'collapse', 'Article 122', 'approval', 'unanimity', 'Moscow', 'freeze', 'funds', 'money', 'loan', 'Tuesday', 'conflict', 'voters', 'support', 'bill', 'promises', 'financing', 'pockets', 'target', 'warning', 'Brussels', 'country', 'Budapest', 'matter', 'Washington', 'confiscation', 'issue', 'part', 'lawsuit', 'Kiev', 'IMF', 'confidence']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,rt.com

It is not clear how that critical part of the process will work in practice.The reparations mechanism is being coordinated via the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe  the 46-nation group protecting human rights on the continent.EU leaders are under pressure to reach an agreement on what to do with the frozen Russian assets at a summit starting Thursday.They are seeking ways to fund a loan to Kiev which  under the proposal  would be paid back by any eventual Russian reparations to Ukraine.But while the plan has the strong backing of many member states  including heavyweight Germany - it has drawn fierce opposition so far from Belgium.The country is home to international deposit organisation Euroclear - which holds most of the Russian assets - and has so far rejected the proposal because of potential legal repercussions.The debate over frozen assets comes alongside efforts to end the Ukraine war  which U.S. President Donald Trump said was ""closer now than we have been ever.""After two days of talks with senior U.S. officials in Berlin  Zelensky said negotiations were ""not easy"" but brought ""real progress"" on the question of security guarantees.European leaders on Monday proposed a European-led ""multinational force"" with U.S. support to enforce a potential peace deal.""Discussions on accountability and reparation and reconstruction must be part of the peace talks "" Council of Europe President Alain Berset told reporters on arrival at the meeting in The Hague.",neutral,0.0,0.94,0.05,mixed,0.1,0.35,0.55,True,English,"['key Ukrainian city', 'Russia', 'control', 'Kupiansk', 'U.S. President Donald Trump', 'EU foreign policy chief', 'senior U.S. officials', 'Ukrainian Presidential Press Service', 'U.S. negotiators', 'U.S. support', 'The International Claims Commission', 'President Alain Berset', 'state news agency', 'Top European officials', 'many member states', 'international deposit organisation', 'potential legal repercussions', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Zapad military group', 'two nearby localities', 'European-led ""multinational force', 'potential peace deal', 'Russian Sixth Army', 'new European body', 'frozen Russian assets', 'key Ukrainian city', 'eventual Russian reparations', 'international body', 'EU leaders', 'Russian army', 'frozen assets', 'The Hague', 'Ukrainian forces', 'Ukrainian soldiers', 'European leaders', '46-nation group', 'two days', 'Russian forces', 'key city', 'eventual reparations', 'handout photograph', 'mobile phone', 'road sign', 'Kharkiv region', 'small groups', 'rail hub', 'several districts', 'full-scale offensive', 'Kaja Kallas', 'third step', 'compensation fund', 'human rights', 'strong backing', 'heavyweight Germany', 'fierce opposition', 'security guarantees', 'Russian invasion', 'several areas', 'reparations mechanism', 'video message', 'Leonid Sharov', 'Diplomatic efforts', 'high-level summit', 'critical part', 'Strasbourg-based Council', 'real progress', 'peace talks', 'northeast Ukraine', 'Ukraine war', 'Kupiansk area', '80,000 claims', 'control', 'MOSCOW', 'Dec.', 'front', 'entrance', 'Tuesday', 'head', 'TASS', 'conflict', 'Berlin', 'Monday', 'plans', 'November', 'Friday', 'troops', 'Kiev', 'recapture', 'visit', 'breakthrough', 'February', '20 percent', 'country', 'south', 'tens', 'billions', 'euros', 'amount', 'byZelensky', 'establishment', 'setting', 'Register', 'Damages', 'individuals', 'organisations', 'process', 'practice', 'continent', 'pressure', 'agreement', 'ways', 'loan', 'proposal', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'debate', 'negotiations', 'question', 'Discussions', 'accountability', 'reconstruction', 'reporters', 'arrival', 'meeting']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,hurriyetdailynews.com

(AP Photo/Omar Havana  File)BRUSSELS -- European Union envoys worked on Tuesday to narrow gaps on a plan to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to cover Ukraine's economic and military needs over the next two years  ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders later this week.Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine  the leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s needs  which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion). Ukraine is desperate to secure the money by early 2026.“We do not have the luxury of time ” Sweden's EU Affairs Minister Jessica Rosencrantz told reporters in Brussels. “It is really time to move forward with a decision  and Sweden is willing to share the risk because the cost and risk of doing nothing is greater.”Such a move has never been made before  and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries’ money  it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.Belgium  where most of the assets are held  is the main opponent of the plan. It fears that Russia will strike back  either through the courts or in more nefarious ways.European Council President António Costa  who will chair Thursday's summit  has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision  even if it takes days.EU leaders froze the money  most of it in Russian Central Bank assets  over the war that President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the plan as “theft.”Then last Friday  the EU placed an indefinite freeze on the assets — estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion) — to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia  both with Moscow-friendly governments  can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.It also ensures that the assets can't be used by the United States or Russia in any Ukraine peace negotiations without European approval.Two plans for using the money have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.Plan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets  much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic. But many of Europe’s major economies are cash-strapped and mired in debt.The assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($227 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.Plan A has distinct political advantages. Should the EU choose to use the assets  only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all  meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.Over the last year  Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. Avoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027  for a total loan of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.Due to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets  cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. Under the new plan  some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.The commission insists that there is no “theft ” as Russia has claimed  because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.Once Putin paid war reparations  Ukraine would repay the EU  the EU would repay Euroclear  and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank  which in recent days sued the clearing house in an effort to recover its money  ramping up pressure ahead of the summit.Importantly for Belgium  the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so  as Sweden did on Tuesday.But the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission’s reparations loan plan was made public  the government warned of “consequential economic  financial and legal risks ” and said it felt that EU partners were not listening to its concerns.Euroclear has not ruled out legal action of its own  should the EU oblige it to transfer the Russian assets.But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agrees that a reparations loan would be “a game-changer. Why? Because it is a security guarantee for Ukraine — a financial security guarantee.” Ukraine  he said  would be free to use the money on its economy  infrastructure or armed forces  depending on how the war goes.___Susie Blann in Kyiv contributed to this report.,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,negative,0.0,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['crunch EU summit', 'loan plan', 'Envoys', 'gaps', 'Ukraine', 'Thursday', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'EU Affairs Minister Jessica Rosencrantz', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'President António Costa', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'European Council building', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'European Union envoys', 'distinct political advantages', 'next two years', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Belgian financial clearinghouse', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine peace negotiations', 'EU debt instrument', 'other countries’ money', 'massive loan plan', 'European Commission', 'European approval', 'European economies', 'Two plans', 'International partners', 'financial markets', 'total loan', 'AP Photo', 'Omar Havana', 'euro currency', 'member nations', 'main opponent', 'nefarious ways', 'indefinite freeze', 'Moscow-friendly governments', 'United States', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'major economies', 'substantial pot', 'vast majority', 'qualified majority', 'green light', 'last year', 'member countries', 'EU headquarters', 'EU support', 'reparations loan', 'crunch summit', '135 billion euros', '210 billion euros', '193 billion euros', '90 billion euros', 'EU Summit', 'full-scale war', 'Plan B', 'Plan A', 'new plan', 'two-thirds majority', 'EU leaders', 'EU sanctions', 'war reparations', 'military needs', 'cash balances', 'collateral', 'FILE', 'left', 'Brussels', 'Tuesday', 'gaps', 'billions', 'dollars', 'economic', 'Kyiv', 'luxury', 'time', 'Sweden', 'reporters', 'decision', 'risk', 'move', 'Europeans', 'confidence', 'retaliation', 'Belgium', 'courts', 'days', 'February', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'damage', 'bloc', 'September', 'Euroclear', 'Borrowing', 'single', 'vote', 'idea', 'turn', 'heels', 'veto', 'interest']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,abcnews.go.com

U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said Tuesday in Washington that the question of how to monetize those reserves “is a global security issue” that should not be “up to Belgian bankers.”“None of the security details [in the peace proposals] matter if Ukraine is broke by springtime ” said Lucas Guttenberg  a director of the Europe Future program at Bertelsmann Stiftung  a German foundation. “That’s why I am hopeful about Thursday. We need to find the money  and there is no magic wand” otherwise that can provide the massive cash injection that Kyiv needs to meet its financial obligations over the next two fiscal years.Russian overseas reserves have been frozen since the Ukraine war began  but Europe has struggled to find a way to monetize the more than 200 billion euros it holds for Ukraine’s benefit. The bloc has agreed to small-scale loans backed by the interest generated by frozen Russian reserves  but the latest creative plan would have called for a lump-sum loan backed by the entirety of Russia’s frozen assets  payable only after Russia had made good on post-war reparations.There were always some naysayers: Belgium  where the bulk of the frozen money is stored in the Euroclear clearing house  has always been lukewarm on the idea of touching the money  and Hungary and Slovakia have long made it difficult for fellow EU member states to support Ukraine or put the screws to Russia.But in recent days  opponents of the “reparations loan” plan have multiplied. Italy  Bulgaria  Malta  and the Czech Republic have also come out against the idea of seizing  rather than just freezing  Russia’s overseas state assets. Even that opposition is not enough to overcome the new  looser EU rules that ditched unanimous consent for a “qualified majority” of countries to approve measures related to the Russian assets  but Europe is loath to railroad the proposal through.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  a champion of the creative loan idea  warned that Europe would be “severely damaged” if it can’t agree on a way to tap the assets this week. EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas on Monday acknowledged that implementing the plan seems “increasingly difficult.”Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenksy  speaking before the Dutch parliament on Tuesday  urged the Netherlands to support the loan proposal  arguing that “these Russian assets can and must be fully  fully used to defend against Russia’s own aggression. The aggressor must pay.” (The European Union on Tuesday established a commission to address claims for damages to Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion.)The suspicion in Europe is that the newfound skepticism of the loan proposal reflects the desire of right-wing governments to curry favor with the Trump administration  which initially sought to use the frozen Russian assets for the United States’ and Russia’s benefit through for-profit investment vehicles.“This loan is the way to finance Ukraine. The big question is if [Italian premier Giorgia] Meloni passes the test of being more friends with Trump  or is more of a good European ” said Guttenberg.For n0w  Belgium is still playing hard to convince  even after Europe scrambled to provide a suite of guarantees meant to assuage that country’s concern that it could face legal liability for touching the bulk of Russia’s frozen assets. (Russia has already filed some legal actions in that direction.)At any rate  as crucial as the Thursday meeting is for shoring up Ukraine’s future finances  Europe has already taken the most important and most daring step  by freezing the Russian overseas funds indefinitely.By invoking a seldom-used emergency powers clause  Brussels was able last week to permanently freeze the 210 billion euros of Russian Central Bank assets held in a half-dozen member states without relying on the dangerous and cumbersome need to renew the freeze through unanimous consent every six months. That process led to continued ransom threats from Hungary  and fears that the frozen funds would be released prematurely; now Europe has a veto on the ultimate use of those frozen funds.“The decision Europe made last week was much more important. At the end  that money is now in the hands of the Europeans  and before it was subject to review every six months ” said Guttenberg. “All that has completely changed.”The next step will come later this week  as European leaders seek to bridge the remaining differences on how to move from freezing to essentially seizing assets. The stakes  Zelensky said  couldn’t be higher:“It is a security guarantee for Ukraine—a financial security guarantee.”,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.07,0.24,0.69,True,English,"['Frozen Assets', 'Europe', 'Clock', 'Russia', 'EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas', 'U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse', 'new, looser EU rules', 'next two fiscal years', 'Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenksy', 'Italian premier Giorgia] Meloni', 'fellow EU member states', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian Central Bank reserves', 'U.S. security guarantees', 'Russian overseas funds indefin', 'big European Union meeting', 'U.S. envoys', 'The European Union', 'European security force', 'global security issue', 'massive cash injection', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'profit investment vehicles', 'Russian overseas reserves', 'large-scale financial support', 'overseas state assets', 'post-war security guarantees', 'latest creative plan', 'frozen Russian reserves', 'Europe Future program', 'creative loan idea', 'Russian funds', 'security details', 'German foundation', 'good European', 'Russian assets', 'Russian invasion', 'United States', 'post-war army', 'financial obligations', 'post-war reparations', 'big question', 'future finances', 'Thursday meeting', 'frozen assets', 'contentious points', 'moving parts', 'stop efforts', 'immediate loan', '140 billion euros', 'Belgian bankers', 'peace proposals', 'Bertelsmann Stiftung', 'magic wand', '200 billion euros', 'small-scale loans', 'lump-sum loan', 'recent days', 'reparations loan', 'Czech Republic', 'unanimous consent', 'qualified majority', 'Dutch parliament', 'newfound skepticism', 'right-wing governments', 'legal liability', 'legal actions', 'daring step', 'peace plan', 'loan proposal', 'Lucas Guttenberg', 'frozen money', 'Trump administration', 'Ukraine war', 'Negotiators', 'Berlin', 'cease-fire', 'Kremlin', 'eyes', 'bloc', 'logjam', 'way', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Kyiv', 'country', 'questions', 'size', 'composition', 'scope', 'reliability', 'start', 'attention', 'Washington', 'None', 'springtime', 'director', 'benefit', 'interest', 'entirety', 'naysayers', 'Belgium', 'bulk', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'screws', 'opponents', 'Italy', 'Bulgaria', 'Malta', 'opposition', 'countries', 'measures', 'champion', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Netherlands', 'aggression', 'aggressor', 'commission', 'claims', 'damages', 'suspicion', 'desire', 'favor', 'friends', 'n0w', 'suite', 'concern', 'direction', 'rate', 'important']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,foreignpolicy.com

Read full story,"ROME  Dec 16 (Reuters) - Italy's ruling parties are urging caution in the use of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine  according to a draft parliamentary resolution  saying the impact on state finances should be carefully assessed.The European Union wants to tap part of the roughly 210 billion euros ($246.96 billion) worth of Russian central bank assets frozen in Europe after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 to back a loan for Kyiv's military and civilian needs.Some member states including Belgium - where the Euroclear depository holding most of the total assets frozen in Europe is based - have expressed unease at the plan.Russia's central bank has filed a lawsuit seeking damages. It has said EU plans to use its assets are illegal and it reserves the right to deploy all means to protect its interests.RESOLUTION DUE TO FACE VOTE ON WEDNESDAYThe Italian lawmakers' document voices concerns that Rome could be forced to contribute towards damages claimed by Moscow  should any legal action be successful.The Italian document - drafted by the ruling Brothers of Italy  League and Forza Italia parties - calls on the government ""to request the European Commission to conduct a thorough examination of the legal and financial aspects of all the financing options on the table"".The draft  which needs to be finalised  is due to be voted on in parliament on Wednesday after a speech by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ahead of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.The document says Rome ""will pay particular attention to the issue of the current and future impact on public finances"".The country wants to avoid jeopardising its exit from a European infringement procedure for an excessive budget deficit next year.Italy urged its counterparts in Europe to explore alternative options to meet Ukraine's financial needs  including a bridge loan guaranteed by EU funds  according to people familiar with the matter.The coalition's document nonetheless vowed to offer ""multidimensional support"" to Ukraine and said it was important to keep high pressure on Russia to accelerate a peace process.Divisions have emerged among the allies over providing military supplies to Ukraine  with the League party - which had ties with the Kremlin in the past - saying aid to Kyiv may contribute to fuelling corruption there.The resolution says Italy should work with its partners to assess Ukraine's financial assistance needs for 2026–2027 and identify the most legally and financially sound way to meet them  with clear rules governing the use of funds.($1 = 0.8503 euros)(Reporting by Angelo Amante and Giuseppe Fonte; Editing by Alison Williams)",neutral,0.01,0.76,0.23,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'ruling parties', 'Italy', 'caution', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'Russian central bank assets', 'excessive budget deficit', 'The European Union', 'European infringement procedure', 'The Italian lawmakers', 'Forza Italia parties', 'financial assistance needs', 'draft parliamentary resolution', 'Russian assets', 'financial needs', 'European Commission', 'ruling parties', 'civilian needs', 'financial aspects', 'total assets', 'state finances', 'member states', 'Euroclear depository', 'EU plans', 'RESOLUTION DUE', 'ruling Brothers', 'thorough examination', 'financing options', 'EU leaders', 'particular attention', 'public finances', 'alternative options', 'multidimensional support', 'high pressure', 'peace process', 'sound way', 'clear rules', 'Angelo Amante', 'Giuseppe Fonte', 'Alison Williams', 'Italian document', '210 billion euros', 'legal action', 'future impact', 'bridge loan', 'EU funds', 'military supplies', 'League party', '0.8503 euros', 'ROME', 'Reuters', 'Italy', 'caution', 'Ukraine', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'Belgium', 'unease', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'right', 'means', 'interests', 'FACE', 'VOTE', 'WEDNESDAY', 'concerns', 'government', 'table', 'speech', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'issue', 'current', 'country', 'exit', 'counterparts', 'people', 'matter', 'coalition', 'Divisions', 'allies', 'Kremlin', 'past', 'aid', 'corruption', 'partners', 'Editing']",2025-12-16,2025-12-17,thestar.com.my

CMB.TECH has signed an off-take agreement for green ammonia produced by CEEC Hydrogen Energy (“CEEC”) in Jilin Province and will own a minority share in privately owned Jiangsu Andefu Energy Technology Co.  Ltd. (“Andefu”) one of China's largest ammonia supply chain companies.Green ammonia produced in Jilin ProvinceCMB.TECH will purchase green ammonia produced in Jilin Province by the CEEC Songyuan project under an off-take agreement[1]. In the first phase of the CEEC Songyuan project  approximately 158 000 tonnes of renewable ammonia will be produced annually. Construction of the project was completed at the end of September 2025 and commercial operation is planned for January 2026.The project is mainly powered by off-grid renewable energy and supported by batteries and hydrogen buffer storage. CEEC appointed Bureau Veritas for the certification audit  and the project obtained ISCC EU RFNBO certification on 2 December 2025.Andefu  one of China's largest ammonia supply chain companiesCMB.TECH will also acquire a minority stake in Andefu  one of China’s largest ammonia supply chain companies. This will create an industrial partnership between two companies supporting maritime decarbonisation and the development of a green ammonia supply infrastructure.A subsidiary of Andefu  Jiangsu Andefu Storage Co.  Ltd.  is currently constructing a 49 000 m³ low-temperature ammonia storage tank in Nanjing  providing critical hub capacity for ammonia distribution and future marine fuel applications. The storage tank is scheduled to be commissioned in Q1 2026.In addition  Andefu  in cooperation with CEEC  will build an ammonia storage terminal into operation in Panjin in the second half of 2027  significantly enhancing China’s large-scale green ammonia logistics and supply capabilities.Andefu is also advancing ship-to-ship (STS) ammonia bunkering operations  targeting commercial deployment in 2026  to support the emerging global ammonia-fuelled shipping fleet together with CMB.TECH.CMB.TECH's ammonia-powered fleetCMB.TECH will take delivery of 11 ammonia-powered ships next year.

Even if Tsiaras did not go yesterday to M.M.  from the moment the government received the farmers’ demands it decided to prepare a serious basis for dialogue  in order to remove from the roadblocks the argument of an unclear discussion framework. For the first time  therefore  tax-free fuel at the pump entered the equation (wow)  on which Tsiaras has been working behind the scenes for some time with Pitsilis of the AADE. Also  there is discussion with PPC about agricultural electricity  although Stassis has clear reservations regarding his own production cost. And at M.M.  I understand that they say the farmers heard positively the message about changes to the ELGA regulation  so that they are compensated 100% for the damage they suffer—something they have been asking for for years. It is obvious that the government wanted to “break” the KKE line at the roadblocks  which is hard  since the others who are not organized in Perissos have nothing to gain if they do not engage in discussion.The meeting with MitsotakisThe farmers will obviously make their decisions and decide their next steps  and given that the door of Hatzidakis  as well as of Tsiaras  remains open for dialogue. I hear  however  that since yesterday quite a few  especially in the Thessalian plain  are “looking into” the schedule of K.M. I wrote it yesterday  I repeat it today: from Friday midday and through the weekend Mitsotakis will be in Athens  having returned from Brussels and before leaving for Israel  therefore there is a time window. Until last night K.M. was considering whether to make a political reference to the issue during his speech at the closing of the budget debate or something more. I think it will depend on the outcome of the issue and  of course  on how the farmers react.Relieving the MPsThe appearance of Tsiaras and the description of specific interventions that the government can make to address  more long-term and not only in a firefighting manner  the cost of production that is squeezing farmers  also gives an additional argument to ND MPs  who complain that they are “taking a beating” in their constituencies. At the recent parliamentary group meeting they were of course… quiet  but with a view also to their appointment with Mitsotakis on Wednesday afternoon at M.M.  the government wants them to have some footing as well.Will Stefanos shut it down or not?After months I say I’ll write something about that poor Stefanos  since as I understand it  after party operatives inflated his ego that he was about to go to Maximos  they have now left him holding the bag. Something like the old shell-game men. So he came out the other day and pre-announced an extraordinary conference for the “Movement of Democracy” in February  where substantive decisions will be taken about the continuation of its course. Or not—are we closing the shop? The obvious goal remains to get the party into Parliament  but it’s not exactly “taking off” either. Many say that in this move they see a tactical maneuver on his part  so that party members approve the prospect of governmental collaborations after the elections  so the party can play the role of the “wild card.” Kasselakis himself  moreover  the other day left open the possibility even of cooperation with ND  though not with Mitsotakis. I  however  believe that even if Peanut told him to  he would go running  because he got a taste for the grandeur—but well… he isn’t a shipowner either.The Swiss-franc loan regulation goes to Parliament on Thursday 18/12We move to the market  starting with what is most interesting for the public  namely the regulation by the Minister of Economy K. Pierrakakis for Swiss-franc loans. It is a bold regulation that concerns all borrowers with or without criteria and is graduated according to the size of the haircut. The news is that the relevant provisions are being submitted to Parliament the day after tomorrow  Thursday 18/12. As we said  the regulations for Swiss-franc loans concern everyone  people with assets and without. However  the size of the haircut will vary  related to the Swiss-franc–euro exchange rate. For the “well-off ” that is  borrowers without income criteria  the haircut is standard—i.e.  15% below the Swiss-franc–euro exchange rate level—and a fixed interest rate of 2.90%. The first category starts at income of €7 500 and ends at €22 000; the second starts at €9 375 and ends at €25 250. Of course  this large gradation also provides for asset criteria and also counts deposits. Finally  dominant is the picture with regard to the number of household members. For each of the three categories the haircut is 50%  30% or 20%  respectively  and interest rates of 2.30%  2.50% and 2.70%  respectively. The gradation has multiple aims: to offer a fair and sustainable solution for borrowers  linked to their capabilities  which however will not excessively burden the banking system and will ensure zero burden with regard to Hercules.Pavlos Mylonas’s “silent” deal for the silverwareLet’s start the business news with National Bank and P. Mylonas. The entire market has its eyes on him waiting for the bank’s deals in the insurance sector. In the meantime  however  Mylonas made an important deal  with an impact on the balance sheet… but he avoids (wisely) opening his mouth. Specifically  on 8/12 the agreement with Prodea of National Bank and Papalekkas was announced. First of all  although they were announced simultaneously as two separate deals  they are only formally so  because I must tell you that Papalekkas has an excellent relationship with National Bank  which values and particularly trusts him as a businessman  from the moment that when Papalekkas sold in Romania  he showed up on Aiolou with a check with a three-digit number to repay the borrowed funds. With the National Bank–Prodea agreement  100 properties (mainly offices and shops) that were leased by National Bank itself passed under National Bank’s control for a consideration of €510 million (according to information  about half is the value of loans that burdened the properties). These are the “silverware” of the former Pangaea that the Turkollias–Christodoulou management sold in 2013 without a tender to the then Invel of Steinmetz–Papachristophorou for €640 million. Shortly thereafter international warrants began to be issued for Steinmetz  who also withdrew from Invel. Information is that in 2013  to pay part of the €640 million  Invel took a loan from National Bank. Indeed  the then management of National Bank showed such magnanimity that it revised the leases of the properties it used to levels outside the market  so that the servicing of the loan would work. Thus P. Mylonas  with the agreement expected to close by May 2026  significantly reduces National Bank’s operating expenses. The leases with the high rents were expiring in 2028. Therefore  expect from next year that NBG will significantly reduce operating costs with the 100 properties  while other purchases of NBG properties that belonged to Pangaea have also preceded.National Bank and insurance companiesNow  regarding National Bank’s collaborations in the insurance field  if I have understood correctly  they will be announced late January–early February. Everything is agreed and arranged with Piraeus Bank  but there must be certain legal issues with exclusivities that require some time to resolve. National Bank’s cooperation in the life sector is a given with NN in a scheme of common interests. For the non-life sector the picture is not as clear  with Allianz having had a lead  which however is not certain. So patience and we’ll see.H. Megalou on Abu Dhabi and EuroxxIn a meeting he had yesterday with journalists  the CEO of Piraeus Bank  on the occasion of his recent presence at a conference in Abu Dhabi  answering a relevant question said that the bank is examining the possibility of opening offices in Abu Dhabi. Regarding the information recently published about an acquisition by Piraeus Bank of Euroxx  Mr. H. Megalou said that there is nothing  if there is it will be announced  adding that in any case now with the inclusion of the Athens Exchange in Euronext  brokerage schemes need to grow.What they discussed yesterday at the Bank of Greece: servicers ask the authorities for data on 2.5 million citizensKnots in the debt market are being untied as procedures move forward that fall under the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Justice in order to resolve critical issues in the debt management market and allow a larger number of properties to enter the real estate market  from those managed by servicers and banks. The issues were discussed at yesterday’s meeting of the Working Committee under the supervision of the Bank of Greece. According to what the representatives of the servicers  the Ministry of Justice  the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Greece said yesterday  there appears to be progress in reducing the time required to complete registrations in the Cadastre and in digitizations so as ultimately to reduce the time for issuing court decisions. This year  planning authorities are being integrated into the Cadastre  a development that will bring results although it needs some months of “maturation” of procedures. Also  procedures are advancing so that what the Katseli Law (3869) provides can be applied  namely that when a debtor has included debt secured by real estate in the favorable Katseli provisions and at the same time has other properties  these must be liquidated. This provision  although provided for by law  has not been applied to date. Note that the request that servicers have put forward is to obtain contact details of 2 500 000 relationships by using the data held by the Authorities  something that is under relevant processing.An alliance of Mytilineos–Savvidis is gestating for the “new Toumba”The Belterra–METKA agreement for the project of expanding Pier 6 at the Port of Thessaloniki seems to be opening the way for another one as well  that of constructing the “new Toumba.” Market information reports that an announcement is imminent of the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to be founded by Ivan Savvidis  with initial share capital of €10 million. Based on the Memorandum signed by PAOK FC and PAOK AC  the new stadium will be built with financing entirely from the Savvidis side. This means that Ivan will be able to agree himself with any private or public company he chooses. Thus  the appointment of METKA as the construction company becomes very likely  especially given its “experience ” from METKA’s participation in the consortium for the construction of Panathinaikos’s new stadium in Votanikos  together with AKTOR and TERNA.Sweeping changes to the BoD of ATHEX by Euronext – Who staysThe Greek Stock Exchange is gradually entering the Euronext orbit. The countdown for the critical extraordinary general meeting of ATHEX shareholders  which will take place just before Christmas  on December 22  has already begun  and one of the key issues is the change of the Board of Directors. Individuals chosen by Stéphane Boujnah  CEO of Euronext  will enter management  while the new BoD will have 11 members. The re-election of Giannos Kontopoulos as CEO is proposed  and Giorgos Doukidis  Nikolaos Krenteras and Xenia Kazoli are to remain as independent non-executive members. From there on  a number of senior Euronext executives will join the BoD  specifically Manuela Bassi (CEO of Euronext Technologies and Head of Client Connectivity & Colocation Services at Euronext)  Camille Beudin (a member of the Executive Committee and Chief Diversification Officer)  Sebastien d’Herbès (head of the integration of ATHEX into Euronext)  Giorgio Modica (CFO of Euronext) and Emilie Rieupeyroux (head of Market Strategy  Cash Equities & Data Services at Euronext). Beyond that  the plans for Euronext Athens are many and ambitious. Stéphane Boujnah has outlined some of them  specifically the creation of a “corridor” so that Greek shipping companies listed abroad  with a single order book and a single point of entry in Athens  can be listed on the domestic market  as well as plans for the energy sector and the Energy Exchange. Of course  the plans also include the creation of a hub in Athens  something that has already been preannounced. And of course  before all this  the new BoD will have to deal with the “legal arbitrage” being attempted by the Maltese fund Praude Asset Management of Italian lawyer Massimo Malvestio  who wants to sell dearly his 9% stake in ATHEX.There is only one… Natasa – Now also in real estateAmong those forming real estate companies  I single out an already… distinctive presence  the popular folk singer Natasa Theodoridou  who  as I was informed  also proceeded last Friday to the establishment of the company “NT Land Resort Real Estate Exploitation S.A.”  with the name obviously deriving from her initials. The company is headquartered on Mimnermou Street in the Rigillis area  and its purpose includes the purchase and sale of real estate and plots  construction of buildings  hotels and similar accommodations  among others. Its initial capital was set at €1 100 000  divided into 22 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €50 each  and it was fully paid up upon incorporation. These corporate units represent partners’ contributions as follows: Anastasia Theodoridou paid €550 000 in cash and received 11 000 corporate units  with a nominal value of €50 each. The company under the name “Anastasia Theodoridou & Co. EE ” based in Kifisia  paid €440 000 in cash and received 8 800 corporate units  with a nominal value of €50 each. The company under the name “Aeolus NRGBC I.K.E.” paid €110 000 in cash and received 2 200 corporate units  with a nominal value of €50 each. The management of the company and the handling of corporate affairs in general were assumed for an indefinite period by the popular singer herself  who beyond the musical staff clearly aspires to… a gold record in real estate as well.The Derivatives Market “protected” Piraeus Bank shareholdersIt has long been known that as of today  Piraeus Bank shares cease trading on the Stock Exchange in order to complete the corporate transformation involving the absorption of the subsidiary by the parent company. The new shares are scheduled to start trading next Monday  December 22. In view of this interruption  a small game emerged in the Derivatives Market. The Exchange’s management announced that the December Futures Contracts (Futures) of Piraeus Bank will not close next Friday  December 19  as with all other shares and indices  but 10 days later  on Monday  December 29. In addition  ATHEX announced—suddenly—that the margin on the December futures of Piraeus Bank is increased from 14% to 20%. Obviously  ATHEX’s decision was taken in an attempt to protect investors from extreme fluctuations  but in other corresponding cases (e.g. Eurobank) no similar “protection” was announced. The result  however  was a wave of liquidations by those who could not meet the increased requirements of the Derivatives Market.TITAN’s port strategyTen months ago  in February  TITAN sold 75% of Adocim in Eastern Turkey  collecting $87.5 million. A few days ago  TITAN bought Traçim in the Istanbul area  paying $190 million. The big difference lies in the ports. Adocim in Anatolia is located far from ports and serves only the local market. By contrast  Traçim  with capacity of 2.5 million tons annually  is located in Western Turkey near the ports of Marmara and serves not only a densely populated area of Istanbul  but also a significant export portfolio. One month ago  TITAN entered into exclusive negotiations for the acquisition of Vracs de L’Estuaire at the port of Le Havre  in Northern France. In addition to the modern grinding plant with annual capacity of 1.2 million tons  Vracs de L’Estuaire has direct access to the largest port of France with destination Paris and central France  one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in Europe. The strategy is obvious and the market rewards it by raising TITAN’s market capitalization to €3.64 billion (€46.7 per share).Low tones from Piraeus Port Authority on ElefsinaWith interest but without the slightest sign of concern  the new management of Piraeus Port Authority S.A.  under its new chairman Han Chao  appears to be monitoring the government initiatives for upgrading the port of Elefsina. According to information  at the port of Piraeus the view prevails that Elefsina is not coming “head-on ” but can function complementarily  strengthening the Greek port system overall. In the corridors of PPA it is said that the main objective is not internal competition  but strengthening Greece’s role as an international logistics hub. In this context  every investment that improves infrastructure and creates new possibilities in ship repair and cargo handling is considered a positive development for the entire shipping and port “ecosystem.” Particular importance is also attached to the political environment. As well-informed sources note  recently tensions between China and the U.S. regarding Greek ports appear to be easing. This creates a calmer international “corridor ” within which the government can promote investments without the pressures and dilemmas of the past. At PPA they estimate that this balance also facilitates their own strategy: investments in Piraeus  openness to synergies  and at the same time support for a national supply chain that does not rely on a single port. The message being sent  according to the same information  is clear: more and better infrastructure means a bigger pie for everyone.Paschalis Diamantidis picks up the paceThree years after his first move into bulkers  Paschalis Diamantidis is steadily expanding the fleet of Velos Dry with the purchase of another Japanese-built vessel. The 80 700-dwt Key Frontier (built 2011)  a kamsarmax  is changing hands from Nippo Shipping for nearly $18.5 million  with delivery scheduled for February–March 2026. This is the second acquisition of Velos Dry in 2025  following the summer deal for the 95 600-dwt post-panamax Azalea Wave (built 2013) from Santoku Senpaku at $17 million. The direction is clear: Velos Dry is investing in Japanese-controlled second-hand tonnage  with vessels built between 2011–2015 and with a preference for panamaxes  kamsarmaxes and post-panamaxes. The company’s fleet now reaches six bulkers  half of which are kamsarmaxes. Diamantidis’ choice is not random: Velos Dry moves with steady  gradual and selective steps  avoiding intense  short-term sale-and-purchase market activity. This strategy is proving correct  especially as kamsarmaxes have recently shown more restrained performance compared to the larger capesizes  a fact also reflected in the limited number of second-hand transactions in recent weeks.When G.P. doesn’t waste timeDynagas LNG Partners  the New York–listed company of George Prokopiou (G.P.)  does not waste time. After the completion of a previous buyback in which only $2.18 million of shares were purchased  it is launching a new $10 million share repurchase program  showing that its strategy is not only steady but also hands-on. Purchases will be made periodically  either on the open market or through privately negotiated deals  keeping the company flexible and the balance sheet lean. With six vessels on multi-year charters and total carrying capacity of 914 000 cbm  Dynagas maintains stable cash flow  while quarterly net profits amounted to $18.7 million  up from $15.1 million last year. This move comes at a time when other Greek- and Cypriot-interest listed companies  such as Safe Bulkers of Polys Vassos Hatzioannou and OceanPal of Semiramis Paliou  are running large share buyback programs totaling $62 million  sending the message that Greek shipowners know how to return capital to shareholders.Waiting for the markets’ Santa ClausThe first 15 days of December are being recorded as the best two weeks of the last 75 years for Wall Street. While institutional investors are selling to lock in profits (and their annual bonuses)  retail investors—who account for 20% of the average daily trading value in the U.S. market—continue to buy  having placed their expectations on the famous and statistically confirmed “Santa Claus Rally.” History and statistics confirm that from as far back as 1929 until today  the S&P 500 index has recorded gains in 79% of cases during this specific holiday period  with an average return of +1.6%. Usually  the Santa Claus Rally refers to the last 5 sessions of December and the first 2 of January. Since 1950  the positive return has been repeated with the same frequency (79%) and with an average gain of +1.3%. Over the last 8 years  the index declined only once during this period. Today in the U.S. market  retail investors carry out 75% of their trades via mobile phones. A +47% increase is already recorded in the downloading of trading apps. It is also striking that 41% of Gen Z and Millennial investors listen carefully to the advice of digital Artificial Intelligence trading advisors.Germans pay dearly for their loansThe ten-year German bond today “pays” 2.86%. Inflation in Germany is below 1.8%. Conclusion: investor-savers who buy German bonds are not worried about inflation  but have doubts about the ability to repay the debt and therefore demand a risk premium of around 1.7%. Germany’s public debt this year has reached 63.5% of GDP  next year it is estimated at 65.2% of GDP  and in 2027 at 67% of GDP. State spending on defense  energy and new social programs is putting pressure on the budget  while the famous “golden rule” of debt has been loosened. The constitutional reform of March 2025 excludes from the “golden rule” all defense spending above 1% of GDP. A Special Infrastructure Fund of €500 billion is being created for the necessary infrastructure investments  while the government announced new tax relief for businesses and households. In addition to all this  demographics geometrically increase social spending. The fiscal deficit this year will exceed 3% and next year will rise to 4% of GDP. All this—of course—is neither dramatic nor does it foreshadow disaster. The once “safe investment haven” of Europe that served as the basis for measuring investment risk has today become more expensive.An ounce of silver is worth as much as a barrel of oilThree years ago  oil was five times more expensive than the despised silver. Today  one ounce of silver ($63.80) is worth more than a barrel of WTI crude oil ($57.30). The year 2025 will be recorded as the worst year for oil (-20%) since the pandemic crisis. For silver  2025 will be the best year since 1979 (+115%). The new “green” economy requires abundant silver (photovoltaics  electric vehicles  5G  and AI data centers)  while production cannot meet increased demand for a third consecutive year. OPEC+ countries cannot  or perhaps do not want to  coordinate. Countries that produce silver (Mexico  Peru  China) acquire increased geostrategic importance. For more than 150 years  the global economy carefully and with awe studied international oil prices.
