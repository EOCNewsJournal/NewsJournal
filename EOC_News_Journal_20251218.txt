Fitch said it may downgrade the bank if the European Commission’s plan goes ahead without strong legal and liquidity safeguards.Euroclear was tasked with holding bonds for Russia’s central bank; they have matured into cash but cannot be returned because of EU sanctions. The money is currently parked in short-term deposits at the European Central Bank.Under the EU plan  Euroclear would invest the funds in European Commission bonds to help finance a so-called “reparations loan” to Ukraine  to be repaid only if Kiev later receives reparations from Russia.Fitch warned that Euroclear could face problems if Russia’s central bank were suddenly allowed to reclaim the funds  as the bank might have to pay out quickly while the assets remain locked up  creating a timing mismatch on its balance sheet.Kirill Dmitriev  the Russian president’s adviser on international investment matters  warned that a downgrade of Euroclear could prompt investors to move funds elsewhere. “The European Commission loves self-mutilation ” he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.Euroclear and the Belgian government have been among the strongest opponents of the “reparations loan” proposal  warning that it could threaten the institution’s financial stability. Senior financial figures  including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde  have also cautioned that proceeding with the process could damage the credibility of the EU’s financial system.Last week  the Bank of Russia filed a lawsuit against Euroclear at the Moscow Arbitration Court seeking damages over the immobilization of its funds.

This could lead to a downgrade of Euroclear's rating. Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the EU and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $350 billion.

The EU Commission has been seeking approval from EU member states to use frozen Russian assets to finance Kiev's war efforts.

European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has proposed using the funds to back a so-called ‘reparations loan’ to Ukraine.Budapest had respected the EU’s principle of “loyal cooperation” on frozen Russian assets  but the bloc “responded by stripping Hungary of its rights ” Orban said on X on Wednesday.“From this point on  I don’t consider the principle of loyal cooperation to be binding on Hungary either  if the other party has renounced it ” he said.According to the Hungarian leader  bloc leaders have breached EU law by proposing to settle the issue of Russian assets not by consensus  but by a qualified majority vote.Orban called it a “dangerous precedent” and said the move could sow distrust among other EU members if their interests were similarly ignored.He has previously accused EU officials of “raping European law in broad daylight” by invoking the clause to sidestep Hungary’s potential veto  and said Budapest would take the matter to the bloc’s top court.Legal experts say the clause was designed for economic emergencies within the EU  not to finance wars or seize foreign assets.Last week  Russia’s central bank filed a lawsuit against the Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear  which is holding more than $200 billion in frozen assets.The EU claims the freeze is in line with international law  but Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever warned that that using the money to back a loan to Kiev would undermine trust in the EU financial system and expose Belgium to legal risks.International financial institutions  including the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund  have also cautioned that borrowing against the immobilized assets could erode confidence in the euro.Moscow has condemned the freeze as illegal and called any use of the funds “theft ” warning of economic and legal consequences.,negative,0.0,0.37,0.63,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Hungary', 'EU', 'Orban', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian central bank assets', 'International financial institutions', 'International Monetary Fund', 'European Central Bank', 'frozen Russian assets', 'emergency treaty clause', 'EU financial system', 'qualified majority vote', 'other EU members', 'Belgian clearinghouse', 'frozen assets', 'other party', 'foreign assets', 'international law', 'European Commission', 'European law', 'loyal” obligation', 'member states', 'loyal cooperation', 'Hungarian leader', 'broad daylight', 'potential veto', 'top court', 'Legal experts', 'legal risks', 'legal consequences', 'EU officials', 'veto rights', 'reparations loan', 'economic emergencies', 'EU law', 'bloc leaders', 'issue', 'Hungary', 'Brussels', 'Budapest', 'Article 122', 'approval', 'unanimity', 'objections', 'Slovakia', 'head', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'principle', 'Wednesday', 'point', 'consensus', 'move', 'distrust', 'interests', 'matter', 'wars', 'lawsuit', 'Euroclear', 'freeze', 'line', 'money', 'Kiev', 'Belgium', 'confidence', 'Moscow']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,rt.com

China has consistently called for a diplomatic resolution to the Ukraine conflict.“If the existential threat is there  and China is the main enabler for Russia to wage the war  then first of all  we need to deal with that. And this is a very clear message ” Tsahkna said  linking his remarks to a broader EU push for tougher measures against Russia.Last week  EU member states voted to keep Russian sovereign funds temporarily frozen. The bloc’s leadership invoked emergency powers to bypass opposition from some member states  including Hungary and Slovakia  with debates ongoing over how to further bend legal frameworks to funnel the funds to Ukraine under the so-called “reparations loan” scheme.“Everybody’s talking about the frozen Russian assets  which actually we have. We own them  as we have frozen them ” Tsahkna claimed  insisting that the EU must make a decisive move and use this leverage to force its way back into the US-backed negotiations over Ukraine’s future.Critics within the EU warn that the plan to seize Russian assets carries serious legal and financial risks. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has described the scheme as unlawful and tantamount to a “declaration of war.” Belgium  where most of the funds are held via the Euroclear depository  has also raised concerns about potential legal exposure.Russian officials have repeatedly condemned the freezing and any proposed use of sovereign assets as illegal under international law.

54333,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/17/europe-summit-ukraine/,EU leaders prepare to take unprecedented steps to help Ukraine at a high-stakes summit,The proposal involves using the frozen assets for a 90 billion-euro or $105 billion reparations loan.,By LORNE COOKBRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders are about to attempt something they’ve never tried before. The chances of failure are significant. Their actions this week could set dangerous precedents and a wrong move could undermine trust among the bloc’s 27 member countries for years to come.At a summit starting on Thursday  many of the leaders will press for tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to be used to meet Ukraine’s economic and military needs for the next two years.Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will require a total of 137 billion euros ($160 billion) in 2026 and 2027. It must get the money by spring. The EU has pledged to come up with the funds  one way or another.“One thing is very  very clear ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers on Wednesday. “We have to take the decision to fund Ukraine for the next two years in this European Council.”European Council President António Costa  who will chair the summit  has vowed to keep the leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.High-risk loanThe European Commission has proposed that the leaders use some of the frozen assets — totaling 210 billion euros ($246 billion) — to underwrite a 90 billion-euro ($105 billion) “reparations loan” to Ukraine. The U.K.  Canada and Norway would fill the gap.The plan is contentious. The European Commission insists that its reasoning and legal basis are sound. But the European Central Bank has warned that international trust in the euro single currency could be damaged  if the leaders are suspected of seizing the assets.Most of the frozen assets belong to the Russian Central Bank and are held in the financial clearing house Euroclear  which is based in Brussels. Belgium fears Russian reprisals  through the courts or in other more nefarious ways.Euroclear fears for its reputation. It believes the commission’s idea is legally shaky and that international investors might look elsewhere  if it transfers the Russian assets to an EU debt instrument  as von der Leyen’s plan demands.Last week  the Russian Central Bank announced that it’s suing Euroclear in a Moscow court. The chances that the case will succeed appear limited  but the move does increase pressure on all parties before the summit.Unlikely plan BThe commission  the EU’s powerful executive branch  has proposed a second option. It could try to raise the money on international markets  much in the way it underwrote a major economic recovery fund after the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Belgium prefers this option. But plan B would require all 27 leaders to agree for it to work  and Hungary refuses to fund Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sees himself as a peacemaker. He’s also Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe.In contrast  plan A — the reparations loan — only requires a majority of around two-thirds of member countries to pass. Hungary can’t veto it alone. Slovakia might say no. Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy and Malta remain to be convinced.Even if all six countries reject the loan to Ukraine — which would only be refunded if Russia ends its war and pays hundreds of billions of euros in war damages  something many Europeans doubt Putin would do — they still wouldn’t have a blocking minority.Running a steamroller over Belgium  which has a great stake in the outcome and deep concerns about the loan  could undermine the entire European project  making it infinitely more difficult to find voting majorities on other issues in the future.But on the eve of the summit  it remained unclear precisely how the plan would work  what kind of guarantees each country would give to reassure Belgium it doesn’t face Russia alone  and even whether the leaders can actually approve it outright this week.“It’s a really new approach. Everyone has questions ” according to a senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations  which continued on Wednesday. “You’re talking about mobilizing public finances. Parliaments might need to weigh in.

Source: YouTubeThe company received a rare “no-action” letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday that greenlit a securities tokenization service “on pre-approved blockchains for three years ” and confirmed that the agency won’t take enforcement action against DTCC if its product operates as described.More securities to be tokenizedThe trio is working to launch a minimum viable product in a controlled environment by the first half of 2026  and the DTCC stated that it will “increase the size and scope of the project in the months that follow based upon client interest.”It added that the whole partnership roadmap between the three companies would “unfold over multiple years ” but for now it aims to provide access to “digitized financial instruments in a secure and regulated environment.”DTCC’s managing director of clearing and securities services  Michael Winnike  told Cointelegraph that the SEC’s letter allows it to tokenize “a defined set of highly liquid assets ” including the Russell 1000 and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking major indexes  as well as US Treasurys.“Following the tokenization of US Treasurys on the Canton network  DTC anticipates that such ETFs and equities will come shortly thereafter ” he added.Winnike said that client demand drove it to tokenize US Treasurys and would be “a stepping stone for our clients for integrating their existing infrastructure and processes with new onchain capabilities.”The company added that it would also join the Canton Network’s governance and would take up the position of co-chair alongside Euroclear on the blockchain’s backing organization  the Canton Foundation.Winnike said DTCC would “help set industry-wide standards for decentralized financial infrastructure” and work on interoperability standards for Canton and other blockchain networks.Markets are moving onchain  but analyst expects a slow burnSEC chair Paul Atkins said on Friday after his agency gave DTCC a no-action letter that the company’s initiative “marks an important step towards onchain capital markets.”Related: US Treasurys lead tokenization wave as CoinShares predicts 2026 growth“US financial markets are poised to move onchain ” he said  adding the SEC “is prioritizing innovation and embracing new technologies to enable this onchain future.”The same day  NYDIG global head of research Greg Cipolaro said that the tokenization of securities won’t immediately be a major boon to the crypto market  but that could change if tokenized assets are allowed to better integrate on blockchains.Cipolaro said that traditional finance structures are still required on tokenized assets; their designs can “differ greatly ” and most are hosted on permissionless blockchains like Canton  meaning not all can work with the wider decentralized financial system.“In the future  one could see these RWAs being part of DeFi (composability)  either as collateral for borrowing  an asset to be lent out  or for trading ” he added. “This will take time as technology develops  infrastructure is built out  and rules and regulations evolve.”Magazine: Will Robinhood’s tokenized stocks REALLY take over the world?

(AP Photo/Omar Havana  File)BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders are about to attempt something they’ve never tried before. The chances of failure are significant. Their actions this week could set dangerous precedents and a wrong move could undermine trust among the bloc's 27 member countries for years to come.At a summit starting on Thursday  many of the leaders will press for tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to be used to meet Ukraine’s economic and military needs for the next two years.Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will require a total of 137 billion euros ($160 billion) in 2026 and 2027. It must get the money by spring. The EU has pledged to come up with the funds  one way or another.“One thing is very  very clear "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers on Wednesday. ""We have to take the decision to fund Ukraine for the next two years in this European Council.”European Council President António Costa  who will chair the summit  has vowed to keep the leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.The European Commission has proposed that the leaders use some of the frozen assets — totaling 210 billion euros ($246 billion) — to underwrite a 90 billion-euro ($105 billion) “reparations loan” to Ukraine. The U.K.  Canada and Norway would fill the gap.The plan is contentious. The European Commission insists that its reasoning and legal basis are sound. But the European Central Bank has warned that international trust in the euro single currency could be damaged  if the leaders are suspected of seizing the assets.Most of the frozen assets belong to the Russian Central Bank and are held in the financial clearing house Euroclear  which is based in Brussels. Belgium fears Russian reprisals  through the courts or in other more nefarious ways.Euroclear fears for its reputation. It believes the commission’s idea is legally shaky and that international investors might look elsewhere  if it transfers the Russian assets to an EU debt instrument  as von der Leyen's plan demands.Last week  the Russian Central Bank announced that it's suing Euroclear in a Moscow court. The chances that the case will succeed appear limited  but the move does increase pressure on all parties before the summit.The commission  the EU’s powerful executive branch  has proposed a second option. It could try to raise the money on international markets  much in the way it underwrote a major economic recovery fund after the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Belgium prefers this option. But plan B would require all 27 leaders to agree for it to work  and Hungary refuses to fund Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sees himself as a peacemaker. He's also Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe.In contrast  plan A — the reparations loan — only requires a majority of around two-thirds of member countries to pass. Hungary can't veto it alone. Slovakia might say no. Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy and Malta remain to be convinced.Even if all six countries reject the loan to Ukraine — which would only be refunded if Russia ends its war and pays hundreds of billions of euros in war damages  something many Europeans doubt Putin would do — they still wouldn't have a blocking minority.Running a steamroller over Belgium  which has a great stake in the outcome and deep concerns about the loan  could undermine the entire European project  making it infinitely more difficult to find voting majorities on other issues in the future.But on the eve of the summit  it remained unclear precisely how the plan would work  what kind of guarantees each country would give to reassure Belgium it doesn't face Russia alone  and even whether the leaders can actually approve it outright this week.“It’s a really new approach. Everyone has questions ” according to a senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations  which continued on Wednesday. “You’re talking about mobilizing public finances. Parliaments might need to weigh in.

The weapon of choice is neither artillery nor drones  but sovereign debt and international banking law. At the cente…,As the war in Ukraine grinds toward its fourth winter  a parallel conflict is being fought not in the trenches of the Donbas  but in Brussels. The weapon of choice is neither artillery nor drones  but sovereign debt and international banking law. At the center of this financial storm lies a cache of wealth: nearly €200 billion in Russian Central Bank assets  immobilized since the onset of the full-scale invasion in 2022.The European Union has moved beyond merely freezing these funds. In a landmark and legally perilous shift  the bloc has begun to actively utilize the profits generated by this capital to fund Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction. This strategy  however  has exposed deep fissures within the EU and placed a singular  private Belgian company  Euroclear  in the geopolitical crosshairs.The vault: Euroclear and the mechanics of immobilizationTo understand the scale of the situation  one must understand the custodian holding the keys. Euroclear is not a bank in the traditional consumer sense; it is a Central Securities Depository (CSD)  a critical piece of the “plumbing” that underpins the global financial system. Headquartered in Brussels  Belgium  and employing approximately 6 000 people  Euroclear settles securities transactions for stock exchanges and major financial institutions  ensuring that when a bond or share is traded  the ownership transfers and the cash is delivered.A consortium of major international financial players owns Euroclear. Its shareholder registry includes Caisse de Dépôts (a French public-sector financial institution)  GIC (the sovereign-wealth fund of Singapore)  Euronext (the pan-European stock exchange) and Sicovam  the French central securities custodian (now integrated into the group structure but historically a key stakeholder).The sheer volume of assets flowing through Euroclear is difficult to visualize. At the end of the third quarter (Q3) of 2025  Euroclear held a staggering €42.5 trillion in custodial assets. Much of this sum is held on behalf of clients — pension funds  central banks and commercial banks — and does not sit on Euroclear’s own balance sheet.However  income generated by Russian-owned securities does end up on Euroclear’s books. As of the latest financial disclosures  Euroclear Bank’s own balance sheet stood at €229 billion. Of this amount  a massive €194 billion — nearly 85% — is classified as “related to sanctioned Russian assets.” These are primarily maturing bonds and coupon payments belonging to the Central Bank of Russia that sanctions have blocked. Unable to be transferred back to Moscow  this cash piles up in Belgium  requiring reinvestment.The “windfall”: turning cash into weaponsIn the first half (H1) of 2025 alone  these immobilized Russian assets generated €2.7 billion in interest income. Under normal circumstances  this profit would belong to the client (Russia). However  the EU argues that these “windfall profits” are not sovereign assets but rather a byproduct of the sanctions regime itself.Following legislation passed in May 2024  the EU formalized a mechanism to seize these profits. Of the €2.7 billion earned in H1 2025  €1.8 billion was declared a “windfall contribution.” After Belgian corporate taxes and management fees were deducted  a net total of €1.6 billion was paid out to the EU Commission.The money is transferred to the Ukraine Facility and the European Peace Facility (EPF)  where it is used to directly reimburse EU member states for weapons shipments to Kyiv and to fund the purchase of new ammunition and air defense systems. In effect  the EU has successfully engineered a system where Russia’s own sovereign wealth is partially financing the war effort against it.The Belgian resistance: fear of the “Euroclear run”While the EU Commission in Brussels pushes for aggressive use of these funds  the Belgian government  located just a few miles away  has urged extreme caution. Belgium finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being the sole guardian of the vast majority of Russia’s frozen wealth.Belgium’s resistance is not rooted in sympathy for Moscow  but in fear for the stability of its financial sector and the Euro itself. The Belgian government  along with Euroclear’s management  strongly opposes the full confiscation of the principal assets (the €194 billion itself)  as opposed to just the interest profits.The primary concern is legal precedent and “capital flight.” If the EU were to seize the principal assets  it would cross a Rubicon in international law  effectively declaring that sovereign property is no longer immune. Belgium fears this would send a shockwave through the Global South. Large international asset owners — such as Saudi Arabia  China  Brazil or Indonesia — might look at the precedent and decide that the Eurozone is no longer a safe haven for their reserves.If these nations were to move their securities custody from Euroclear (EU) to competitors in Dubai  Hong Kong or a potential future BRICS-created depository  it could trigger a “run” on Euroclear. Given that Euroclear holds €42.5 trillion in assets  even a partial exodus would be catastrophic for European capital markets.Furthermore  Belgium fears it would be left holding the bag for the inevitable legal retaliation. Russia has already filed dozens of lawsuits in Russian courts against Euroclear  seizing the entity’s meager assets within Russia. Belgium worries that if the principal is confiscated  it will face decades of litigation and potential liability for billions of euros  potentially bankrupting the custodian without an explicit backstop from the rest of the EU.The legal hammer: triggering Article 122Recognizing that unanimity on Russia policy is becoming impossible due to resistance from member states like Hungary and Slovakia  the EU Commission has resorted to a powerful and controversial legal tool: Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).Traditionally designed for economic emergencies (such as the energy crisis or natural disasters)  Article 122 allows the Council to adopt measures by a qualified majority  bypassing the need for unanimous consent.This month  the EU triggered Article 122 to fundamentally alter the sanctions regime. Previously  sanctions on Russian assets had to be renewed every six months by a unanimous vote. This gave leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary a biannual opportunity to hold the bloc hostage  threatening to veto the renewal unless concessions were made elsewhere.By invoking Article 122  the EU has moved to freeze the assets indefinitely until Russia ends the war and compensates Ukraine. This move serves two purposes:Political Insulation: It removes the assets from the six-month veto cycle  locking them down regardless of shifting political winds in Budapest or Bratislava. Collateralization: It provides the legal certainty needed to use the assets as collateral for larger loans. If the assets are guaranteed to remain frozen for years  G7 nations can issue “Reparations Loans” to Ukraine  to be repaid by the future income streams (or the eventual confiscation) of the Russian funds.The implication of using Article 122 is profound. It signals a shift in the EU toward a more federalized  majority-rule foreign policy  much to the chagrin of smaller  neutrality-inclined states.The geopolitical fallout: BRICS+ and the EuroThe aggressive utilization of these assets has not gone unnoticed in Beijing  Riyadh or Brasília. For the BRICS+ nations  the “weaponization of finance” confirms their long-held suspicions about the Western-led order.The immediate impact has been a “quiet diversification.” While a wholesale dumping of the Euro has not occurred — simply because there are few liquid alternatives to the Dollar and Euro — trust in the EU as a neutral arbiter of capital has eroded. Central banks in the Global South are increasingly repatriating gold reserves and exploring non-Euro settlement mechanisms for trade.The danger for the Euro is slow but existential. If the perception solidifies that Euro-denominated assets are subject to political seizure  the Euro’s status as an alternative reserve currency could diminish over the next decade. This would raise borrowing costs for all European governments  as demand for European debt softens. Belgium’s resistance is essentially a warning: Do not sacrifice our long-term financial credibility for a short-term cash injection for Ukraine.Alternative legal avenuesCritics of the EU’s approach argue that there were other  perhaps more legitimate  paths to making Russia pay.International Reparations Mechanism: The standard path would be a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) mandating reparations. However  Russia does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction in this matter  and enforcement would still require the seizure of assets  bringing the EU back to the same legal hurdle. The Countermeasures Doctrine: Legal scholars have argued that under international law  states can take “countermeasures” against an aggressor to induce compliance. This theory posits that seizing assets is a lawful countermeasure to Russia’s illegal invasion. The US has largely backed this interpretation  but European legal scholars (and the Belgian government) remain skeptical  viewing it as a slippery slope that blurs the line between executive action and judicial process.The Trump factor: pressure from across the AtlanticHovering over this entire debate is the shadow of the White House. With Donald Trump in office in late 2025  the dynamic has shifted dramatically. The Trump administration has made it clear that American taxpayers should no longer foot the primary bill for a war in Europe’s backyard.Pressure from Washington has been intense. The US has pushed the EU to stop “dithering” with interest payments and seize the full €194 billion principal to fund the war effort  thereby allowing the US to reduce its own financial aid. Trump’s “Peace through Strength” rhetoric implies that if Europe wants Ukraine to survive  Europe must pay for it  using Russian President Vladimir Putin’s money.This pressure partially explains the EU’s rush to trigger Article 122 and lock in the loan mechanisms this month. European leaders fear that if they do not present a self-sustaining funding model for Ukraine soon  the Trump administration might cut aid entirely or force a peace deal on terms unfavorable to Kyiv. The mobilization of Euroclear’s assets is  in many ways  Europe’s attempt to “Trump-proof” the defense of Ukraine.The €194 billion questionThe situation at Euroclear represents a defining moment for the intersection of law  finance and war. The EU has managed to uncork a stream of billions to aid Ukraine  paying for weapons with the aggressor’s own accrued interest. Yet  in doing so  it has ventured into uncharted legal territory  risking the reputation of its financial system and bypassing its own democratic unanimity rules.For now  the €1.6 billion transferred to Ukraine is a lifeline. But as the war drags on and reconstruction costs mount into the hundreds of billions  the temptation to seize the full €194 billion sitting in Brussels will only grow. Belgium stands as the final gatekeeper  holding the line against a move that could redefine the concept of sovereign property forever. Whether that line holds against the combined pressure of a desperate Kyiv  a federalizing Brussels and an isolationist Washington remains the €194 billion question.[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.,neutral,0.0,0.85,0.14,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['The Battle', 'Frozen Billions', 'Euroclear', 'Russia', 'Caisse de Dépôts', 'potential future BRICS-created depository', 'Large international asset owners', 'French public-sector financial institution', 'singular, private Belgian company', 'major international financial players', 'French central securities custodian', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'major financial institutions', 'Central Securities Depository', 'The European Union', 'traditional consumer sense', 'latest financial disclosures', 'Belgian corporate taxes', 'international banking law', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'European Peace Facility', 'air defense systems', 'The Belgian resistance', 'global financial system', 'EU member states', 'international law', 'financial storm', 'central banks', 'financial sector', 'Belgian government', 'Russian assets', 'securities transactions', 'Russian-owned securities', 'securities custody', 'stock exchanges', 'Global South', 'custodial assets', 'sovereign assets', 'principal assets', 'fourth winter', 'parallel conflict', 'sovereign debt', 'full-scale invasion', 'perilous shift', 'deep fissures', 'geopolitical crosshairs', 'critical piece', 'ownership transfers', 'shareholder registry', 'sovereign-wealth fund', 'group structure', 'key stakeholder', 'sheer volume', 'third quarter', 'commercial banks', 'balance sheet', 'maturing bonds', 'coupon payments', 'first half', 'normal circumstances', 'net total', 'new ammunition', 'aggressive use', 'extreme caution', 'uncomfortable position', 'sole guardian', 'vast majority', 'full confiscation', 'primary concern', 'sovereign property', 'Saudi Arabia', 'safe haven', 'Hong Kong', 'Ukraine Facility', 'windfall contribution', 'sovereign wealth', 'frozen wealth', 'interest income', 'sanctions regime', 'management fees', 'weapons shipments', 'war effort', 'interest profits', 'legal precedent', 'capital flight', 'EU Commission', 'Euroclear Bank', 'pension funds', 'windfall profits', 'Euroclear run', 'trenches', 'Donbas', 'Brussels', 'choice', 'artillery', 'drones', 'center', 'cache', 'onset', 'landmark', 'bloc', 'reconstruction', 'strategy', 'vault', 'mechanics', 'immobilization', 'situation', 'keys', 'CSD', 'plumbing', 'Belgium', '6,000 people', 'cash', 'consortium', 'GIC', 'Singapore', 'Euronext', 'Sicovam', 'end', 'staggering', 'behalf', 'clients', 'books', 'amount', 'massive €194', 'Moscow', 'reinvestment', 'byproduct', 'legislation', 'May', 'mechanism', 'H1', 'money', 'EPF', 'Kyiv', 'purchase', 'effect', 'fear', 'sympathy', 'stability', 'Rubicon', 'shockwave', 'China', 'Brazil', 'Indonesia', 'Eurozone', 'reserves', 'nations', 'competitors', 'Dubai']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,fairobserver.com

Here's an overview of the key questions about the issue.What are frozen assets? Who freezes them?Frozen assets are financial funds or property that the owner cannot access or use for any transaction or transfer because of restrictions imposed by a government — or bloc such as the European Union.In Russia's case  sovereign assets — in the form of cash  bonds and securities held abroad — as well as private assets such as yachts and real estate owned by sanctioned Russian billionaires were frozen.Assets are usually frozen via sanctions.""The implementation of the freezes lies with financial institutions "" such as commercial banks or central securities depositories (CSDs) which must block transactions and cut off access to frozen assets  Agathe Demarais  senior fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations (ECFR)  told DW.Why were Russian assets frozen?Russia's assets were frozen as a result of sanctions after the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. The move was intended to constrain Russia financially and ensure it couldn't use that money to fund the war.Some experts say the presence of the largest chunk of frozen Russian assets in EU member states offers the bloc key leverage in driving the peace talks in Ukraine's favor.Why Russia's frozen assets are a 'trump card' for Europe To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoWhere are Russian assets?Out of a total of around €300 billion in frozen assets  around €210 billion worth of assets are held under EU Member States' jurisdictions.The rest are scattered across the US  Japan  the UK  Switzerland  and Canada.But the largest chunk  €180 billion  is at an institution called Euroclear in Belgium.What is Euroclear  and why is it against the EU using Russia's assets?Euroclear is a major financial-market infrastructure firm  called a securities depository.Euroclear is worried that seizing Russian money will damage its reputation among international investors and could even trigger litigation by Moscow. Russia's central bank has already decided to sue Euroclear for €230 billion — to recover both the frozen money and interest lost.Which countries want to use Russia's assets  and for what?Most European countries including Germany and France want Russia to pay for the damages it has caused by inflicting a war of aggression on Ukraine.The frozen assets could therefore be used to both strengthen Ukraine's defenses and rebuild the country.Which countries do not want to use Russia's assets  and why not?From a legal perspective  using Russian frozen assets is a tricky area and there has been an extensive debate over whether these assets  particularly the principal amount  can legally be used to help Ukraine.Belgium has vetoed the use of the frozen assets due to fears it may get into legal trouble with Moscow. It is also worried about being on the hook to pay back the amount at a later date if Moscow asks.In addition  European heavyweight Italy  as well as Malta and Bulgaria  have asked the EU to look for alternative ways to fund Ukraine's needs.Merz: Frozen Russian assets should be used to support Kyiv To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoWhat is happening to the frozen assets in the interim?They remain frozen or as the EU says  immobilised. That means that any transaction  or transfer back to Russia is blocked.Last year  the EU decided to use windfall profits earned on the assets in Euroclear and paid the first tranche of €1.5 billion to Ukraine mid 2024.Where does the US stand on the use of Russia's assets?Under President Joe Biden  the US — which holds less than €5 billion of Russian assets — agreed to the use of windfall profits to aid Ukraine. The current Trump administration wants to use a part of the frozen Russian assets toward joint projects with Moscow.Experts however say the US can only decide what to do with assets lying in its own jurisdiction and not with those in EU countries.What does Trump's peace plan say about the frozen assets?According to the leaked version of Trump's initial 28-point peace proposal  €86 billion ($100 billion) in frozen Russian assets would be invested in ""US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine"" and the US would receive 50% of the profits. According to Demarais of the ECFR  Trump intends to take that money out of Russian assets frozen in Europe and use that to profit both the US government and US companies.The rest of the frozen funds  still more than €200 billion  would be invested in a joint US-Russian investment vehicle  ""to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict "" according to the proposal. For Demarais  however  this would merely benefit Washington and Moscow  but not Ukraine.European leaders have said that only EU member states can decide what to do with Russian assets lying in their countries Image: Daniel Torok/White House/ZUMA/picture allianceWhy has the EU 'indefinitely immobilized' Russian assets?Originally  the freeze on Russian assets was renewed every six months. And each time it was up for renewal  there was the fear that Hungary's Russia-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban could veto the renewal.The EU's decision to ""Indefinitely immobilize"" Russian assets achieves two goals: It prevents the need for renewal and hence Hungary's potential veto  but also guards the funds from the US.""In essence  it puts the assets out of reach of the US  complicating Trump's plans to transfer the assets to American firms or to a US-Russian investment fund "" Demarais explained. ""The move also paves the way for the EU to issue a loan to Ukraine.""Edited by: Andreas Illmer",neutral,0.0,0.84,0.16,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'Russia', 'everything', 'DW', 'major financial-market infrastructure firm', 'joint US-Russian investment vehicle', 'initial 28-point peace proposal', 'President Joe Biden', 'European heavyweight Italy', 'Most EU members', 'EU member states', 'current Trump administration', 'central securities depositories', 'bloc key leverage', 'Most European countries', 'Frozen Russian assets', 'joint projects', 'peace talks', 'peace plan', 'key questions', 'central bank', 'European Union', 'European Council', 'European leaders', 'Russian billionaires', 'real estate', 'financial institutions', 'commercial banks', 'senior fellow', 'Foreign Relations', 'largest chunk', 'web browser', '€210 billion worth', 'securities depository', 'international investors', 'legal perspective', 'tricky area', 'extensive debate', 'legal trouble', 'later date', 'alternative ways', 'first tranche', 'US-led efforts', 'strong incentive', 'Daniel Torok', 'White House', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign assets', 'private assets', 'frozen money', 'windfall profits', 'Russian money', 'trump card', 'EU countries', 'financial funds', 'HTML5 video', 'principal amount', 'Agathe Demarais', 'US companies', 'US government', 'Ukraine', 'overview', 'issue', 'property', 'owner', 'transaction', 'transfer', 'restrictions', 'case', 'form', 'cash', 'bonds', 'yachts', 'sanctions', 'implementation', 'freezes', 'CSDs', 'access', 'ECFR', 'DW.', 'result', 'country', 'move', 'war', 'experts', 'presence', 'favor', 'JavaScript', 'total', 'jurisdictions', 'Japan', 'Switzerland', 'Canada', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'reputation', 'litigation', 'Moscow', 'interest', 'Germany', 'France', 'damages', 'aggression', 'defenses', 'fears', 'hook', 'addition', 'Malta', 'Bulgaria', 'needs', 'Merz', 'Kyiv', 'interim', 'less', 'part', 'leaked', 'version', 'conflict', 'Washington', 'Image', 'ZUMA', 'picture']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,dw.com

Belgium  where the majority of those assets are held  is holding out against using them  fearing it would be on the hook to repay the full amount if Russia attempted to claw back the money. Other countries  Italy included  have also expressed doubts about using the frozen Russian assets.Meloni made it clear Wednesday that Italy has not made a decision on whether to support the use of frozen assets.Italy had “decided not to withhold its support for the regulation establishing theimmobilization of Russian assets — though I want to underline clearly that we have not yet endorsed any decision on how to use them ” she said. “We did so despite not agreeing with the method used  to avoid any doubt about Italy’s consistent line of support for Ukraine.”Meloni made it clear that “decisions of such legal  financial and institutional magnitude — including any potential use of frozen assets — must be taken by leaders.”“We believe that if this path [using the frozen Russian assets] is taken  it would be shortsighted to focus attention on a single entity holding frozen Russian sovereign assets — namely Euroclear [which is based in Belgium] — when other partner nations also have immobilized assets in their financial systems.”The Italian prime minister also said she intended to “request clarity on the possible risks linked to the proposal to use the liquidity generated by the immobilization of assets — particularly reputational risks  risks of retaliation  or risks of imposing new burdens on national budgets.”,neutral,0.16,0.81,0.03,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['crucial EU summit', 'Europe', 'leaders', 'pressure', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'pressing, unresolved issue', 'Italian prime minister', 'other partner nations', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Other countries', 'frozen assets', 'war efforts', 'full amount', 'consistent line', 'legal, financial', 'institutional magnitude', 'single entity', 'financial systems', 'new burdens', 'national budgets', 'potential use', 'possible risks', 'reputational risks', 'Thursday', 'summit', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'access', 'Belgium', 'majority', 'hook', 'money', 'Italy', 'doubts', 'Meloni', 'decision', 'support', 'regulation', 'immobilization', 'method', 'leaders', 'path', 'attention', 'Euroclear', 'clarity', 'proposal', 'liquidity', 'retaliation']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,politico.eu

Discover SCENEThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation unveiled plans on Wednesday to issue tokenized securities on Canton Network  the privacy-enabled blockchain built for financial institutions.The infrastructure company  which processed $3.7 quadrillion in transactions last year  said the process will initially involve the creation of tokens representing U.S. Treasuries. The move marks DTCC’s first step in a years-long roadmap  according to a press release.The securities will be held by DTCC for safekeeping  underscoring efforts on Wall Street to tap blockchains for financial efficiencies  while accommodating existing rules. Still  DTCC’s announcement showcased its deepening ties to the digital realm.﻿DTCC said that it will assume a leadership position within Canton’s decentralized governance structure. Moving forward  DTCC will be co-chair of Canton Foundation alongside Euroclear  the Belgium-based infrastructure provider servicing overseas markets.In a statement  DTCC CEO Frank La Salla said the endeavor creates a framework to bring “high-value tokenization use cases to market ” which will expand to other networks and assets.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a three-year pilot for DTCC last week  allowing the company to issue tokens on public or private blockchains. Although Canton was named first  a list of supported networks is expected at a later date.Canton’s ecosystem boasts $6 trillion assets  with over 600 participating institutions  Digital Asset  the company behind the blockchain  said in a press release earlier this month. The network is designed to have configurable privacy and “institutional-grade compliance.”Canton’s native cryptocurrency CC  which began trading last month  rose 2.6% to $0.075 on Wednesday  according to CoinGecko. Its price has fallen 56% since its debut.Earlier this month  Digital Asset disclosed strategic investments from BNY  among the U.S.’s oldest banks  fintech iCapital  Nasdaq  and S&P Global. Earlier this year  the company reported $135 million in funding from names including Goldman Sachs.Canton supports privacy by default through sub-transaction privacy. On most blockchains  transactions are public for all to see. But Canton’s users can only see aspects of transactions that directly apply to them  on a need-to-know basis.On X  Don Wilson  CEO of trading firm DRW  described Wednesday’s announcement as a harbinger for Wall Street’s incremental embrace of digital assets that reflects “a fundamental shift in how markets will operate going forward.”“The transformation is accelerating  and this is just the start ” he added.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.02,True,English,"['DTCC', 'Quadrillion', 'Transactions', 'Treasuries', 'Canton', 'DTCC CEO Frank La Salla', 'high-value tokenization use cases', 'The U.S. Securities', 'The Depository Trust', 'U.S. Treasuries', 'decentralized governance structure', 'native cryptocurrency CC', 'S&P Global', 'Belgium-based infrastructure provider', 'other approved networks', 'other networks', 'tokenized securities', 'first step', 'yearslong roadmap', 'Entertainment Hub', 'Clearing Corporation', 'financial institutions', 'years-long roadmap', 'press release', 'Wall Street', 'financial efficiencies', 'existing rules', 'deepening ties', 'digital realm', 'leadership position', 'Exchange Commission', 'three-year pilot', 'later date', '600 participating institutions', 'Digital Asset', 'institutional-grade compliance', 'strategic investments', 'oldest banks', 'fintech iCapital', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Don Wilson', 'incremental embrace', 'fundamental shift', 'infrastructure company', 'private blockchains', '$6 trillion assets', 'configurable privacy', 'sub-transaction privacy', 'most blockchains', 'privacy-enabled blockchain', 'overseas markets', 'trading firm', 'Canton Foundation', 'Canton Network', 'brief', 'list', 'Decrypt', 'Fashion', 'SCENE', 'plans', 'Wednesday', 'transactions', 'process', 'creation', 'tokens', 'move', 'safekeeping', 'efforts', 'announcement', 'chair', 'Euroclear', 'statement', 'endeavor', 'framework', 'public', 'ecosystem', 'CoinGecko', 'price', 'debut', 'BNY', 'Nasdaq', 'funding', 'names', 'default', 'users', 'aspects', 'basis', 'DRW', 'harbinger', 'transformation', 'start']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,decrypt.co

The chances of failure are significant. Their actions this week could set dangerous precedents and a wrong move could undermine trust among the bloc’s 27 member countries for years to come.Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will require a total of 137 billion euros ($160 billion) in 2026 and 2027. It must get the money by spring. The EU has pledged to come up with the funds  one way or another.“One thing is very  very clear ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers on Wednesday. “We have to take the decision to fund Ukraine for the next two years in this European Council.”European Council President António Costa  who will chair the summit  has vowed to keep the leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.High-risk loanThe European Commission has proposed that the leaders use some of the frozen assets — totaling 210 billion euros ($246 billion) — to underwrite a 90 billion-euro ($105 billion) “reparations loan” to Ukraine. The U.K.  Canada and Norway would fill the gap.The plan is contentious. The European Commission insists that its reasoning and legal basis are sound. But the European Central Bank has warned that international trust in the euro single currency could be damaged  if the leaders are suspected of seizing the assets.Most of the frozen assets belong to the Russian Central Bank and are held in the financial clearing house Euroclear  which is based in Brussels. Belgium fears Russian reprisals  through the courts or in other more nefarious ways.Euroclear fears for its reputation. It believes the commission’s idea is legally shaky and that international investors might look elsewhere  if it transfers the Russian assets to an EU debt instrument  as von der Leyen’s plan demands.Last week  the Russian Central Bank announced that it’s suing Euroclear in a Moscow court. The chances that the case will succeed appear limited  but the move does increase pressure on all parties before the summit.Unlikely plan BThe commission  the EU’s powerful executive branch  has proposed a second option. It could try to raise the money on international markets  much in the way it underwrote a major economic recovery fund after the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Belgium prefers this option. But plan B would require all 27 leaders to agree for it to work  and Hungary refuses to fund Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sees himself as a peacemaker. He’s also Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe.In contrast  plan A — the reparations loan — only requires a majority of around two-thirds of member countries to pass. Hungary can’t veto it alone. Slovakia might say no. Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy and Malta remain to be convinced.Even if all six countries reject the loan to Ukraine — which would only be refunded if Russia ends its war and pays hundreds of billions of euros in war damages  something many Europeans doubt Putin would do — they still wouldn’t have a blocking minority.Running a steamroller over Belgium  which has a great stake in the outcome and deep concerns about the loan  could undermine the entire European project  making it infinitely more difficult to find voting majorities on other issues in the future.But on the eve of the summit  it remained unclear precisely how the plan would work  what kind of guarantees each country would give to reassure Belgium it doesn’t face Russia alone  and even whether the leaders can actually approve it outright this week.“It’s a really new approach. Everyone has questions ” according to a senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations  which continued on Wednesday. “You’re talking about mobilizing public finances. Parliaments might need to weigh in.

ShareBRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders are about to attempt something they’ve never tried before. The chances of failure are significant. Their actions this week could set dangerous precedents and a wrong move could undermine trust among the bloc’s 27 member countries for years to come.At a summit starting on Thursday  many of the leaders will press for tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to be used to meet Ukraine’s economic and military needs for the next two years.Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will require a total of 137 billion euros ($160 billion) in 2026 and 2027. It must get the money by spring. The EU has pledged to come up with the funds  one way or another.“One thing is very  very clear ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers on Wednesday. “We have to take the decision to fund Ukraine for the next two years in this European Council.”European Council President António Costa  who will chair the summit  has vowed to keep the leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.High-risk loanThe European Commission has proposed that the leaders use some of the frozen assets — totaling 210 billion euros ($246 billion) — to underwrite a 90 billion-euro ($105 billion) “reparations loan” to Ukraine. The U.K.  Canada and Norway would fill the gap.The plan is contentious. The European Commission insists that its reasoning and legal basis are sound. But the European Central Bank has warned that international trust in the euro single currency could be damaged  if the leaders are suspected of seizing the assets.Most of the frozen assets belong to the Russian Central Bank and are held in the financial clearing house Euroclear  which is based in Brussels. Belgium fears Russian reprisals  through the courts or in other more nefarious ways.Euroclear fears for its reputation.

54349,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/17/business/eu-russia-frozen-assets-ukraine-wwk-intl,Europe might tap Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine. Here’s what you need to know about the unprecedented plan,The European Union is on the precipice of a momentous decision on whether to use frozen Russian assets to finance more support for Ukraine. Critics argue the plan is legally questionable and risks retaliation by Moscow.,The European Union is on the precipice of a momentous decision on whether to use frozen Russian assets to finance more support for Ukraine  an unprecedented plan that has set up a clash between the many member states that support it and Belgium  where the lion’s share of the assets is held.EU leaders are due to decide on the measure at a crucial summit scheduled for Thursday and Friday.But such potential use of the assets is steeped in controversy – critics argue it is legally questionable and risks retaliation by Moscow.It’s a big moment for Europe  and disagreements surrounding the funding proposal are putting EU divisions on display at a time when the bloc faces increased scrutiny from the United States  which has its own ambitions for the frozen assets.The EU has committed to financing Ukraine for the next two years either way  so if the contentious proposal doesn’t pass  European governments will need to find the money elsewhere amid growing fatigue with the war and pressure on public finances.It also comes as the temperature of Russian threats to Europe is rising  and the Kremlin has warned that any appropriation of the assets won’t go unpunished.What exactly is on the table?In simple terms  the EU wants to borrow frozen Russian funds held in financial institutions in Europe and use them to lend money to Ukraine until Russia pays reparations.Here’s a more detailed explanation: The EU immobilized the local assets of the Russian central bank in 2022 as part of sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Until now  the bloc has been using the interest from the assets – which are mostly bonds – to finance some of its support for Kyiv.But on December 3  the European Commission unveiled a proposal to go further and effectively use the assets themselves to extend a loan to the war-torn country. The EU’s executive arm referred to the assets’ main part  or principal  as well as the interest and other income from them as “cash balances” since  as the bonds mature and become due for repayment  they are turned into cash.The commission noted that  because of the EU sanctions  any payments of principal and income from the assets to Russia’s central bank are prohibited  and it argued that the resulting cash balances are not the bank’s property.Euroclear  an international fund depository based in Belgium  holds most of the Russian assets immobilized in the European Union. Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images“We’re taking the cash balances  we’re providing them to Ukraine as a loan  and Ukraine has to pay back this loan if and when Russia is paying reparations ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters.The Russian central bank assets held in the bloc are worth about €210 billion ($246 billion). “This is therefore the maximum loan amount we could propose ” said Valdis Dombrovskis  a senior commission official in charge of economic policy.Over the next two years  the commission wants to lend Ukraine €90 billion ($105 billion) of that amount  covering two-thirds of what the International Monetary Fund estimates the country will need in 2026 and 2027 for civilian and military purposes.The so-called reparations loan needs to be approved by a “qualified majority ” von der Leyen said  meaning that more than half of the EU’s member states  representing at least 65% of the bloc’s population  will need to vote in favor.The loan has been proposed at a time when a number of European governments  including Germany  Poland and the Baltic states  are keen to find new ways to finance Ukraine  after years of EU taxpayers picking up the tab.Also on December 3  the European Commission put forward an alternative proposal: for the EU to borrow money from investors  using the EU budget as a guarantee  and then lend those funds to Ukraine. This measure requires unanimous approval from all member states  which means it could face an effective veto from pro-Russian countries like Hungary and Slovakia.What are the concerns raised by Belgium and others?Euroclear  a securities depository in Belgium  holds most of the Russian assets immobilized in the EU. Estimates of the amount in the country vary – in September  the European Parliament put it at €180 billion ($211 billion). An estimated €176 billion of that has now turned into cash.The Belgian government has raised a number of concerns about the reparations loan. A key one is that Russia will view it as an illegal repurposing of its sovereign assets.“We have repeatedly said that we consider the option of the reparations loan the worst of all  as it is risky – it has never been done before ” Belgium’s Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prévot said on December 3. “We keep on pleading for an alternative – namely  the EU borrowing the amounts needed on the markets.”The European Commission has tried to bring Belgium on board by asking EU member states to provide guarantees for the loan. These will cover “any member state if it is forced to pay the claim from Russia ” Dombrovskis said.But the Belgian government has deemed those guarantees “too limited ” worrying that they won’t cover its other potential costs  such as those of fighting a lawsuit against Euroclear  said Peter Van Elsuwege  a professor of EU law at Ghent University in Belgium.“The problem for Belgium is that – under the current proposal – only the repayment of the loan may be guaranteed but those additional costs are not (yet) covered  which exposes Belgium to a risk of bearing those additional costs ” he told CNN.Belgium has also insisted on protection against any countermeasures Russia may take against Euroclear’s assets in Russia and beyond.Belgium's Prime Minister Bart de Wever  seen here arriving for a meeting with the British prime minister on December 12  2025  has repeatedly said the option of a reparations loan is risky. Ben Stansall/Pool/ReutersThe Russian central bank has already filed a lawsuit seeking billions in damages from Euroclear  saying it is a pre-emptive measure against the European Commission’s plan to transfer the assets “to third parties ” according to Russian state news agency TASS.On Thursday the bank announced it would also claim damages from European banks in a Russian arbitration court  for what it called the “illegal blocking and use of its assets.” The damages would be for the amount of the withheld assests and the corresponding lost profit  it said in a statement.The Kremlin could also seize more foreign assets in Russia in retaliation. Around $127 billion is at risk – that’s the estimated value of Russia-based assets belonging to US  EU and UK companies as of 2024  according to the Kyiv School of Economics.“Panicked EU bureaucrats keep blundering ” the Kremlin’s economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev said on X Monday. “They know using Russian reserves without CBR consent is illegal ” he wrote  chiming with the central bank’s own adversarial response to the EU proposal.Other EU countries  such as Italy and the Czech Republic  have also expressed concerns about the plan. The Czech prime minister has said his country will not agree to provide financial guarantees because it needs to reserve its money for Czech citizens.A broader worry is that using the frozen assets could discourage foreign investment in Europe. A country like China  aware that it could face European sanctions if it invaded Taiwan  might be reluctant to place funds in the region  the argument goes.What is the US position on Russia’s frozen assets?The US-backed  28-point plan for ending the war that was leaked last month called for investing $100 billion of the Russian assets frozen around the world “in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine ” and for the United States to receive profits from those investments. The assets frozen in Europe account for the majority of Moscow’s immobilized assets globally.After multiple rounds of negotiations  the latest iteration of the peace plan is unknown  but the European proposal to use the bulk of the global assets for the reparations loan is at odds with those US investment ambitions. US officials said they had discussed Monday the use of frozen Russian assets to finance reconstruction in meetings with the Ukrainian delegation and Europeans.But the EU’s indefinite freezing of the assets it holds  agreed last week  means the bloc holds an important trump card in the negotiations  according to Ghent University’s Van Elsuwege. “The future of these assets cannot be decided by the United States or Russia alone but requires the involvement of the EU.”America’s financial backing for Ukraine dropped off a cliff this year as the Trump administration halted new support packages for the country.Since January 2022  Ukraine’s European allies have allocated a total of $221 billion in military  financial and humanitarian aid for Ukraine  compared with the US allocation of $134 billion  according to data compiled by the Kiel Institute  a European economic affairs think tank.“The frozen assets could balance certain declines in certain countries’ support ” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday. “Without such support  I don’t see the possibility for Ukraine to hold on  or to stand tall economically. I don’t see us being able to cover such big deficits with other vague promises or unclear alternatives.”CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Joseph Ataman contributed to reporting.,neutral,0.09,0.81,0.1,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'unprecedented plan', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prévot', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'The Russian central bank assets', 'International Monetary Fund', 'international fund depository', 'next two years', 'senior commission official', 'many member states', 'The European Union', 'frozen Russian assets', 'resulting cash balances', 'The European Commission', 'assets’ main part', 'EU member states', 'maximum loan amount', 'Foreign Minister', 'Russian threats', 'securities depository', 'frozen assets', 'United States', 'Baltic states', 'European governments', 'European Parliament', 'Russian funds', 'momentous decision', 'unprecedented plan', 'crucial summit', 'potential use', 'big moment', 'growing fatigue', 'public finances', 'simple terms', 'financial institutions', 'detailed explanation', 'executive arm', 'Nicolas Tucat', 'AFP/Getty Images', 'economic policy', 'military purposes', 'qualified majority', 'new ways', 'unanimous approval', 'effective veto', 'pro-Russian countries', 'Belgian government', 'key one', 'illegal repurposing', 'local assets', 'sovereign assets', 'funding proposal', 'contentious proposal', 'EU leaders', 'EU divisions', 'EU taxpayers', 'EU budget', 'other income', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'war-torn country', 'alternative proposal', 'reparations loan', 'EU sanctions', 'precipice', 'support', 'Ukraine', 'clash', 'Belgium', 'lion', 'share', 'measure', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'controversy', 'critics', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'disagreements', 'display', 'time', 'bloc', 'increased', 'scrutiny', 'ambitions', 'money', 'pressure', 'temperature', 'Kremlin', 'appropriation', 'table', 'interest', 'bonds', 'Kyiv', 'December', 'principal', 'repayment', 'payments', 'property', 'Euroclear', 'reporters', 'charge', 'two-thirds', 'civilian', 'half', 'population', 'favor', 'number', 'Germany', 'Poland', 'investors', 'guarantee', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'concerns', 'others', 'Estimates', 'September', 'option', 'amounts', 'markets', 'board', 'claim']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,cnn.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1 2.Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

In Penteo’s latest “Data & AI 2025 Universe Report”  Atos stands out for guiding organizations in the responsible and scalable adoption of AI focusing on real business impact  at a time when data and AI have become the main drivers of business transformation in Spain  reshaping technological architectures  governance models and the role of integrators.Data & AI: The pillars of business competitivenessThe Penteo report notes that in 2025 artificial intelligence has evolved from experimentation phase to a core element of business strategy and a key driver of competitiveness. Organizations now prioritize projects with clear and measurable returns in efficiency  revenue  and cost reduction  relying on quality  governed  and traceable data.Penteo emphasizes Atos’ expertise in addressing this evolving context. Atos manages the entire data and AI lifecycle - from strategy and architecture to industrializing models in production - using advanced analytics  machine learning  generative AI and automation. This approach is supported by mature DataOps  MLOps and DevOps practices that facilitate the scalability and sustainability of use cases.“This new Penteo report clearly reflects the shift we are witnessing in Spain and  more broadly  across Europe. Artificial intelligence is moving within companies from the experimental phase to becoming an essential driver of competitiveness  business success and customer satisfaction. Atos’ teams are fully committed to supporting clients of all sizes and industries through this transformation  keeping security  responsibility and sovereignty at the heart of our priorities  as evidenced by recent Data & AI projects delivered to the Spanish public sector.” said xxx  Atos.The rise of next-generation Data & AI integratorPenteo identifies the rise of ""next-generation Data & AI integrator ""as a key trend in a complex market  shaped by hybrid and multicloud environments  the coexistence of traditional data warehouses with lakehouse  data mesh and data fabric models  and the growth of automation and orchestration of platforms and models.Atos meets this demand with a comprehensive approach that combines strategic consulting  technology platforms  data engineering and applied AI  enabling the transformation of isolated initiatives into scalable AI programs—especially in regulated sectors like banking  energy  industry  public sector  and health.Trust  regulation and data sovereigntyDigital sovereignty  security and regulatory compliance have become critical for organizations  driven by new European regulatory frameworks such as the Data Act and the AI Act. Companies demand solutions that guarantee data residency  explainability of models and an ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence.Atos integrates data governance  cybersecurity and AI ethics in a transversal way  providing customers the confidence to adopt advanced technologies without compromising their regulatory obligations or their long-term sustainability.An uneven market that demands pragmatic and scalable approachesThe maturity of the Spanish market is uneven: while large organizations scale up data and AI architectures  midsize companies adopt AI in targeted processes for quick results. Atos has proven its ability to adapt its value proposition for organizations of different sizes  offering both tailored and standardized solutions that facilitate a progressive adoption of AI  focusing on economic impact  operational efficiency and long-term sustainability.The report finally emphasizes that lasting success in data and AI relies not only on how quickly organizations adopt new technologies  but also on their ability to industrialize  measure  and sustain value. In this environment  Atos stands out as a reliable technology partner  enabling transformation built on trust  accountability and proven results.Recent public sector projects demonstrate this approach  such as those developed by Atos in collaboration with the Community of Madrid and the Madrid City Council  aimed at improving citizen engagement and service efficiency through AI  with full guarantees of regulatory compliance and data sovereignty. The launch of Atos Polaris AI Platform also marked a new milestone  introducing autonomous AI agents capable of planning  reasoning  collaborating  and learning to drive universal automation in business and software engineering.###About Atos GroupAtos Group is a global leader in digital transformation with c. 67 000 employees and annual revenue of c. €10 billion  operating in 61 countries under two brands — Atos for services and Eviden for products.

Kenmare Resources plc(“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)  17 December 2025  Wet Concentrator Plant...,"This announcement contains inside information.Kenmare Resources plc(“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)17 December 2025Wet Concentrator Plant A project update and 2025 guidance updateKenmare Resources plc (LSE: KMR  ISE: KMR)  one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon  which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Mine"" or ""Moma"") in northern Mozambique  provides an update on its Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A upgrade project and its 2025 production guidance.Statement from Ben Baxter  Chief Operations Officer:“Commissioning of the WCP A upgrade project continues to advance  following the work undertaken in September to install two new high-capacity dredges and a new feed preparation module. However  as the volume of ore going through the plant has progressively increased during the past month  some issues have emerged  primarily relating to slimes management.Remedial measures are already having a positive impact and we expect performance to improve further for the remainder of December. However  the plant is now expected to achieve nameplate capacity on a sustainable basis in Q1 2026. The updated schedule is not expected to impact the capital cost estimate of the project  which remains at $341 million.We have chosen to focus on resolving these issues and ramping up WCP A operations  rather than prioritising additional short-term production  given our relatively high levels of product inventory. Consequently  2025 ilmenite production is now expected to be not less than 830 000 tonnes.”Overview of WCP A upgrade projectKenmare is upgrading its largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Moma’s portfolio  representing approximately 70% of its Mineral Resources  and the transition to Nataka will secure Kenmare’s production for decades to come. WCP A will mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which is expected to exceed 20 years.The capital cost estimate of the WCP A upgrade  transition to Nataka  and associated infrastructure  remains unchanged at $341 million  with unallocated contingency remaining within that figure.Update on commissioning of WCP ACommissioning of the WCP A project has continued to advance. Excavated ore volumes from the new dredges over the past month have exceeded the 2025 monthly average prior to the plant shutdown  which included both dredge and dry mining. However  as volumes have increased  some issues have progressively emerged  primarily relating to slimes management.Slimes are ultra fine particles that impact on feed rates and recoveries. The upfront desliming circuit within the new feed preparation module removes slimes from the ore  prior to their transfer to the densification paddock  and this is working effectively. Once the slimes are sufficiently dense  they are pumped to the new Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”)  and clean water is returned from the densification paddock to the mining pond.Currently  the water returning to the mining pond contains excess slimes  indicating that slimes pumping capacity between the densification paddock and the TSF requires optimisation. Additional pumping capacity has been installed and supplementary clean water is being added to the mining pond to increase recoveries. The Company expects performance of the slimes management system to continue to improve during December and further work will also be undertaken over the coming weeks to support the plant in consistently achieving design capacity.The two new high-capacity dredges have demonstrated their ability to deliver excavated ore volumes at nameplate capacity; however further work is required to address intermittent interruptions. Kenmare previously believed that all commissioning issues with the dredges had been resolved  but as the ramp up has progressed  it has become clear that additional adjustments to the automation systems are required and these are in progress.As a result of these recent challenges  Kenmare now expects WCP A to achieve its nameplate capacity of 3 500 tonnes per hour on a consistent basis during Q1 2026.In relation to the on-plant tailings management system  which was mentioned in the previous announcement  significant work has already been undertaken to improve mass and water balances and further optimisation work is underway.2025 guidance updateThe Company is prioritising bringing WCP A to nameplate capacity  rather than deploying resources and incurring higher operating costs to produce additional ilmenite  in line with its value over volume approach.During the year-to-date  Moma has produced over 800 000 tonnes of ilmenite and Kenmare now expects 2025 ilmenite production to be not less than 830 000 tonnes. This reflects the production impacts associated with the commissioning of WCP A and normal production expectations from the Company’s other mining operations. Production guidance for Kenmare’s other products remains as stated in the Company’s announcement on 18 November 2025.Shipments are now expected to be approximately 980 000 tonnes of finished products in 2025  as two shipments appear likely to complete loading in early 2026  meaning they will benefit H1 2026 performance.Total cash operating cost guidance remains at $228 to $252 million.As previously announced  Kenmare will release its Q4 2025 Production Report  including its guidance for 2026  on Wednesday 21 January 2026.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted orphan designation to efdoralprin alfa (SAR447537  formerly known as INBRX-101)  an investigational recombinant human alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)-Fc fusion protein  for the potential treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) related emphysema  a rare respiratory condition with great unmet medical need.The EMA grants orphan designation to potential new medicines addressing rare  life-threatening or debilitating medical diseases or conditions that affect no more than 5 in 10 000 individuals in the EU.Efdoralprin alfa demonstrated superiority to a standard of care plasma-derived therapy in adults with AATD when dosed every three weeks (Q3W) or every four weeks (Q4W)  meeting all primary and key secondary endpoints in the global phase 2 ElevAATe study (clinical study identifier: NCT05856331).The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously granted both fast track and orphan drug designation to efdoralprin alfa for the treatment of AATD related emphysema. Efdoralprin alfa is currently in clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Sanofi plans to present the data at a forthcoming medical meeting and engage with global regulatory authorities on the appropriate next steps.About efdoralprin alfaEfdoralprin alfa (SAR447537  formerly known as INBRX-101) is a recombinant human AAT-Fc fusion protein being investigated in adults with AATD emphysema  with Q3W or Q4W dosing. The investigational restorative recombinant treatment is being studied to restore functional AAT levels to the normal range and inhibit neutrophil elastase  an enzyme that can cause lung tissue damage in patients with AATD. Efdoralprin alfa was granted fast track designation and orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of AATD emphysema in addition to this latest orphan designation from the EMA.About AATDAATD is a rare  inherited disorder characterized by low levels or absence of AAT  a protein produced by the liver that protects the lungs from inflammation and damage. The disease causes progressive deterioration of the tissue of the lungs and liver. Without adequate AAT levels  affected individuals often experience lung damage and develop COPD  including emphysema  and in severe forms of the disease  patients can sometimes require lung transplantation. Plasma-derived therapies were introduced in 1987 to treat the condition but since then  no new therapies have been introduced. About 235 000 people worldwide live with AATD  with nearly 100 000 people in the US  but about 90% of individuals with AATD are likely undiagnosed.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

The weapon of choice is neither artillery nor drones  but sovereign debt and international banking law. At the cente…,As the war in Ukraine grinds toward its fourth winter  a parallel conflict is being fought not in the trenches of the Donbas  but in Brussels. The weapon of choice is neither artillery nor drones  but sovereign debt and international banking law. At the center of this financial storm lies a cache of wealth: nearly €200 billion in Russian Central Bank assets  immobilized since the onset of the full-scale invasion in 2022.The European Union has moved beyond merely freezing these funds. In a landmark and legally perilous shift  the bloc has begun to actively utilize the profits generated by this capital to fund Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction. This strategy  however  has exposed deep fissures within the EU and placed a singular  private Belgian company  Euroclear  in the geopolitical crosshairs.The vault: Euroclear and the mechanics of immobilizationTo understand the scale of the situation  one must understand the custodian holding the keys. Euroclear is not a bank in the traditional consumer sense; it is a Central Securities Depository (CSD)  a critical piece of the “plumbing” that underpins the global financial system. Headquartered in Brussels  Belgium  and employing approximately 6 000 people  Euroclear settles securities transactions for stock exchanges and major financial institutions  ensuring that when a bond or share is traded  the ownership transfers and the cash is delivered.A consortium of major international financial players owns Euroclear. Its shareholder registry includes Caisse de Dépôts (a French public-sector financial institution)  GIC (the sovereign-wealth fund of Singapore)  Euronext (the pan-European stock exchange) and Sicovam  the French central securities custodian (now integrated into the group structure but historically a key stakeholder).The sheer volume of assets flowing through Euroclear is difficult to visualize. At the end of the third quarter (Q3) of 2025  Euroclear held a staggering €42.5 trillion in custodial assets. Much of this sum is held on behalf of clients — pension funds  central banks and commercial banks — and does not sit on Euroclear’s own balance sheet.However  income generated by Russian-owned securities does end up on Euroclear’s books. As of the latest financial disclosures  Euroclear Bank’s own balance sheet stood at €229 billion. Of this amount  a massive €194 billion — nearly 85% — is classified as “related to sanctioned Russian assets.” These are primarily maturing bonds and coupon payments belonging to the Central Bank of Russia that sanctions have blocked. Unable to be transferred back to Moscow  this cash piles up in Belgium  requiring reinvestment.The “windfall”: turning cash into weaponsIn the first half (H1) of 2025 alone  these immobilized Russian assets generated €2.7 billion in interest income. Under normal circumstances  this profit would belong to the client (Russia). However  the EU argues that these “windfall profits” are not sovereign assets but rather a byproduct of the sanctions regime itself.Following legislation passed in May 2024  the EU formalized a mechanism to seize these profits. Of the €2.7 billion earned in H1 2025  €1.8 billion was declared a “windfall contribution.” After Belgian corporate taxes and management fees were deducted  a net total of €1.6 billion was paid out to the EU Commission.The money is transferred to the Ukraine Facility and the European Peace Facility (EPF)  where it is used to directly reimburse EU member states for weapons shipments to Kyiv and to fund the purchase of new ammunition and air defense systems. In effect  the EU has successfully engineered a system where Russia’s own sovereign wealth is partially financing the war effort against it.The Belgian resistance: fear of the “Euroclear run”While the EU Commission in Brussels pushes for aggressive use of these funds  the Belgian government  located just a few miles away  has urged extreme caution. Belgium finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being the sole guardian of the vast majority of Russia’s frozen wealth.Belgium’s resistance is not rooted in sympathy for Moscow  but in fear for the stability of its financial sector and the Euro itself. The Belgian government  along with Euroclear’s management  strongly opposes the full confiscation of the principal assets (the €194 billion itself)  as opposed to just the interest profits.The primary concern is legal precedent and “capital flight.” If the EU were to seize the principal assets  it would cross a Rubicon in international law  effectively declaring that sovereign property is no longer immune. Belgium fears this would send a shockwave through the Global South. Large international asset owners — such as Saudi Arabia  China  Brazil or Indonesia — might look at the precedent and decide that the Eurozone is no longer a safe haven for their reserves.If these nations were to move their securities custody from Euroclear (EU) to competitors in Dubai  Hong Kong or a potential future BRICS-created depository  it could trigger a “run” on Euroclear. Given that Euroclear holds €42.5 trillion in assets  even a partial exodus would be catastrophic for European capital markets.Furthermore  Belgium fears it would be left holding the bag for the inevitable legal retaliation. Russia has already filed dozens of lawsuits in Russian courts against Euroclear  seizing the entity’s meager assets within Russia. Belgium worries that if the principal is confiscated  it will face decades of litigation and potential liability for billions of euros  potentially bankrupting the custodian without an explicit backstop from the rest of the EU.The legal hammer: triggering Article 122Recognizing that unanimity on Russia policy is becoming impossible due to resistance from member states like Hungary and Slovakia  the EU Commission has resorted to a powerful and controversial legal tool: Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).Traditionally designed for economic emergencies (such as the energy crisis or natural disasters)  Article 122 allows the Council to adopt measures by a qualified majority  bypassing the need for unanimous consent.This month  the EU triggered Article 122 to fundamentally alter the sanctions regime. Previously  sanctions on Russian assets had to be renewed every six months by a unanimous vote. This gave leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary a biannual opportunity to hold the bloc hostage  threatening to veto the renewal unless concessions were made elsewhere.By invoking Article 122  the EU has moved to freeze the assets indefinitely until Russia ends the war and compensates Ukraine. This move serves two purposes:Political Insulation: It removes the assets from the six-month veto cycle  locking them down regardless of shifting political winds in Budapest or Bratislava. Collateralization: It provides the legal certainty needed to use the assets as collateral for larger loans. If the assets are guaranteed to remain frozen for years  G7 nations can issue “Reparations Loans” to Ukraine  to be repaid by the future income streams (or the eventual confiscation) of the Russian funds.The implication of using Article 122 is profound. It signals a shift in the EU toward a more federalized  majority-rule foreign policy  much to the chagrin of smaller  neutrality-inclined states.The geopolitical fallout: BRICS+ and the EuroThe aggressive utilization of these assets has not gone unnoticed in Beijing  Riyadh or Brasília. For the BRICS+ nations  the “weaponization of finance” confirms their long-held suspicions about the Western-led order.The immediate impact has been a “quiet diversification.” While a wholesale dumping of the Euro has not occurred — simply because there are few liquid alternatives to the Dollar and Euro — trust in the EU as a neutral arbiter of capital has eroded. Central banks in the Global South are increasingly repatriating gold reserves and exploring non-Euro settlement mechanisms for trade.The danger for the Euro is slow but existential. If the perception solidifies that Euro-denominated assets are subject to political seizure  the Euro’s status as an alternative reserve currency could diminish over the next decade. This would raise borrowing costs for all European governments  as demand for European debt softens. Belgium’s resistance is essentially a warning: Do not sacrifice our long-term financial credibility for a short-term cash injection for Ukraine.Alternative legal avenuesCritics of the EU’s approach argue that there were other  perhaps more legitimate  paths to making Russia pay.International Reparations Mechanism: The standard path would be a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) mandating reparations. However  Russia does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction in this matter  and enforcement would still require the seizure of assets  bringing the EU back to the same legal hurdle. The Countermeasures Doctrine: Legal scholars have argued that under international law  states can take “countermeasures” against an aggressor to induce compliance. This theory posits that seizing assets is a lawful countermeasure to Russia’s illegal invasion. The US has largely backed this interpretation  but European legal scholars (and the Belgian government) remain skeptical  viewing it as a slippery slope that blurs the line between executive action and judicial process.The Trump factor: pressure from across the AtlanticHovering over this entire debate is the shadow of the White House. With Donald Trump in office in late 2025  the dynamic has shifted dramatically. The Trump administration has made it clear that American taxpayers should no longer foot the primary bill for a war in Europe’s backyard.Pressure from Washington has been intense. The US has pushed the EU to stop “dithering” with interest payments and seize the full €194 billion principal to fund the war effort  thereby allowing the US to reduce its own financial aid. Trump’s “Peace through Strength” rhetoric implies that if Europe wants Ukraine to survive  Europe must pay for it  using Russian President Vladimir Putin’s money.This pressure partially explains the EU’s rush to trigger Article 122 and lock in the loan mechanisms this month. European leaders fear that if they do not present a self-sustaining funding model for Ukraine soon  the Trump administration might cut aid entirely or force a peace deal on terms unfavorable to Kyiv. The mobilization of Euroclear’s assets is  in many ways  Europe’s attempt to “Trump-proof” the defense of Ukraine.The €194 billion questionThe situation at Euroclear represents a defining moment for the intersection of law  finance and war. The EU has managed to uncork a stream of billions to aid Ukraine  paying for weapons with the aggressor’s own accrued interest. Yet  in doing so  it has ventured into uncharted legal territory  risking the reputation of its financial system and bypassing its own democratic unanimity rules.For now  the €1.6 billion transferred to Ukraine is a lifeline. But as the war drags on and reconstruction costs mount into the hundreds of billions  the temptation to seize the full €194 billion sitting in Brussels will only grow. Belgium stands as the final gatekeeper  holding the line against a move that could redefine the concept of sovereign property forever. Whether that line holds against the combined pressure of a desperate Kyiv  a federalizing Brussels and an isolationist Washington remains the €194 billion question.[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.,neutral,0.0,0.85,0.14,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['The Battle', 'Frozen Billions', 'Euroclear', 'Russia', 'Caisse de Dépôts', 'potential future BRICS-created depository', 'Large international asset owners', 'French public-sector financial institution', 'singular, private Belgian company', 'major international financial players', 'French central securities custodian', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'major financial institutions', 'Central Securities Depository', 'The European Union', 'traditional consumer sense', 'latest financial disclosures', 'Belgian corporate taxes', 'international banking law', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'European Peace Facility', 'air defense systems', 'The Belgian resistance', 'global financial system', 'EU member states', 'international law', 'financial storm', 'central banks', 'financial sector', 'Belgian government', 'Russian assets', 'securities transactions', 'Russian-owned securities', 'securities custody', 'stock exchanges', 'Global South', 'custodial assets', 'sovereign assets', 'principal assets', 'fourth winter', 'parallel conflict', 'sovereign debt', 'full-scale invasion', 'perilous shift', 'deep fissures', 'geopolitical crosshairs', 'critical piece', 'ownership transfers', 'shareholder registry', 'sovereign-wealth fund', 'group structure', 'key stakeholder', 'sheer volume', 'third quarter', 'commercial banks', 'balance sheet', 'maturing bonds', 'coupon payments', 'first half', 'normal circumstances', 'net total', 'new ammunition', 'aggressive use', 'extreme caution', 'uncomfortable position', 'sole guardian', 'vast majority', 'full confiscation', 'primary concern', 'sovereign property', 'Saudi Arabia', 'safe haven', 'Hong Kong', 'Ukraine Facility', 'windfall contribution', 'sovereign wealth', 'frozen wealth', 'interest income', 'sanctions regime', 'management fees', 'weapons shipments', 'war effort', 'interest profits', 'legal precedent', 'capital flight', 'EU Commission', 'Euroclear Bank', 'pension funds', 'windfall profits', 'Euroclear run', 'trenches', 'Donbas', 'Brussels', 'choice', 'artillery', 'drones', 'center', 'cache', 'onset', 'landmark', 'bloc', 'reconstruction', 'strategy', 'vault', 'mechanics', 'immobilization', 'situation', 'keys', 'CSD', 'plumbing', 'Belgium', '6,000 people', 'cash', 'consortium', 'GIC', 'Singapore', 'Euronext', 'Sicovam', 'end', 'staggering', 'behalf', 'clients', 'books', 'amount', 'massive €194', 'Moscow', 'reinvestment', 'byproduct', 'legislation', 'May', 'mechanism', 'H1', 'money', 'EPF', 'Kyiv', 'purchase', 'effect', 'fear', 'sympathy', 'stability', 'Rubicon', 'shockwave', 'China', 'Brazil', 'Indonesia', 'Eurozone', 'reserves', 'nations', 'competitors', 'Dubai']",2025-12-17,2025-12-18,fairobserver.com

The data also reinforces obefazimod’s favorable tolerability profile.Obefazimod Shows First Evidence of Activity in Preclinical Fibrotic ModelsThe upcoming oral presentation on anti-fibrotic activity addresses a significant unmet medical need in IBD. Fibrosis  or the excessive formation of scar tissue  is a serious complication  particularly in patients with CD. This scarring can lead to strictures (narrowing of the intestine) that often necessitate surgery. To date  no efficacious anti-fibrotic treatment is available for IBD patients.The objective of the preclinical study was to assess the anti-fibrotic effects of obefazimod in an in vitro fibrosis model using human small-intestinal fibroblasts and in an in vivo TNBS-colitis mouse model. The data from this study  titled “Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease ” will be presented during the oral presentation session on Saturday  February 21  2026.Marc de Garidel  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  said “We are highly enthusiastic about the strong presence of obefazimod data at the 21st ECCO Congress  highlighting the impactful and robust data we have generated in inflammatory bowel disease. Presenting a total of 22 abstracts highlights the increasing depth of clinical understanding we have gained from the ABTECT Induction Trials in ulcerative colitis. This important data  along with the oral presentation highlighting the first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in a preclinical model  demonstrates the potential for obefazimod to address a critical unmet need in IBD beyond inflammation.”Fabio Cataldi  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Abivax  added  “Intestinal fibrosis is a major complication of Crohn’s disease that is not fully addressed by current therapies. This often leads to debilitating symptoms and the need for resection surgery. We look forward to sharing these new insights on obefazimod’s anti-fibrotic properties  alongside the expansive clinical data to demonstrate obefazimod’s potential efficacy and favorable safety profile in ulcerative colitis  with the IBD scientific community in Stockholm.”Obefazimod Data to be Presented:Date & Time Session Room Abstract # Title Presenter Oral Presentation Sat  Feb 2108:40–08:50 Holistic IBD Care - Session 10: Holistic Approach - Multidisciplinary Team Plenary Hall OP30 Obefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease Prof. Silvio Danese  MD  PhDDirector of Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit at IRCCS San.

It is noteworthy that that old needle is truly stuck when it comes to our leader Nikos. It doesn’t budge  the shameless thing (the needle)  not with xylene and Tempi  nor with the OPEKEPEs  with NO-THING. In essence now  I think that every day the pressure on the farmers who are at the roadblocks will increase a bit  and of course they will also get something extra until we get to the other weekend and they start talking seriously. In yesterday’s discussion Mitsotakis spoke  as is customary  on all topics. I single out the proposal to all parties to do something substantive for the primary sector  although I have no hope for real work and cross-party understanding. I cannot fail to mention the jab at politicians who offer “criticism from the couch  but without counterproposals ” which was aimed at Karamanlis  Samaras  and Venizelos  who has recently been added to K.M.’s hate group  openly I would say  because I never truly believe there were traces of sympathy.BudgetI listened yesterday to Pierrakakis’s speech on the budget; he said several interesting things  but I kept two points. The first concerns why the country insists on repaying public debt earlier. The counterargument of the opposition  Right and Left  is that “instead of giving the surplus to the people  we give it to the creditors.” Pierrakakis explained the simple thing: when you repay earlier you save on interest and at the same time you gain credibility with your creditors. That is why investment grades are now being recovered at normal rates. That is  how can a party (any party) not understand what even a simple household manager understands: that the earlier you pay off the installments of your loan (provided you have the money)  the less interest you will pay. The second point  which N.A.  the eagle on economic matters  also referred to (negatively)  concerns private debt. That too was reduced by about 15 points  while the number of performing loans doubled. They may not make “communicative noise ” but for those who grasp basic economics they matter. One would expect at least some “political spaces” to grasp them. Or not?KarystianouNow with Karystianou you see what is happening daily; yesterday we had her public disavowal by the Association of Parents of the Victims of Tempi  and it is certain that as time passes things will become even clearer. I think that Karystianou  like every Greek citizen  has the right to stand for election. Let her say so clearly  when she herself wishes and not all of us or her political opponents  and let her proceed. However  the other 56 families who lost their children at Tempi also have the same right to say that this tragic event… does not have a political leader or party boss in Ms. Karystianou or anyone else. From what we know from reporting  the overwhelming majority of these families do not agree with Ms. Karystianou’s political career. One thing is a victim’s mother and another a party leader. I should also note that this sieve of full politicization and party politicization and  of course  political exploitation of everything was done only by the Left. It did not happen at Mati with the 105 dead  nor at Mandra  nor with the “Samina ” nor ever anywhere in the country.OPEKEPE and pollsSince we are talking about party exploitation  let’s also go a bit to OPEKEPE. The day before yesterday two polls were released from which it follows that the only winner from the image of the Investigative Committee with “Frappe” was Konstantopoulou. She gained 1–2 points with those hysterics she was having on camera  calling 100 to arrest him (Mr. Frappe) because he threatened her  etc. This whole show went viral on TikTok and Zoitsa took off  as in the days of the xylene. For how long I don’t know  but she did take off in the percentages. Conclusion: when the people… want spectacle  they go to the original  and only Zoitsa sells original madness; the others  and especially the PASOK people  don’t get even a single point.The cliff  the stream  and the expulsion (PASOK news)Nerves are stretched—to the maximum—at Charilaou Trikoupi after the successive blows by the PASOK MP in border-region Lesbos  Panagiotis Paraskevaidis. One day (Monday) he came out and said something like “cooperation both with Tsipras and with Zoi.” The next day (yesterday Tuesday) he “hit” toward his namesake Doudounis so that the leadership would hear it too. They may be namesakes with Panagiotis Doudounis and he accepts that  of course  without a problem—but he does not want them to become co-candidates  and indeed with the blessings of President Nikos. “Mr. Doudounis is not known to the people  he has not lived a single day in Mytilene; it’s just that his father was from Mytilene and now he comes as a ‘parachutist’ because that’s how the president wants him ” declared (on Parapolitika 90.1) the sole green MP in the two-seat district of Lesbos  further irritating Charilaou Trikoupi over the welcoming to the outskirts of Mytilene of Androulakis’s close associate by Paraskevaidis. Doudounis is seeking a “move” from the electable State list position to Lesbos  where the same is desired by Giorgos Petrelis—he is also an Androulakis supporter  a member of the Central Committee  whose wedding this August Androulakis and members of his circle attended. Will Androulakis expel Paraskevaidis for his not-so-comradely statements with Doudounis as the immediate recipient  who however is running in the same district without the ballots yet having been announced? The hotheads proposed to Androulakis “expulsion  here and now  and you’ve already delayed too much… for some.” Yesterday the day was devoted to the budget—today  which it is not  do you think Androulakis will expel the Lesbos MP  who however would have no problem at all moving to Tsipras’s party? Ahead a cliff and behind a stream. And in the middle the… unmoving needle…Bid farewell to the Prodea you knewRecent developments at Prodea with the simultaneous announcement of two agreements (Papalekkas and National) for the sale of assets worth €1.186 billion appear to constitute the first stage of a plan that will create not only new balances but also a trajectory for the listed company. After all  Prodea itself does not hide it. In the information memorandum for the extraordinary general meeting it convened  it states that “the company intends to continue the disposals of real estate assets that do not fall within the main pillars of its investments (logistics and hospitality)  with the aim of reshaping the composition of its investment portfolio.” I pass over the market whispers that Papalekkas is in a deus ex machina role or that everything looks as if they rushed to finalize the agreements before the end of the year  because these are rumors without significance. But which Prodea are we talking about when the general meeting convened on December 29  with the sole agenda item being to approve the recent agreements and those of the previous two years (€1.186 billion in 2025 and €221.8 million for 55 properties in 2024  total: €1.4078 billion)  states that the value of the assets being sold “represents more than 51% of the total value of the company’s assets”? In short  bid farewell to the Prodea you knew. The agreement raised questions at the Capital Market Commission as well  which asked—quite rightly—for clarifications. From these we learned that Papalekkas has already given Prodea €130 million and the remainder will be given in two installments in 2026  with the net price (for the company Milora  which has most of the properties) being €283.2 million. To soften impressions from the sale  in the relevant announcements Prodea states that assets under management  the commercial valuations of its properties  amount to €1.9 billion. But whom does that console  when the company itself declares that it “intends to continue the disposals of its real estate assets ” and when from the response to the Capital Market Commission we learned that the LTV ratio after the two latest transactions falls to 50%? I don’t know whether it is Euronext  conditions in the real estate market  or something else that triggers these decisions. But after these transactions (Papakelakkas and National and the sale of another 55 properties in Greece and Italy in 2024)  as well as future sales since Prodea states it intends to continue  if after all this a good offer suddenly appears for the hospitality sector as well—e.g.  from Papalekkas  who had sold it to Prodea  or someone else  since the sector is fashionable—will Prodea have reasons to continue being a REIC? Of course  time will show what will happen with Prodea. It remains to be seen whether other indications will appear as well  since usually such major shifts in an organization’s business focus are accompanied by changes in management too.The special anniversary of Alpha BankToday is a special day for Alpha Bank  as at a special event at the Athens Stock Exchange the bank’s CEO  V. Psaltis  will ring the bell to open the session because Alpha Bank completes 100 years of continuous presence in the stock market. A 100-year anniversary is not something common in the Greek market  and the bank celebrated it  among other things  with the completion of the transaction for the acquisition of AXIA  while it has already moved on to the next deal—so more is to come…Greece and illegal gambling: 11 000 websites with bets of €1.7 billion annuallyThe “blacklist” (Blacklist) of the Gaming Commission (EEEP) has reached the impressive number of 11 000 illegal gambling websites. These are domain names and internet protocol addresses that have been blocked by the Commission because through them illegal betting was carried out or attempted in our country. These are the latest figures from the EEEP  with the Commission’s services updating the Blacklist  which dates back to 2013. It is characteristic that in the latest revision (47th) last month  another 616 websites/domain names were added to the list of unlicensed gambling providers compiled by the EEEP. As the scourge of illegal gambling rages on  within the next few months the new legislative framework for the gambling market is expected  which—as announced by the Minister of National Economy and Finance  Kyriakos Pierrakakis—will be a holistic framework that will strike the problem of illegal gambling at its root. The data held by the government and the Gaming Commission show that approximately €1.7 billion is wagered in illegal gambling  which means a loss of state revenues of about half a billion euros  a figure that may be slightly higher  as a new updated study is expected.Hellenic Competition Commission: Meets today on NovibetRegardless of the mess with illegal gambling  the legal market for online games of chance continues to grow rapidly. Specifically  in 2026 we will see new providers as well as possible changes to today’s landscape. Today  moreover  the Plenary of the Hellenic Competition Commission is scheduled to meet regarding the acquisition of Novibet by Allwyn International. In the market  however  it was discussed that for the examination of the deal the Competition Commission requested and received data from the Gaming Commission on market shares in the online gaming sector  but did not ask the opinion of the Hellenic Gaming Commission (EEEP)  as the supervisory authority of gambling companies  as to whether the two companies will indeed have a high combined market share. As if two banks were merging and the Bank of Greece were not asked…Kalantonis’s proposal for housingAt present there are approximately 10 000 available homes in the portfolios of servicers that have “pending maturation issues” (regularization of irregular constructions). In order for these properties to immediately enter the market and put pressure on prices by increasing supply rather than demand  the head of doValue  Theod. Kalantonis  has drawn up an—apparently reasonable—proposal. “Give us the right to sell these properties without having regularized them and establish an obligation for the new owners to regularize them within a reasonable period of time (1–2 years).” If they do not do so  there should be a penalty  e.g. a doubling of ENFIA. In this way  servicers will release thousands of properties onto the market at a low price (since their regularization will be pending)  market prices will fall  while the new owners will rush to renovate the homes because they will have an immediate benefit  together with whatever assistance they receive from the State through renovation programs. For the time being  the proposal is receiving positive comments  but in practice not much is happening.Preferred shares excluded from the OPAP–Allwyn dealA very significant development occurred in the major deal for the merger of OPAP and Allwyn  which came as a result of the feedback the two companies received from the investment community. It was therefore decided to change the structure of the transaction and not to carry out the preferred-share issuance leg  a change that aligns voting rights and economic rights for shareholders—an outcome that underscores the commitment of Allwyn and OPAP to continue the long-term relationship with existing investors. At the same time  as expected  the invitation was published for the convening of OPAP’s Shareholders’ General Meeting  which will take place on January 7  2026. In view of the GM  during which shareholders will be asked to approve the Allwyn–OPAP merger valued at €16 billion  Allwyn International is stepping up purchases of OPAP shares from the Stock Exchange. From December 1 and within two weeks it has purchased blocks with a total value exceeding €48 million. In the last week alone it acquired shares worth €13 million  at prices of €18–18.52 per share. Allwyn’s mass purchases send the message that it shows confidence in the valuation and supports the venture that will create the world’s second-largest listed gaming group.Greek ports in the American backstageGreek ports are entering ever more deeply into the geopolitical game  away from the public spotlight. For Washington they are no longer simple commercial infrastructures  but critical “buttons” in a planning framework that connects energy  defense  and transport security. And Greece is now in a key position. Behind the scenes  American circles are pressing for the creation of alternative and reliable corridors to Central and Eastern Europe. The war in Ukraine acted as an accelerator: the U.S. wants ports outside the Straits  with political stability and direct access to land networks. Greece ticks all the boxes. Alexandroupoli has already “locked in” its role. Military transport and LNG coexist  creating a dual-use model considered successful. Souda remains the stable reference point  with continuous upgrades that indicate permanent presence rather than a temporary need. Interest  however  does not stop there. Other hubs are entering American planning: Kavala and Volos function as reserves  offering flexibility. And in the background Elefsina stands out. The upgrading of the shipyards  the potential utilization of the port  and proximity to Thriasio create a new player that  behind the scenes  is also discussed as a geopolitical “counterweight” to Piraeus. The common denominator is energy. American LNG needs ports with special infrastructure and rapid distribution. At the same time  military needs require security and institutional readiness. That is why the same locations keep recurring in discussions. In Athens they know the game is played on two levels: investments and geopolitics. The question that remains open is whether the country will manage to turn this intense backstage interest into a clear national benefit or whether it will be limited to the role of a useful corridor. That is where the next moves will be judged.The talk-of-the-town Christmas party of KimAnd since the days are approaching  let me mention that a frantic race  without limits  has been underway over the last 24 hours. Many are trying to find a ticket to the Megaron Mousikis for the Christmas concert  others to get into the Vienna Opera  while others are making plans to go to the expensive Alpine resorts. But there are also those—men and women—who are pulling out all the stops to secure an invitation to the Christmas party being hosted this week by Kimberly Guilfoyle at the ambassadorial residence. Any such effort  however  is futile. As I learn  a very high percentage of GDP and of the Greek business scene is expected to be present. Among those who have received the… magic email there is anxiety about festive attire. Attire: Festive  the invitation says. As I learn  there will also be strong representation from the Greek political scene at the event.The shipping revelry at the Meat MarketAnd to continue with the festive mood  let me say that at the Meat Market of the Varvakios Agora  Cass Technava of Phaidon Tomazos held its Christmas party. A large percentage of global tonnage was there and enjoyed the loud music with incredible flavors and the hospitality of the Tomazos family. Among them were Petros Pappas with Emi Livaniou  Antonis Komninos  Billys Panagiotidis  Thanasis Samios  Captain Stefanos Angelakos  Panagiotis Madias  Giorgos Souravlas  and many other shipowners alongside bankers and executives of Greek shipping.Mattresses and the holding companyWhat connection could… mattresses and holding companies have? The column knows at least one… The holding company founded the day before yesterday  Monday December 15  by Georgios Niarchos  principal shareholder and one of the executives of Athenian Mattress Manufacturing  known as Media Strom  of the Niarchos family’s interests. The new company is named “GN Symmetochon Single-Member P.C.” and is headquartered in Markopoulo  that is  in the area where Media Strom’s large factory is located. Its initial capital is €1 792 560  divided into 1 792 560 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €1 each. Georgios Niarchos paid €5 000 in cash and received 5 000 corporate units. At the same time  he contributed 14 500 shares of Athenian Mattress Manufacturing  with an appraised value of €1 787 560  corresponding to 1 787 560 corporate units. According to what is stated in the deed of incorporation  the 14 500 shares have a fair value of €123.28 each  “which arises from the fair value (net position) of ‘Athenian Mattress Manufacturing S.A.’” The management of the company  the handling in general of corporate affairs  and judicial and extrajudicial representation were assigned for an indefinite period to Georgios Niarchos himself.Why Vafeias’s move is not just a cash grabHaris Vafeias of the New York–listed Imperial Petroleum recently completed a direct capital increase of $60 million to two institutional investors  opening the way for further fleet expansion. The Nasdaq-listed company’s announcement clearly sends a message to the market: Imperial is not stopping at conservative steps  but is preparing for strategic growth in both bulkers and tankers. If one looks more closely at the deal  the move resembles a smart capital raise. That is  the company secures liquidity without excessive leverage  keeping the balance sheet lean  while retaining flexibility to exploit opportunities in secondhand or new tonnage. The choice of institutional investors also shows that Imperial is building a strong investor base before proceeding to larger shipping bets. The shipping market is watching: with freight rates in many bulker categories showing upward signs and global oil markets remaining volatile but profitable  Imperial appears ready to capitalize on long-term structural trends. This strategy is clearly financially savvy: high leverage of opportunities  but with measured risk. In short  Vafeias’s move is not just a cash grab. It is a signal to the market that Imperial Petroleum is entering an expansion phase with capital  a strategic plan  and readiness to maximize returns for its shareholders—while at the same time keeping its Greek shipping finesse on Wall Street.PPC and Titan set up a “bulwark” against banking pressuresThe bank-centered decline of the Athens Stock Exchange did not prevent certain heavyweight stocks from “shining ” as they reached new peaks. PPC breached the “castle” of €18 that it had been besieging since the end of last October. Specifically  yesterday it closed at €18.01  while it reached as high as €18.3 at the day’s highs. These are prices last seen in August 2008. At the same time  Titan continued on a trajectory of historical highs. After surpassing €46  the cement company’s share also conquered the €47 peak. In PPC’s case  a recent positive catalyst is the report by Pantelakis Securities  which raised the target price to €23.7. For its part  Titan is moving to the rhythm of its acquisition of Turkey’s Traçim Cement  which is estimated to significantly strengthen the group’s financial figures. A common denominator for both listed companies is data centers. Regarding PPC  the giga factory in Kozani is in the works. Pantelakis also made special reference  stressing that the creation of a data center will be positively received by the market. At the same time  Titan recently announced that it serves 80% of the data center projects currently being built in Greece.VIOHALCO’s early ChristmasYou add the daughters  subtract 30%  and you have the value of the mother. This seems to be the logic behind the crazy rally of VIOHALCO’s share  which yesterday easily surpassed a market capitalization of €3 billion  recording a +75% rise since the beginning of the year. The Stasinopoulos family’s industrial flagship is climbing steadily through a rare combination of fundamental and technical catalysts. NBG Securities had warned the market back in November  announcing that it was initiating coverage with an “Outperform” recommendation and a target price of €11.30  which has already been exceeded. National Bank analysts were saying—then—that the €2.46 billion market capitalization was only 5% higher than subsidiary Cenergy Holdings  leaving out of the valuation the value of ElvalHalcor  Sidenor  and Noval Property. Shortly thereafter Goldman Sachs predicted inflows into the stock following inclusion in the MSCI Small Cap Greece index  a prediction that was also confirmed  with transactions of €2.9 million per day  multiples of this year’s average of €1.1 million. The 9-month results support the valuation  with €1.4 billion of investments over the last five years bearing fruit. The relative reduction in energy costs by 70% and the EU’s protective measures on steel act as reinforcing catalysts. With free float at just 16% and dividend yield of 2.3%–3.1%  the stock combines a growth story with a value play.Lemos “strike” on…landA “strike” in the real estate market  with a… scent of the sea  is foreshadowed by the recent incorporation of a new company. The company is named “Pyrsos Ilysia P.C.”  headquartered in Psychiko  and its purpose is the purchase and sale of real estate  plots of land  residential buildings  etc. The initial share capital amounts to €2 750 000  divided into 2 750 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €1 each. Of these  Markos John Lemos  son of Ioannis  paid €27 500 in cash and received 27 500 corporate units (a 1% stake)  while the company “Biquiti Corporation”  headquartered in Liberia  paid €2 722 500 in cash and received 2 722 500 corporate units (a 99% stake). The management of the company  the general handling of corporate affairs  and its judicial and extrajudicial representation were assigned for an indefinite period to Sinti Tsara. Markos John Lemos comes from the family of Captain Giannis Lemos  the self-made shipowner from Oinousses  with strong clout not only at sea but also in real estate  with many expensive properties in Monaco  London  and Athens. Now  evidently  new investment placements are also being prepared.Underground maneuvering for Trump’s “shadow” central bankerWall Street knows that President Trump intends to announce a “waiting-in-the-wings” central banker to pressure Jerome Powell in the direction of rapidly cutting dollar interest rates. Already the euro–dollar exchange rate stands at €1 = $1.1750. Wall Street also knows that the first name of the “shadow” banker will be Kevin. The game is being played between Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. Over the last 48 hours  Kevin Warsh moved from a 13% probability of taking the role to 47%–48%  overtaking Kevin Hassett  who had reached 85% in early December. Kevin Warsh (54 years old) is the person Wall Street considers “one of its own.” A graduate of Stanford (1992) and Harvard Law (1995)  he began his career at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic adviser to George Bush and  at just 35 years of age  a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. During the major crisis of 2008 (Lehman Brothers)  he became the Fed’s main intermediary with Wall Street and its representative at the G-20. He resigned in 2011 because he was fundamentally opposed to the QE2 quantitative easing program (purchase of $600 billion in bonds). He is a proponent of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet  thereby creating room for lower interest rates. Wall Street fears Kevin Hassett because it considers him “excessively obedient” to President Trump. CNBC said on Monday that “close associates” of the POTUS shifted the balance in favor of Warsh. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan  in a closed meeting with asset managers  spoke openly in favor of Warsh  predicting that Hassett would be more willing to implement drastic interest-rate cuts. The Financial Times wrote that bond investors expressed concerns to the Treasury about the effects of the aggressive rate cuts advocated by Hassett. New York’s society columns note that Kevin Warsh is married to Jane Lauder (granddaughter of Estée Lauder) and is connected by family ties to Ronald Lauder  a close friend of Trump.
