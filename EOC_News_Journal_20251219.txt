54371,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://dpa-international.com/economics/urn:newsml:dpa.com:20090101:251218-99-960627/,EU leaders press Belgium on using Russian assets to fund Ukraine,Belgium was under increasing pressure at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels to back plans to provide Ukraine with billions of euros using frozen Russian...,"Belgium was under increasing pressure at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels to back plans to provide Ukraine with billions of euros using frozen Russian assets to cover Kiev's economic and military needs for the coming years.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned of serious consequences if no solution can be found before current funding schemes for Ukraine run dry.""We have a simple choice: Either money today or blood tomorrow "" Tusk said as he arrived at the EU summit on Thursday.""I am not talking about Ukraine only. I am talking about Europe. This is our decision to make and only ours "" he said.The European Commission has proposed to provide Ukraine with up to €210 billion ($246 billion) in immobilized Russian assets in the EU as a reparations loan  of which €90 billion are meant cover financial and military needs in 2026 and 2027.Kiev would only have to repay the loan if Russia makes reparations after the war — an outcome few see President Vladimir Putin agreeing to.Belgium  where the lion's share of the assets are held and roughly €185 billion are held by Brussels-based firm Euroclear  opposes the plan  citing legal and financial risks.""I think all European leaders have to finally rise to this occasion "" Tusk said.Addressing the Belgian parliament  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever reiterated his concerns on Thursday morning.The Belgium government fears that Moscow could retaliate against private European citizens and companies  for example through expropriations in Russia  and has been calling for safeguards.De Wever has been demanding legally binding and unconditional guarantees from other EU countries covering the entire sum of the loan as well as protection from any potential claims for damages.The loan could  in theory  be approved without Belgium's backing  as it requires only a qualified majority — at least 15 of the EU’s 27 member states representing 65% of the bloc’s population.While it is widely seen as unlikely that other EU countries would move to overrule Belgium  impatience is growing among some leaders.Belgium is ""in a very sensitive place "" said Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa  ""but this is as well a question of political will  not just legal aspects.""""In any political decision  there is always legal aspects. But we are politicians  we are the ones who are making the rules as well.""Joint EU debt as 'PlanB' lacks unanimous supportDe Wever has been advocating for the EU to take on joint debt to fund Ukraine — a move which would require unanimous support from all 27 member countries under EU rules.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  a vocal proponent of the reparations loan  rejected the idea of joint EU borrowing.""We are essentially faced with a choice of using European debt or Russian assets for Ukraine. And my opinion is clear: we must use Russian assets "" said Merz.""I see no better option than precisely this. My impression is that we can reach an agreement. I understand the concerns of some member states  especially the Belgian government  but I hope that we can resolve them together.""Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said that he is opposed to any form of financial aid to Ukraine.Lengthy negotiations expectedNegotiations on financial support for Ukraine are expected to run into overtime with EU leaders likely staying in the Belgian capital until Friday.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa are insisting on finding a solution at the summit in Brussels.""We have to find a solution "" said von der Leyen.Costa  who chairs the summit  said the meeting will not be over ""without a final decision to ensure the financial needs of Ukraine for 2026 and 2027.""",neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,mixed,0.13,0.18,0.69,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'Belgium', 'Ukraine', 'Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'unanimous support De Wever', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'current funding schemes', 'President Antonio Costa', 'private European citizens', 'The European Commission', 'other EU countries', 'joint EU borrowing', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Joint EU debt', 'Belgian parliament', 'joint debt', 'Belgian government', 'Belgian capital', 'European debt', '27 member countries', 'financial support', 'European Council', 'European leaders', 'increasing pressure', 'military needs', 'coming years', 'serious consequences', 'Brussels-based firm', 'unconditional guarantees', 'entire sum', 'potential claims', 'qualified majority', '27 member states', 'sensitive place', 'political will', 'vocal proponent', 'EU leaders', 'financial risks', 'financial aid', 'financial needs', 'legal aspects', 'political decision', 'final decision', 'EU rules', 'simple choice', 'Thursday morning', 'Lengthy negotiations', 'EU summit', 'Belgium government', 'reparations loan', 'plans', 'Ukraine', 'billions', 'euros', 'Kiev', 'economic', 'solution', 'money', 'blood', 'war', 'outcome', 'share', 'Euroclear', 'occasion', 'concerns', 'Moscow', 'companies', 'example', 'expropriations', 'safeguards', 'binding', 'protection', 'damages', 'theory', 'backing', 'bloc', 'population', 'impatience', 'question', 'politicians', 'PlanB', 'move', 'idea', 'opinion', 'option', 'impression', 'agreement', 'form', 'overtime', 'Friday', 'meeting']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,dpa-international.com
54372,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/18/eu-summit-on-knife-edge-over-plan-to-fund-ukraine-using-russian-assets,EU summit on knife-edge over plan to fund Ukraine using Russian assets,The proposal centres on whether the EU can use about $246bn in Russian central bank frozen assets.,EU leaders decide to borrow cash to fund Ukraine’s defence rather than use frozen Russian assets  diplomats said.European Union leaders have agreed to provide an interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years  EU Council President Antonio Costa has said.The leaders decided early on Friday ‍to borrow cash on capital markets to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia rather than use frozen Russian assets  diplomats said.“We have a deal. Decision to provide 90 billion euros [$105.5bn] of support to Ukraine for 2026-27 approved. We committed  we delivered ” Costa said in a post on social media early on Friday.Costa did not specify the source of the funding  which came after EU leaders worked deep into Thursday night to reach an agreement.But a draft text of the summit’s conclusions  seen by the Reuters news agency  said it would come from capital markets  secured against the ⁠EU budget  rather than the bloc proceeding with its contentious plan to use frozen Russian assets for a loan supporting Ukraine’s war effort.At the same ​time  EU governments and the European Parliament will continue discussing setting up a loan for Ukraine that would be based on Russian central ‍bank assets.Friday’s deal will not affect the financial obligations of Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic  which did not want to contribute to the financing of Ukraine  the text said.Kyiv will only repay the EU loan based on joint borrowing once it receives war reparations from Moscow. Until then  the Russian assets will remain immobilised  while the EU has also reserved the right to use them to repay the loan  according to the text.Advertisement“It’s good in the sense that Ukraine will secure funding for two years ” one unnamed EU diplomat told Reuters.The move followed hours of discussions among leaders on the technical ‍and legal details of a loan based ⁠on frozen Russian assets – which turned out to be too complex or politically demanding to sort out at this stage  diplomats said.“We have gone from saving Ukraine to saving face  at least that of those who have been pushing for the use of the frozen assets ” a second EU diplomat said.The main difficulty in the use of the Russian money was providing Belgium – where about 185 billion ($217bn) of the total 210 billion euros ($246bn) of frozen assets are held – with sufficient guarantees against financial and legal retaliation from Moscow.The Kremlin has said it will launch legal action and seize foreign assets in Russia should the plan to use its assets go ahead.Belgium hesitantPrior to Friday’s decision  analysts had said the use of frozen Russian assets was effectively the only viable option for EU funding Ukraine’s war effort. The proposal  however  would be unprecedented  with German state assets not even seized during World War II.In advance of Thursday’s meeting  German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had warned that the chances of agreement remained “50-50”.Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever had told the European Parliament he remained deeply concerned about the legal and financial risks  having previously opposed the measures over fears Belgium could be forced to compensate Russia if courts later ruled the use of the frozen assets was unlawful.Belgium has demanded binding commitments from other EU states to cover all potential liabilities  and wants assurances that Russian assets held outside Belgium would also be used.Some countries  including Germany and the Netherlands  said they were prepared to back up the loan  while others  such as Italy and Bulgaria  were hesitant.Early on Friday  De Wever heralded the pivot towards borrowing on capital markets  saying EU leaders had avoided “chaos and division” with their decision.“We remained united ” he said.Risk of antagonising RussiaRussia’s central bank said on Thursday it would sue European banks in Russian courts over any attempt to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine.Chris Weafer  chief executive of the consultancy Macro-Advisory  told Al Jazeera that Moscow would likely see such a move as the start of a financial war with the EU.“Moscow is now drawing a line on this issue ” Weafer said  adding that Russia would likely “retaliate based on what Europe does”.AdvertisementRussia’s central bank has already launched legal proceedings against Belgian financial institution Euroclear  which holds most of the frozen assets  as well as against institutions in France  Austria and the United Kingdom  Weafer said.Although the EU plan requires only a qualified majority rather than unanimity to move forward  Weafer said the bloc was unlikely to proceed without Belgium’s backing. He added  however  that many EU states were increasingly reluctant or financially unable to continue funding Ukraine directly.“So the EU is desperately looking for an alternative source of money ” Weafer said.,neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['EU summit', 'Russian assets', 'knife-edge', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'EU Council President Antonio Costa', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'one unnamed EU diplomat', 'Russian central \u200dbank assets', 'German state assets', 'second EU diplomat', 'other EU states', 'many EU states', 'World War II', 'next two years', 'Reuters news agency', 'total 210 billion euros', 'Belgian financial institution', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European Union leaders', 'central bank', '90 billion euros', 'frozen assets', 'foreign assets', 'EU budget', 'EU governments', 'European Parliament', 'European banks', 'war effort', 'war reparations', 'financial war', 'Russian money', 'Russian courts', 'EU leaders', 'economic needs', 'capital markets', 'social media', 'same \u200btime', 'financial obligations', 'Czech Republic', 'main difficulty', 'sufficient guarantees', 'The Kremlin', 'viable option', 'financial risks', 'binding commitments', 'potential liabilities', 'chief executive', 'Al Jazeera', 'United Kingdom', 'qualified majority', 'EU plan', 'legal details', 'legal retaliation', 'legal action', 'legal proceedings', 'contentious plan', 'EU loan', 'bloc proceeding', 'joint borrowing', 'alternative source', 'Thursday night', 'draft text', 'interest-free loan', 'Chris Weafer', 'cash', 'Ukraine', 'defence', 'diplomats', 'military', 'Friday', 'deal', 'Decision', 'support', 'post', 'funding', 'agreement', 'summit', 'conclusions', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'financing', 'Kyiv', 'Moscow', 'right', 'Advertisement', 'sense', 'move', 'hours', 'discussions', 'technical', 'stage', 'use', 'Belgium', 'analysts', 'proposal', 'advance', 'meeting', 'chances', 'measures', 'fears', 'assurances', 'countries', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'others', 'Italy', 'Bulgaria', 'pivot', 'chaos', 'division', 'attempt', 'consultancy', 'Macro-Advisory', 'start', 'line', 'issue', 'Euroclear', 'institutions', 'France', 'Austria', 'unanimity', 'backing']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,aljazeera.com

But officials say that scheme has been shelved as it requires unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 leaders  and Russia-friendly Hungary has ruled it out.Meanwhile  US efforts to forge a deal to end the war are set to continue  with officials set to meet Russian negotiators in Miami this weekend to discuss Trump’s peace plan  according to a White House official quoted by the AFP news agency.Large differences remain all around. Ukraine and the US claim there has been progress on the issue of future security guarantees for Kyiv  but disagreements persist over the territory that Ukraine would have to cede.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow would “certainly” achieve its objectives in the war  including seizing the territories it claims are its own.Putin also slammed the West  describing calls in the West to prepare for war with Russia as “hysteria and a lie”.,negative,0.0,0.05,0.95,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['Ukraine drones', 'EU debates', 'war funding', 'Russia', 'Rostov', 'Kyiv', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'United States President Donald Trump', 'Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'United States-led efforts', 'nightly Ukrainian raids', 'Euroclear securities depository', 'key political cover', 'White House official', 'AFP news agency', 'future security guarantees', 'two crew members', 'Russian legal action', 'next two years', 'acting regional governor', 'potential fallback plan', 'overnight drone attack', 'European Union leaders', 'other EU countries', 'European countries', 'Ukrainian drones', 'two homes', 'next year', 'other governments', 'US efforts', 'Russian aggression', 'Russian negotiators', 'Russian assets', 'three people', 'tangible results', 'Yury Slyusar', 'cargo ship', 'port facilities', 'apartment block', '210 billion euros', 'break summit', 'financial help', 'second quarter', '185 billion euros', 'international courts', 'blank cheque', 'indefinite period', 'weighted majority', 'nuclear option', 'complex decisions', 'Russia-friendly Hungary', 'peace plan', 'Large differences', 'US claim', 'Russian territory', 'EU leaders', 'EU fears', 'southern region', 'Wednesday night', 'quick deal', 'unanimous approval', 'Rostov region', '27 leaders', 'Moscow', 'desire', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Kyiv', 'Telegram', 'Thursday', 'fire', 'civilian', 'town', 'Bataysk', 'construction', 'money', 'series', 'Brussels', 'plans', 'country', 'outcome', 'meeting', 'support', 'make', 'basis', 'loan', 'test', 'credibility', 'continent', 'fighting', 'Advertisement', 'threat', 'Belgium', 'damages', 'amount', 'theory', 'initiative', 'commission', 'officials', 'scheme', 'Miami', 'progress', 'issue', 'disagreements', 'objectives', 'territories', 'West', 'calls', 'hysteria', 'lie']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,aljazeera.com

Russia has retaliated by suing Euroclear for $230 billion  framing the move as outright ""theft"" and threatening financial instability.The U.S. has privately warned the EU against confiscation  fearing it could sabotage peace talks. Hungary and Slovakia oppose the plan  forcing Brussels to use emergency powers to maintain the freeze. Belgium fears legal exposure  while Ukraine's worsening debt crisis raises doubts about repayment capacity.Moscow filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in Russian courts  with expected enforcement in friendly jurisdictions like China or the UAE. Russian officials warn that asset seizures will erode trust in Western financial systems and trigger retaliatory seizures of European holdings in Russia.The EU's move would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. Historical seizures (Iran  Venezuela) set a contentious precedent  with Russia accusing the West of a ""genetic urge to steal.""If Russia reclaims assets via international courts  Euroclear and Western financial institutions could face chaos. Ukraine's looming default and Washington's hesitation highlight strategic fragility  with long-term damage to trust in the euro and Western monetary systems.The European Union's plan to repurpose €200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine has escalated into a high-stakes legal and financial battle  with Moscow retaliating by suing Euroclear for $230 billion in damages.Euroclear is a Brussels-based financial depository that holds and manages seized Russian assets in European banks  according to BrightU.AI's Enoch.The move  framed by Russia as outright ""theft "" risks destabilizing Western financial institutions and undermining international trust in the euro. Meanwhile  the U.S. has reportedly warned the EU against confiscating the funds  fearing it could sabotage peace negotiations with Moscow.Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine  Western nations froze approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets  with €210 billion held in Europe—primarily by Euroclear. EU leaders  led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  have proposed using these funds to back a ""reparations loan"" for Ukraine  arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on.However  the plan has met fierce resistance—not just from Russia but also within the EU itself. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the measure  forcing Brussels to invoke emergency powers to keep the assets frozen indefinitely. Belgium  home to Euroclear  has expressed concerns about being left vulnerable to Russian lawsuits. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that Washington has privately urged Brussels to ""leave these Russian assets alone "" fearing Moscow would harden its stance in peace talks.Russia's legal counterattackRussia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive  with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor  which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow  such as China  Hong Kong or the UAE  where Euroclear operates.Kirill Dmitriev  Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy  warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: ""What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear  in euro or in the EU  if they understand that their property rights are not respected?""Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further  accusing the West of a ""genetic urge to steal "" citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia  potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war.Historical precedent and financial falloutThe EU's move marks an unprecedented step in modern financial warfare. A 2024 study by Sweden's Riksbank noted that this would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent country's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party.The U.S. has floated an alternative proposal—splitting the frozen funds between Ukrainian reconstruction and a U.S.-Russia investment vehicle—but Brussels appears determined to proceed. However  Ukraine's worsening financial crisis complicates matters. Reuters recently reported that Kyiv is nearing default on $20 billion in debt to investors like BlackRock  raising doubts about its ability to repay any new loans—even those backed by Russian assets.The EU's gamble on Russian assets risks backfiring spectacularly. If Moscow succeeds in reclaiming its funds through international courts  Western financial institutions could face chaos  with Euroclear at the center of the storm. Meanwhile  Ukraine's economic collapse and Washington's hesitation underscore the fragility of the West's strategy. As legal battles loom and diplomatic tensions flare  one thing is clear: The financial fallout from this confrontation could reshape global trust in Western monetary systems for years to come.Belgium blocks the EU's plan to seize Russian assets.

54375,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629589-eu-struggling-plan-steal-russian-assets/,EU leaders fail to agree on stealing Russian assets for Ukraine: As it happened — RT World News,The EU is expected to vote on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine Read Full Article at RT.com,Moscow has condemned all proposals to use its sovereign funds to support Ukraine as “theft” and warned of legal retaliationEU leaders have failed to back a controversial plan to steal sovereign Russian assets to finance Ukraine's economy and military.Following a divisive 16-hour summit in Brussels on Thursday  no backing was secured for the plan which Moscow has denounced as outright theft and warned would trigger legal retaliation.The bloc's leaders were locked into talks that went into the night  after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen demanded that nobody be allowed to leave until financing for Ukraine has been secured. Ukraine faces an estimated $160 billion fiscal shortfall over the next two years.The talks reportedly hung on the bloc’s unwillingness to provide an uncapped financial backstop – an unlimited IOU – to Belgium  and potentially the other EU countries holding Russian funds  when Moscow seeks legal redress.Bloc members have long debated tapping Russian central bank funds estimated at around €210 billion ($246 billion) as part of a ‘reparations loan’ to Kiev (to understand why that is a misnomer and part of EU spin  read here) which it will have to repay only if Russia agrees to pay war damages.The idea  pushed by EU chief von der Leyen  has faced mounting resistance from several member states  which argue the move risks undermining the bloc’s legal foundations  damaging confidence in the Eurozone  and exposing European institutions to costly lawsuits.Belgium  where most of the assets are held via the Euroclear settlement system  has been a particularly vehement critic of the plan  demanding that legal risks be shared among other EU members.Disagreements have been so intense that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday that the Russian assets issue “will not be on the table” at all during the leaders’ meeting. The official agenda also does not explicitly mention Russian assets  saying only that EU leaders “will discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and issues that require urgent EU action.”EU sanctions normally require unanimous approval  giving any single member state a veto. To avoid that  the bloc last week invoked controversial emergency legislation – already the subject of a legal challenge by the European Parliament – to lock the assets in place temporarily  arguing that any subsequent steps can be approved separately by a qualified majority of 55% member states representing at least 65% of the EU’s population.Moscow has warned that any attempts to seize its assets will constitute “theft” and violate international law  adding that the move would trigger retaliatory measures and legal action.This live feed has ended.,negative,0.0,0.38,0.61,negative,0.0,0.25,0.75,True,English,"['RT World News', 'EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'EU chief von der Leyen', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Russian central bank funds', 'divisive 16-hour summit', '$160 billion fiscal shortfall', 'next two years', 'uncapped financial backstop', 'Euroclear settlement system', 'single member state', 'other EU countries', 'controversial emergency legislation', 'several member states', 'other EU members', 'urgent EU action', 'Russian assets issue', 'European institutions', 'European Parliament', 'Russian funds', '55% member states', 'EU spin', 'EU sanctions', 'legal action', 'EU leaders', 'sovereign funds', 'legal retaliation', 'unlimited IOU', 'legal redress', 'reparations loan', 'war damages', 'mounting resistance', 'legal foundations', 'vehement critic', 'legal risks', 'official agenda', 'latest developments', 'unanimous approval', 'legal challenge', 'subsequent steps', 'qualified majority', 'international law', 'retaliatory measures', 'live feed', 'controversial plan', 'leaders’ meeting', 'Bloc members', 'outright theft', 'Moscow', 'proposals', 'Ukraine', 'economy', 'military', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'backing', 'talks', 'night', 'financing', 'unwillingness', 'Belgium', 'part', 'Kiev', 'misnomer', 'idea', 'move', 'confidence', 'Eurozone', 'lawsuits', 'Disagreements', 'Wednesday', 'table', 'issues', 'veto', 'subject', 'place', 'population', 'attempts']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,rt.com

The frozen Russian funds are seen by Washington as a “crucial part of Trump’s proposed settlement plan ” it wrote on Wednesday.Trump has proposed that Russia’s assets be unfrozen and invested in US-led reconstruction efforts in Ukraine  as well as joint projects with Moscow  according to an early draft published by the media last month.While not commenting on Trump’s plan regarding Russian assets  officials in Moscow said the US-backed peace talks have been continually obstructed by Kiev’s European sponsors.Western Europe is attempting to “scheme against the US” and maintain its proxy war in Ukraine  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week.To bypass the need for unanimous approval  the EU invoked controversial emergency legislation last week to lock the assets in place temporarily  arguing that any subsequent steps can be approved separately by a qualified majority of 15 out of 27 member states representing at least 65% of the EU’s population.In response  the Russian central bank filed lawsuits against Belgian-based Euroclear  where most of the funds are held  as well as several European banks.,neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'hands', 'media', 'Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'Russian central bank assets', 'US President Donald Trump', 'US-led reconstruction efforts', 'US-backed peace talks', 'controversial emergency legislation', 'several European banks', 'frozen Russian funds', 'Ukraine peace plan', 'Russian assets', 'European sponsors', 'US administration', 'US discussions', 'key role', 'The Times', 'reparations loan', 'legal risks', 'bloc members', 'Czech Republic', 'crucial part', 'settlement plan', 'joint projects', 'early draft', 'Western Europe', 'proxy war', 'unanimous approval', 'subsequent steps', 'qualified majority', '27 member states', 'Belgian-based Euroclear', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU leaders', 'EU nations', 'insistence', 'way', 'attempts', 'Politico', 'officials', 'Washington', 'Brussels', 'Thursday', 'Kiev', 'move', 'Moscow', 'Belgium', 'problem', 'Wednesday', 'capitals', 'Italy', 'Bulgaria', 'Malta', 'group', 'grab', 'outlet', 'money', 'Europeans', 'source', 'close', 'media', 'need', 'place', 'population', 'response', 'lawsuits']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,rt.com

The bloc’s leaders hope to clinch the plan at a summit this week. Moscow has condemned any use of its immobilized funds as “theft.”The draft would steer up to €210 billion ($246 billion) over the next five years to defense suppliers based in the EU and Ukraine  with a limited carve-out for non-EU members such as Norway. Brussels is reportedly seeking to ensure that any boost to Ukraine’s military capacity directly supports the bloc’s own defense industry  the outlet said on Wednesday  citing a proposal circulated to member states this week.Participation by non-EU countries would be tightly capped and regulated  a condition that would sharply limit Kiev’s ability to use the loan to buy US-made weapons  the outlet said  citing the proposal.Earlier this year  US President Donald Trump rolled out a new Ukraine arms-supply scheme under which Washington sells weapons sought by Kiev to NATO members  who then deliver them to the country.In November  Trump said the US was no longer “spending” money on Ukraine and was instead taking in funds through weapons sales to NATO countries.The reported proposal would also give the European Commission the power to require European defense manufacturers to prioritize orders for Ukraine and to impose penalties for non-compliance.Last week  the EU member states voted on the latest temporary freeze on Russian sovereign funds. The bloc’s leadership had to invoke emergency powers to overcome the opposition of member states  including Hungary and Slovakia.The initiative has faced mounting resistance from several member states  who argue the move risks undermining the bloc’s legal foundations  damaging confidence in the Eurozone and exposing European institutions to costly lawsuits.Russia has steadfastly opposed EU moves to “steal” the funds  warning of economic and legal consequences.Last week  the Bank of Russia filed a lawsuit seeking $230 billion in compensation from Euroclear.

Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/APThe European Union is searching for a way to finance Ukraine’s defence and budget needs in ​2026 and 2027 with Russian central bank assets immobilised in the West after Moscow’s invasion.Under international law  sovereign assets cannot be confiscated  so the European Commission has put forward a plan to allow EU governments to use up to €165 billion – most of the €210 billion worth of Russian sovereign assets currently frozen in Europe – without confiscating them.How would it work?At the outset of Russia’s war in Ukraine  Euroclear – the Belgian Central Securities Depository – was holding bonds for the Russian central bank. ‍As these bonds have matured  the resulting cash has become stuck in Euroclear because of EU sanctions against Moscow.The EU’s idea is for Euroclear to instead invest in zero-coupon bonds issued by the European Commission. The bond coupon can be zero because under the legal arrangement Euroclear has with the Russian central bank  Moscow retains ownership of the capital  but does not have the right to the interest generated by the assets.The EU ‌would then use the cash to issue a “reparations loan” to Ukraine  in tranches  according to needs.The loan would only be repaid by Ukraine once it receives war reparations from Russia in a peace agreement  effectively allowing Ukraine to spend the money now  rather ⁠than wait until Moscow pays.How much money is available?Some $300 billion (€257 billion) of Russian sovereign assets are frozen globally  according to various institutions  including the European Commission. This number does ‌not ​include any ‍frozen assets of Russian oligarchs.Of that  €210 billion are held in Europe  of which €185 billion are with Euroclear.The EU initially wanted to base the reparations loan only on the money in Euroclear  but Belgium insists that the remaining €25 billion in Russian sovereign assets frozen elsewhere ⁠in the EU should also be included.[ The €90bn question: will Belgium sign up to frozen assets plan for Ukraine?Opens in new window ]Most of that €25 billion is held in French banks  EU officials said. This complicates the project because  unlike the money in Euroclear  the assets generate ⁠interest that belongs to Russia.Under the Commission plan  the EU would use €90 billion of the frozen assets to disburse to Ukraine in tranches over 2026 and 2027. This amount could be increased  if needed  since there would be money left.The Commission estimates Ukraine’s financing needs over the two years at €136 billion and expects countries outside the EU to contribute the remaining money.How would this be done without confiscating the cash?Russia would retain the claim on its cash in Euroclear and elsewhere. The Russian cash would simply be replaced with EU bonds of the same value on the balance sheet of the institutions holding it through a compulsory transaction with the EU.Who carries the financial risk?EU countries have to ‌share the risk of the whole project. The main risk is a scenario under which the EU has to return the cash to Russia but Russia has not yet paid the war reparations to Ukraine  therefore leaving the EU liable for the amount that has been transferred to Ukraine.[ Russia accused of intimidating Belgian leaders to block use of frozen assets for UkraineOpens in new window ]EU governments agreed on December 12th that the immobilised Russian assets will ‌stay frozen indefinitely  removing a serious risk that during one of the votes that take place every six months to keep the money frozen  which requires unanimity  one country could break ranks with others and force the EU to release the money ⁠to Moscow.What has Russia said?The Kremlin has described the proposal as an illegal seizure of Russian property and cautioned there would be retaliation for the theft of Russian assets. – Reuters,neutral,0.0,0.97,0.03,negative,0.0,0.3,0.7,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'EU', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Central Securities Depository', 'Belgian financial clearing house', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'The European Union', 'frozen assets plan', 'Belgian leaders', 'Russian assets', 'financial risk', 'Russian oligarchs', 'Russian property', '\u200dfrozen assets', 'The Commission', 'The Kremlin', 'European Commission', 'vast majority', 'international law', '€210 billion worth', 'bond coupon', 'legal arrangement', 'peace agreement', '€90bn question', 'new window', 'French banks', 'Commission plan', 'two years', 'same value', 'balance sheet', 'compulsory transaction', 'December 12th', 'one country', 'illegal seizure', 'Russian cash', 'main risk', 'serious risk', 'reparations loan', 'war reparations', 'budget needs', 'zero-coupon bonds', 'various institutions', 'EU governments', 'EU sanctions', 'EU officials', 'resulting cash', 'remaining money', 'EU bonds', 'EU countries', 'Billions', 'Euroclear', 'Photograph', 'way', 'Ukraine', 'defence', 'West', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'outset', 'idea', 'ownership', 'capital', 'right', 'interest', 'tranches', 'number', 'Belgium', 'project', 'amount', 'financing', 'claim', 'scenario', 'votes', 'place', 'unanimity', 'ranks', 'others', 'proposal', 'retaliation', 'theft', 'Reuters']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,irishtimes.com
54379,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629570-eu-russian-sovereign-assets/,Either way the EU loses: Why ignoring the US on Russian assets will be the bloc’s undoing,The EU is going to lose whichever way its members vote on a controversial plan to steal Russian assets Read Full Article at RT.com,A controversial vote under dubious legal circumstances is set to herald a new era in which Brussels destroys its own reputationIt is crunch time for Ursula von der Leyen and her Brussels-based cabal who have attempted to bend and break EU law in order to force through a dubious legal claim for the use of sovereign Russian wealth to further fund Ukraine’s military. Kiev is long past broke  owes the EU some €45 billion and faces a fiscal shortage of €70 billion for the next year  and is suffering a slow and painful frontline collapse.Moscow has long described the EU’s attack on its assets as “theft ” the IMF and European Central Bank both oppose the move  and the ratings agency Fitch has already issued a downgrade warning to Euroclear  the clearing house at centre of the scandal.The stakesVon der Leyen  along with her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  have managed to bring what is widely regarded as a potentially disastrous initiative to an EU vote under dubious circumstances which  if it fails  will leave the two German politicians’ reputations in ruins.Merz has been at the megaphone this week while von der Leyen has pressed the flesh with bloc members. In the past 48 hours  the former chairman of the Blackrock Germany board has declared the ‘pax Americana’ is over  compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler (Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi)  and warned of direct NATO-Russia conflict.However  it could be worse. If the vote to use Russian assets to finance Kiev’s military is passed  it will permanently damage the EU’s reputation  spell the end of any Russia-EU cooperation for decades while triggering a global legal onslaught.A slew of cases will be opened in the bloc  not least by Belgium  which has protested against the EU attempts to get its hands on some €180 billion of Russian sovereign wealth held in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.Russia has also begun legal proceedings in a Moscow arbitration court for damages. Some €280 billion of assets belonging to countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow  presently held in type-C deposits in Russia  could be seized in retaliation for the European attack on Russia’s funds  as well as a wave of litigation potentially targeting all complicit institutions in every major global financial hub.Death and “pax Americana”The European option also ignores the military reality in Donbass and Ukraine  by seeking to pour billions into continuing a war that Kiev is undoubtedly losing. US President Donald Trump’s team  however  have proposed a different mechanism which Russia has not outright rejected  by which the Russian funds in question are used for an investment vehicle. Such a mechanism could have a very positive impact on the investment climate in a post-conflict Ukraine  given the rampant and endemic corruption associated with the country and in particular Vladimir Zelensky’s inner circle.Effectively what we are witnessing is the European Union rejecting Washington while trying to force on Kiev a militaristic future which only promises years of warfare. The US  which let us remember initiated this entire round of diplomacy  has a proposal on the table that could secure a stable and lasting peace  offer security guarantees to all parties involved  and have a positive impact on the investment climate in a country that will need unprecedented investment.The SpinWhile you may have read that the European Union has already taken an indefinite hold over Russia’s assets in lieu of reparations to Ukraine  neither of these claims is true.The EU has misused article 122 of its constitution to assert a temporary hold over Russian assets for as long as they can prove that the conflict in Ukraine poses or threatens to pose an economic risk to the bloc. There is no indefinite freeze on Russian assets for reparations to speak of.Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has spoken of the EU “stealing” Russian assets. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Rueben has already described the EU tactics as “a declaration of war.” Slovakia’s Robert Fico  who was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist  has claimed Brussels is only “prolonging the war.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has also refused to support financing Ukraine.Italy  Malta  and others are also said to be firmly against the plot to steal Russia’s assets and are advocating for a different option.The voteThough the matter is regarded as a foreign policy issue involving the assets of a non-member of the bloc and would normally require unanimity to pass  von der Leyen has managed force a vote under qualified majority voting.This means that 15 of the 27 member states  and/or states representing 65% of the EU’s population must vote in favor in order to pass the ruling. Eight votes against could be enough to force von der Leyen to have to go back to EU taxpayers  already suffering and drifting to the left and right  to seek lining for Ukraine’s donated war chest.Should the reparations loan option be defeated or removed from the table  the joint debt option  whereby EU member countries must borrow money for Ukraine  to be repaid by the countries themselves  will arise  requiring unanimity to pass.Either way  it looks like Brussels could lose.,negative,0.0,0.4,0.6,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'bloc', 'undoing', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Rueben', 'Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis', 'compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'major global financial hub', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'stakes Von der Leyen', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'two German politicians', 'Belgian clearing house', 'global legal onslaught', 'painful frontline collapse', 'ratings agency Fitch', 'Blackrock Germany board', 'foreign policy issue', 'qualified majority voting', 'joint debt option', 'sovereign Russian wealth', 'Russian sovereign wealth', 'dubious legal claim', 'European Central Bank', 'direct NATO-Russia conflict', 'dubious legal circumstances', 'Moscow arbitration court', 'reparations loan option', 'The European option', 'EU member countries', 'dubious circumstances', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'The US', 'legal proceedings', 'different option', 'European Union', 'new era', 'crunch time', 'Brussels-based cabal', 'fiscal shortage', 'next year', 'downgrade warning', 'disastrous initiative', 'past 48 hours', 'former chairman', 'Adolf Hitler', 'Russia-EU cooperation', 'type-C deposits', 'complicit institutions', 'Russian funds', 'investment vehicle', 'positive impact', 'investment climate', 'endemic corruption', 'inner circle', 'militaristic future', 'entire round', 'lasting peace', 'security guarantees', 'unprecedented investment', 'The Spin', 'indefinite hold', 'temporary hold', 'economic risk', 'indefinite freeze', 'Robert Fico', 'close range', 'pro-Ukraine activist', 'Eight votes', 'Russian assets', 'European attack', 'EU law', 'EU attempts', 'EU tactics', 'EU taxpayers', 'pax Americana', 'different mechanism', '27 member states', 'controversial vote', 'military reality', 'bloc members', 'war chest', 'post-conflict Ukraine', 'EU vote', 'reputation', 'order', 'Kiev', 'slow', 'IMF', 'move', 'Euroclear', 'centre', 'scandal', 'ruins', 'megaphone', 'flesh', 'grandfather', 'Nazi', 'decades', 'slew', 'cases', 'Belgium', 'hands', 'damages', 'retaliation', 'wave', 'litigation', 'Death', 'Donbass', 'billions', 'team', 'question', 'rampant', 'country', 'Washington', 'years', 'warfare', 'diplomacy', 'proposal', 'table', 'parties', 'lieu', 'claims', 'article', 'constitution', 'declaration', 'Slovakia', 'financing', 'Italy', 'Malta', 'others', 'plot', 'matter', 'unanimity', 'population', 'favor', 'ruling', 'left', 'right', 'lining', '€']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,rt.com

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)By LORNE COOK  SAM McNEIL and ANGELA CHARLTONEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years  but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.After almost four years of war  the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need 137 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy  and desperately needs the money by spring.The plan had been to use some of the 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian assets that are frozen in Europe  mostly in Belgium.The leaders worked deep into Thursday night to reassure Belgium that they would protect it from any Russian retaliation if it backed the “reparations loan” plan but in the end the leaders did not use that option  but as the talks bogged down the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.“We have a deal. Decision to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) of support to Ukraine for 2026-27 approved. We committed  we delivered ” EU Council President António Costa said in a post on social media.Not all countries agreed to the loan package. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic refuse to support Ukraine and opposed it  but a deal was reached in which they did not block the package and were promised protection from any financial fallout.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  who is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europea and describes himself as a peacemaker  said “I would not like a European Union in war.”“To give money means war.” said Orbán. He also described the rejected plan to use the frozen Russian assets as a “dead end.”French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was a major advance  saying that borrowing on capital markets “was the most realistic and practical way” to fund Ukraine and its war efforts.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the decision.“The financial package for Ukraine has been finalized ” Merz said in a statement  noting that “Ukraine is granted a zero-interest loan.""“These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come ” Merz added. He said the frozen assets will remain blocked until Russia has paid war reparations to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that would cost over 600 billion euros ($700 billion).“If Russia does not pay reparations we will — in full accordance with international law — make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan ” Merz said.Zelenskyy  who traveled to Brussels for a summit that took place during fiery protests by farmers angry about a proposed trade deal with five South American countries  had appealed for a quick decision to keep Ukraine afloat in the new year.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned early on Thursday that it would be a case of sending “either money today or blood tomorrow” to help Ukraine.The plan to use frozen Russian assets got bogged down as Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever rejected the scheme as legally risky  and warned that it could harm the business of Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial clearing house where 193 billion euros ($226 billion) in frozen assets are held.Belgium was rattled last Friday when Russia’s Central Bank launched a lawsuit against Euroclear to prevent any loan being provided to Ukraine using its money  which is frozen under EU sanctions slapped on Moscow after its launched its full-scale war in 2022.“For me  the reparations loan was not a good idea "" De Wever told reporters after the meeting. “When we explained the text again  there were so many questions that I said  I told you so  I told you so. There are a lot of loose ends. And if you start pulling at the loose ends in the strings  the thing collapses.”“We avoided stepping into a precedent that risks undermining legal certainty worldwide. We safeguarded the principle that Europe respects law  even when it is hard  even when we are under pressure ” he said  adding that the EU ""delivered a strong political signal. Europe stands behind Ukraine.""Still  Costa said that the EU ""reserves its right to make use of the immobilized assets to repay this loan.”© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert  File)BRUSSELS -- For decades  Belgium has been at the beating heart of the European Union. The headquarters of the 27-nation bloc’s main institutions and NATO are based there. EU leaders meet in the capital Brussels at least four times a year.But at Thursday’s EU summit of presidents and government leaders  Belgium and its prime minister were at the heart of political tensions that could send ripples across the world’s biggest trading bloc for years to come.The tensions arise from a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s military and economic needs for the next two years. Most of that money is blocked at Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial clearinghouse.Belgium fears that Russia will strike back; in the courts or perhaps by other means.Prime Minister Bart De Wever — whose political ambition before taking office in February was to break up Belgium  gut its state structures and grant more autonomy to his northern Flanders region — wants Europe to unite around his concerns.The reparations loan plan  De Wever told Belgian lawmakers on Thursday  “drastically increases the risk of Russian retaliation. It’s not acceptable that this happens to Belgium alone. If we jump  we jump together.”The money blocked at Euroclear — 193 billion euros ($226 billion) as of September — equals almost a third of the kingdom’s gross domestic product. Belgium is mired in debt  among the worst financial performers in the EU.For months  De Wever struggled to chaperone his five-party coalition into agreeing on a budget. Those torturous negotiations only ended recently  making it tricky for him to agree on a loan to Ukraine that might hurt Belgium’s finances.As the “reparations loan” plan was being devised  his government regularly highlighted its vulnerability to retaliation.After EU leaders last debated the assets in October  Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said that a series of drone incidents at Belgium's airports and military bases appeared to be “a spying operation” aimed at “destabilizing” people. The culprits were never identified.Ahead of Thursday’s summit  Belgian officials underlined how the Russian Central Bank last Friday had sued Euroclear for more money than the clearinghouse is actually holding  and warned that more could come.Some EU nations believe that De Wever has been too vocal about his opposition to the loans and backed himself into a corner that he will struggle to escape from without embarrassment at home.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he understands “the risks that he is talking about  but I think that we face bigger risks.” He added that “Ukraine has the right to this money because Russia is destroying us.”With Belgium standing firm  the question for its EU partners is whether to simply forge ahead without De Wever’s consent. Ukraine needs the money early next year  and even Belgium agrees that the EU must find the funds soon.At least nine countries would have to object to prevent the loans and no blocking minority has yet emerged.But running roughshod over Belgium  particularly over a founding EU member country with much at stake  could undermine EU decision-making. Majorities would surely be harder to form in the future and other countries might be more inclined to use their vetoes.“Let us not deceive ourselves. If we do not succeed in this  the European Union’s ability to act will be severely damaged for years  if not for a longer period ” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said of the loan plan on Monday.The question for De Wever is whether the legal and financial costs Belgium could suffer would outweigh the costs of undermining his country’s credibility with his European partners  and with Ukraine.Whatever path is taken  summit chairman EU Council President António Costa has vowed to keep leaders negotiating until a funding deal is clinched  even if it takes days. It seems within De Wever’s power to achieve that before he turns 55 on Sunday.,neutral,0.01,0.78,0.22,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['tight rope', 'EU partners', 'pressure', 'home', 'Belgium', 'leader', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Prime Minister Robert Fico', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'founding EU member country', 'round table meeting', 'Geert Vanden Wijngaert', 'northern Flanders region', 'gross domestic product', 'worst financial performers', 'Russian Central Bank', 'biggest trading bloc', 'next two years', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Brussels-based financial clearinghouse', 'reparations loan plan', 'reparations loan” plan', 'Belgium standing firm', 'Belgian lawmakers', 'Belgian officials', '27-nation bloc', 'Russian retaliation', 'financial costs', 'European Union', 'tight rope', 'EU partners', 'AP Photo', 'main institutions', 'EU leaders', 'economic needs', 'other means', 'political ambition', 'state structures', '193 billion euros', 'five-party coalition', 'torturous negotiations', 'drone incidents', 'spying operation', 'EU nations', 'Ukrainian President', 'Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'nine countries', 'blocking minority', 'EU decision-making', 'other countries', 'longer period', 'European partners', 'EU summit', 'summit chair', 'government leaders', 'political tensions', 'military bases', 'bigger risks', 'beating heart', 'capital Brussels', 'pressure', 'home', 'funds', 'Ukraine', 'FILE', 'left', 'Germany', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Thursday', 'decades', 'headquarters', 'NATO', 'presidents', 'ripples', 'world', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'courts', 'office', 'February', 'autonomy', 'concerns', 'September', 'third', 'kingdom', 'debt', 'months', 'budget', 'finances', 'vulnerability', 'October', 'series', 'airports', 'people', 'culprits', 'opposition', 'loans', 'corner', 'embarrassment', 'right', 'question', 'consent', 'stake', 'Majorities', 'future', 'vetoes', 'Monday', 'legal', 'credibility', 'path']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,abcnews.go.com

But most of the frozen assets are held by the Belgian bank Euroclear  and Belgium has repeatedly raised concerns about the plan.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'high-stakes summit', 'Ukraine reparations', 'loan', 'agenda', 'next multiannual financial framework', 'high-stakes European Council summit', 'next long-term budget', 'next plenary session', 'Belgian bank Euroclear', 'January plenary session', '27 EU member states', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian state assets', 'high-stakes summit', 'financial support', 'frozen assets', 'European defense', 'European Commission', 'European Parliament', 'two days', 'strategic discussions', 'geo-economic situation', 'Middle East', 'security guarantees', 'diplomatic efforts', 'external economic', 'political pressures', 'strategic autonomy', 'draft legislation', 'cash balances', 'final approval', 'EU heads', 'controversial proposal', 'trade agenda', 'reparations loan', 'Ukraine reparations', 'EU leaders', 'BRUSSELS', 'enlargement', 'bloc', 'developments', 'migration', 'peace', 'stock', 'progress', 'competitiveness', 'way', 'Tuesday', 'vote', 'funds', 'profits', 'decision', 'position', 'Jan.', 'negotiations', 'government', 'Belgium', 'concerns', 'plan']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,hurriyetdailynews.com

At the moment his opinion could be worth about €90 billion to Ukraine.The hard-right Flemish nationalist is withholding his support for a plan to use a large pile of sanctioned Russian state cash  frozen inside financial institutions in Europe  to finance a lifeline loan to Ukraine.The leaders of the European Union’s 27 states will walk into a room on Thursday morning for a Brussels summit that may go on for as long as it takes to come out holding a deal.Without a significant package of financial aid from Europe  Ukraine is expected to start running out of money in the spring. Nobody is banking on Vladimir Putin compromising for peace.Nearly all of the frozen Russian assets are in Euroclear  a Belgian institution that minds government bonds. So everyone’s eyes are on De Wever  who would need to lift his opposition to using sanctioned cash to back up a loan  to finance Ukraine’s efforts on the battlefield for the next two years.The money would be paid back to Russia if Moscow ever agrees to compensate Ukraine for the destruction caused by its invasion and the four years of war that followed.Belgium is afraid the plan will leave it exposed to all kinds of possible retaliation from Russia and damage its reputation as a safe place to put your money.A huge amount of technical and legal work has gone into addressing Belgium’s concerns.Those who know much more than I do insist significant changes have been made. EU states would jointly take over nearly all foreseeable risks  so that Belgium is not left carrying the can from any fallout on its own. This has not shifted De Wever.Belgium wants everyone to go farther and is seeking a blanket guarantee of unlimited value to cover all possible risks.The loan only needs a big majority of EU leaders behind it  rather than unanimous approval. That gets around Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly leader Viktor Orban  who will block any aid to Ukraine.Politically though  it would be almost impossible for the rest of the leaders to move ahead without Belgium’s tacit approval.To throw this into a bit of context  imagine France  Germany and the rest of the EU had decided to cut a different type of Brexit deal with the UK  over the objections of Ireland.Taking decisions by consensus has traditionally avoided situations where the genuine and sensitive national interests of one member state can be trampled by the rest.“I think all the leaders are very much aware of the disproportionate stakes of Belgium in a reparations loan solution. That is being taken into account ” said one senior EU official involved in negotiations.In a speech on the eve of the summit  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Europe was facing a world of wars and predators. “We Europeans must defend ourselves and we must depend on ourselves ” she said.A lot has been bet on the Russian assets loan.Some clarity on the figures  because there is a fair amount of euros and zeros flying about. In total there is €210 billion worth of Russian state assets frozen inside the EU by the bloc’s sanctions targeting Moscow.The vast majority of that  about €185 billion  is held in the Belgian securities depository Euroclear. A further €25 billion is spread across banks in several other EU states.Governments will have to voluntarily provide financial guarantees to backstop that total amount  to cough up the money in the unlikely scenario where early repayment to Russia is triggered.It is clear that if Belgium is going to come around to back the plan  it will only happen after hours – or maybe days – of negotiations between leaders.Other options to shore up Ukraine’s finances are no easier.Plan B envisages the EU borrowing money on the financial markets  which member states would jointly pay back over time  to provide a loan to Kyiv.Common borrowing would need the sign-off of all 27 leaders. Orban and Slovakia’s populist prime minister Robert Fico would almost certainly refuse. Officials say the idea for a joint EU loan has been taken off the table and put back up on the shelf.De Wever is expected to ask leaders to consider using emergency powers to overrule Orban’s veto to back the common EU loan option.A lot of national governments’ budgets are already pretty stretched. Maybe leaders (minus Orban and Fico) could rustle up €10 billion or €20 billion  by borrowing money individually to hand to Ukraine. That would be far short of what it needs and probably just buy a bit of time.The meeting of leaders  known as the European Council  is where the big political decisions are supposed to be taken.Emerging from the summit empty-handed would do grave damage to the EU’s standing in the shifting world order  where Brussels is increasingly fighting for relevance with Washington  Beijing and Moscow.

This was about Europe as well as Ukraine  he said.As the war approaches its fifth anniversary  and peace talks continue involving US  Ukrainian and Russian officials  the EU is increasingly framing discussions in terms of its own security.If Russia prevails in Ukraine  then the European Union itself would be at risk.There are officially two options on the table: borrowing tens of billions of euro against the EU budget  or converting up to €210bn of frozen Russian assets  the bulk of which are currently held in a Belgian securities depository.But it's the latter option which most member states  including Ireland  prefer.Watch: Taoiseach says Ireland is in favour of using frozen Russian assets to support UkraineTaoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland is ""very much in favour"" of using the immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine financially and militarily in the coming years.""There has to be a deterrence against countries violating the UN Charter  undermining the sovereignty of other nations  and then destroying those countries their civilian infrastructure  their energy infrastructure  without any need then to rebuild "" he told RTÉ News.""There is an important deterrence issue here that countries cannot simply destroy another country and expect others to pay for all of the reconstruction of that country.""Read More:How does the EU want to use Russia's frozen assets for Ukraine?Latest Ukraine storiesBut Belgium remains fearful that a successful Russian legal claim could leave the country on the hook. It wants legally binding and enforceable guarantees that other capitals will share the risk especially those which also hold immobilised Russian assets.There have been intense discussions between Belgium and the European Commission on what guarantees will look like and how open ended they might be.Mr Zelensky said that any failure by EU leaders to agree on a plan would be a serious challenge for his country.""I will speak with all the leaders  present our arguments  and I very much hope we can obtain a positive decision. Without it  there will be a big problem for Ukraine "" Mr Zelensky told reporters  ahead of his visit to Brussels.In October  EU leaders - with the exception of Hungary - pledged to find ways to fund the country for the next two years  both for its own survival and to show Russia that Europe continues to support the country.However  since the vast bulk of Russia's frozen those assets are held in a Belgian company called Euroclear  the Belgian government has objected  fearing a potential legal claim by Russia.The European Commission has insisted that no Russian or international arbitration court can hold Belgium liable so long as the assets are subject to EU sanctions.Last week  the EU used emergency powers to ensure those sanctions are locked in until Russia starts to pay reparations  so that Hungary cannot veto them.Belgium says it wants full mutualisation of the risk. Prime Minister Bart de Wever has also said leaders should consider using so-called headroom in the EU budget against which joint debt could be raised.However  that appears to be a non-starter  as it would require unanimity  and Hungary would almost certainly block such a move.Mr De Wever told Belgian MPs this morning that guarantees offered by the EU are so far ""insufficient"".""Belgium will not accept a solution where we are the only one bearing both the risks and the responsibility "" Mr De Wever said.""I have not seen a text that could persuade me to give Belgium's agreement. I haven't seen it yet; I hope to see it today  but I haven't seen it yet "" he said.Speaking as he arrived for the summit  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the idea of using Russian frozen assets to finance Ukraine  is ""dead"" as there is a blocking minority against it.Officials say agreement on using Russian assets would send a signal to the Trump administration and Russia that Europe is serious about supporting Ukraine in its hour of need.The European Council will also discuss the Middle East  as well as EU enlargement  security and defence and combatting antisemitism.The EU's next multi-annual budget (2028-2034)  competitiveness and migration are also expected to be discussed.Ahead of the meeting with EU leaders  Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he looked forward to hearing from Mr Zelensky  who met Mr Martin in Dublin earlier in December.""I fully support plans to use frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine  and I hope it will be possible for the meeting to reach an agreement on that "" he said.""I will also be arguing strongly in favour of accelerating Ukraine's EU application. Membership of the EU for Ukraine is also important for its future security.""Our meeting is an opportunity to send a clear message that EU enlargement will happen  and that the reform efforts by countries aspiring to join our union will be matched by our ambition to advance their path towards EU membership.Taoiseach Micheál Martin and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen attended the EU Western Balkans Summit in Brussels yesterday""There are malign actors  including Russia  who are seeking to destabilise the EU and our neighbours  attacking our shared values and posing a real threat to our security.""Referencing sightings of drones near Dublin as Mr Zelensky arrived in Ireland  Mr Martin added  ""As recent events have shown  Ireland is not immune to these threats and we must continue to work with our EU partners to combat them.""The Taoiseach also said he would highlight the ""critical"" humanitarian crisis facing people in Gaza.""Two months into the ceasefire  aid has still not reached the levels required and as agreed in the peace plan "" he said.""I will be stressing the need for the EU to do all it can to get this much-needed assistance to the people of Gaza  especially as winter closes in  and to contribute to the next phase of the peace plan  which supports a two-state solution "" he added.Addressing Sunday's Bondi Beach attack  he also said he welcomed that the European Council will look to ""intensify efforts to rid our societies of the scourge of anti-Semitism"".""We were all deeply shocked and appalled by the terrorist attack on the Jewish community in Sydney "" he said.""There can be no place for anti-Semitism and hatred in our societies "" he added.He said he would argue that the EU should be open to trade and invest in innovation  and said Ireland wanted a ""ringfenced and fully funded"" CAP and Common Fisheries Policy.President Zelensky said that Ukrainian and US delegations would hold new talks on Friday and Saturday in the United States aiming to end the Russian invasion.US President Donald Trump has been pushing for a quick deal to end the fighting  and negotiating teams have proposed draft plans to end the war.Trump said a deal was closer than ever after Zelensky  US and European officials agreed on a 20-point plan last week.But Russia has yet to react to the latest proposal and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeated that Moscow intends to pursue its maximalist military aims in Ukraine.""We all know Russia's position.

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)BRUSSELS -- Belgium insisted on Thursday that its European Union partners must provide ironclad guarantees that it will be protected from Russian retaliation before it would back a massive loan for Ukraine.At a high-stakes EU summit in Brussels  the 27-nation bloc’s leaders are set to decide on whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine’s military and financial needs over the next two years.The bulk of the assets — some 193 billion euros ($227 billion) as of September — are held in the Brussels-based financial clearing house Euroclear. Russia’s Central Bank sued Euroclear last week.“Give me a parachute and we’ll all jump together ” Prime Minister Bart De Wever told members of the Belgian parliament just before the summit began. “If we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn’t be a problem.”Belgium fears that Russia will strike back and would prefer that the bloc borrow the money on international markets. It wants frozen assets held in other European countries to be thrown into the pot as well  and for its partners to guarantee that Euroclear will have the funds it needs should it come under legal attack.European officials say Russia is waging a campaign of sabotage and disruption across the continent. The Central Bank lawsuit ramped up pressure on Belgium and its European partners ahead of the summit.The “reparations loan” plan would see the EU give 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine. Countries like the U.K.  Canada and Norway would make up any shortfall.Russia's claim to the assets would still stand  but the assets would remain locked away at least until the Kremlin ends its war on Ukraine and pays for the massive damage it's caused.In mapping out the loan plan  the European Commission set up safeguards to protect Belgium  but De Wever remains unconvinced.“I have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium’s concerns "" he said. ""I hope to see one today.”De Wever insisted that Belgium remains “a faithful ally” of Ukraine and wants to continue to help.Whatever method they use  the leaders have pledged to meet most of Ukraine's needs in 2026 and 2027. The International Monetary Fund estimates that would amount to 137 billion euros ($160 billion). The war-ravaged country is at risk of bankruptcy and needs the money by spring.“We have to find a solution today "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters. EU Council President António Costa  who is chairing the meeting  has vowed to keep leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: “Now we have a simple choice. Either money today or blood tomorrow."" He insisted that ""all European leaders have to rise to the occasion.”EU envoys have worked around the clock in recent weeks to flesh out the details and narrow differences among the 27 member countries. If enough countries object  the plan could be blocked. There is no majority support for a plan B of raising the funds on international markets.“At this stage  it depends on political will ” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Whatsapp chat with reporters while flying to Brussels. “I very much hope that we can obtain a positive decision. Without it  Ukraine will face a major problem.”German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he hopes Belgium's concerns can be addressed.""The reactions of the Russian president in recent hours show how necessary this is. In my view  this is indeed the only option. We are basically faced with the choice of using European debt or Russian assets for Ukraine  and my opinion is clear: we must use the Russian assets.”Hungary and Slovakia oppose von der Leyen’s plan for a reparations loan. Apart from Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy and Malta are also undecided.“I would not like a European Union in war "" said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  who sees himself as a peacemaker. He’s also Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe. “To give money means war.”Orbán described the loan plan as “a dead end ” and said that “the whole idea is a stupid one.”The outcome of the summit has significant ramifications for Europe's place in negotiations to end the war. The United States wants assurances that the Europeans are intent on supporting Ukraine financially and backing it militarily  even as the talks drag on with few results so far.The loan plan in particular also poses important challenges to the way the bloc goes about its business. Should a two-thirds majority of EU leaders decide to impose the scheme on Belgium  which has most to lose  the impact on decision-making in Europe would be profound.Finding voting majorities and avoiding vetoes in the future could become infinitely more complex if one of the EU's founding members is forced to weather an attack on its interests by its very own partners.De Wever too must weigh whether the cost of holding out against a majority is worth the hit his government's credibility would take in Europe.Whatever is decided  the process does not end at this summit. Legal experts would have to convert any political deal into a workable agreement  and some national parliaments may have to weigh in before the loan money could start flowing to Ukraine.___Associated Press Writers Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Illia Novikov in Kyiv contributed to this report.",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,mixed,0.15,0.29,0.56,True,English,"['EU leaders', 'massive loan', 'Ukraine', 'EU Council President António Costa', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house Euroclear', 'Prime Minister Dick Schoof', 'Prime Minister Luc Frieden', 'Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'LORNE COOK Associated Press', 'SAM MCNEIL Associated Press', 'ANGELA CHARLTON Associated Press', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'The Central Bank lawsuit', 'Geert Vanden Wijngaert', 'next two years', 'round table meeting', 'high-stakes EU summit', 'European Union partners', 'other European countries', 'financial needs', 'international markets', 'EU partners', 'EU envoys', 'European officials', 'European partners', 'European Commission', 'ironclad guarantees', 'Russian retaliation', 'AP Photo', 'Belgian parliament', 'legal attack', 'U.K.', 'massive damage', 'faithful ally', 'war-ravaged country', 'simple choice', 'recent weeks', 'narrow differences', '27 member countries', 'enough countries', 'majority support', 'political will', 'Whatsapp chat', 'positive decision', 'massive loan', 'reparations loan', 'European leaders', '27-nation bloc', 'plan B', 'major problem', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', '193 billion euros', '90 billion euros', 'loan plan', '137 billion', 'Belgium', 'Ukraine', 'center', 'left', 'Netherland', 'Luxembourg', 'Poland', 'Thursday', 'tens', 'billions', 'military', 'bulk', 'September', 'parachute', 'members', 'confidence', 'money', 'pot', 'funds', 'campaign', 'sabotage', 'disruption', 'continent', 'pressure', 'Canada', 'Norway', 'shortfall', 'claim', 'Kremlin', 'safeguards', 'text', 'concerns', 'method', 'risk', 'bankruptcy', 'spring', 'solution', 'reporters', 'agreement', 'days', 'blood', 'occasion', 'clock', 'details', 'stage', 'reactions']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,abcnews.go.com
54387,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vjlj1ezpgo,Zelensky gives stark warning as EU leaders decide on Russia's frozen assets,The leaders are to decide whether to loan tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs.,"Zelensky gives stark warning as EU leaders decide on Russia's frozen assets1 day ago Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share SaveJOHN THYS/AFP Ukraine's president has warned Europe's leaders that an agreement has to be reached by the end of the yearVolodymyr Zelensky has called on EU leaders at a crunch summit urgently to agree to a multi-billion euro loan in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs. Ukraine is months from running out of cash and Zelensky said without an injection by spring Ukraine ""will have to reduce production of drones"". Most of Russia's €210bn (£185bn; $245bn) worth of assets in the EU are held by Belgium-based organisation Euroclear. Until now Belgium and some other member states have said they are opposed to using the cash as a ""reparations loan"". Russia has warned EU leaders not to use its money  but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said they had to ""rise to this occasion"".The Brussels summit comes at a pivotal moment in the war and Russia has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in a bid to get its money back. Zelensky said Ukraine was definitely facing a 45-50bn [euro] deficit next year  and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed ""we will not leave the summit without a solution"". One European government official described being ""cautiously optimistic  not overly optimistic"" that a deal would be agreed. All eyes are on Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever  who told the Belgian parliament on Thursday that if everything was nailed down and shared by the rest of the EU  ""then we'll jump into the abyss together with the rest of the Europeans and hope the parachute holds us"".Watch: BBC correspondent explains European divisions on financial support for UkraineMeanwhile  US President Donald Trump has said a deal is closer than ever to end the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. US and Russian officials are due to meet in Miami this weekend for further talks on a peace plan  a White House official has told AFP news agency. It is thought Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev will talk to Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami. Ukrainian officials are also heading to the US  and President Zelensky  who is in Brussels  said Kyiv needed the money  either to support its army if the war continued  or to direct the funding entirely for recovery: ""It's moral  it's fair and it's legal  confirmed by the expertise of many  many professionals."" Russia has not yet responded to the latest peace proposals  but the Kremlin has stressed that plans for a European-led multinational force for Ukraine supported by the US would not be acceptable. President Vladimir Putin made his feelings towards Europe clear on Wednesday  when he said the continent was in a state of ""total degradation"" and that ""European piglets"" - a derogatory description of Ukraine's European allies - were hoping to profit from Russia's collapse.Alexander KAZAKOV/POOL/AFP Those in favour of loaning Ukraine the money believe it will help deter Putin from continuing the warThe European Commission - the EU's executive arm - has proposed loaning Kyiv about €90bn (£79bn) over the next two years - out of the €210bn of Russian assets sitting in Europe. That is about two-thirds of the €137bn that Kyiv is thought to need to get through 2026 and 2027.Until now the EU has handed Ukraine the interest generated by the cash but not the cash itself. ""This is a crunch time for Ukraine to keep fighting for the next year "" a Finnish government official told the BBC. ""There are of course peace negotiations but this gives Ukraine leverage to say 'we're not desperate and we have the funds to continue fighting'."" The head of the European Commission says it will also ramp up the cost of war for Russia. Russia's frozen assets are not the only option on the table for EU leaders. Another idea  backed by Belgium  is based on the EU borrowing the money on the international markets  using the EU budget as a guarantee. However  that would require a unanimous vote and Hungary's Viktor Orban has made it clear he will not allow any more EU money to help Ukraine. For Ukraine  the hours ahead are significant and EU leaders have been keen to stress the momentous nature of the loan decision. ""We know the urgency. It is acute. We all feel it. We all see it "" Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday.EPA Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that two choices were on the table for EU leadersGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has played a leading role in pushing for the Russian assets to be used  telling the Bundestag on the eve of the summit it was about sending a ""clear signal"" to Moscow that continuing the war was pointless. EU officials are confident they have a sound legal basis to use the frozen Russian assets  but so far the Belgian prime minister remains unconvinced.Hungary is seen as the biggest opponent of the move and  ahead of the summit  Prime Minister Orban and his entourage even suggested that the frozen assets plan had been removed from the summit agenda. A European Commission official stressed that was not the case and it would be a matter for the 27 member states at the summit. Slovakia's Robert Fico has also opposed using the Russian assets  if it means the money being used to procure weapons rather than for reconstruction needs. When the pivotal vote does finally take place  it will require a majority of at least 15 member states making up 65% of Europe's population to go through. Whatever happens  European Council President António Costa has promised not to go over the heads of the Belgians. ""We're not going to vote against Belgium "" he told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. ""We'll continue to work very intensively with the Belgian government because we don't want to approve something that might not be acceptable for Belgium."" Belgium will also be aware that ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on a negative watch  partly because of ""low"" legal risks to its balance sheet from the European Commission's plans to use the Russian assets. Euroclear's chief executive has also warned against the plan. ""We have to find a way to respond to Belgium's worries "" the Finnish official added. ""We are on the same side as Belgium. We will find a solution together to make sure all the risks are checked as much as they can be checked.""",negative,0.0,0.1,0.9,mixed,0.07,0.2,0.73,True,English,"['stark warning', 'EU leaders', 'frozen assets', 'Zelensky', 'Russia', 'European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'EPA Ursula von der Leyen', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'One European government official', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Prime Minister Orban', 'The European Commission', 'Finnish government official', 'White House official', 'other member states', '45-50bn [euro] deficit', 'AFP news agency', 'European-led multinational force', 'sound legal basis', 'multi-billion euro loan', 'latest peace proposals', 'next two years', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'The Brussels summit', 'Belgian parliament', 'Trump envoys', 'European divisions', 'European piglets', 'European allies', 'European Parliament', 'Viktor Orban', 'two choices', 'reparations loan', 'peace plan', 'peace negotiations', 'loan decision', 'stark warning', 'JOHN THYS/AFP', 'economic needs', 'Belgium-based organisation', 'pivotal moment', 'financial support', 'full-scale invasion', 'Russian officials', 'Kirill Dmitriev', 'Steve Witkoff', 'Jared Kushner', 'Ukrainian officials', 'many professionals', 'total degradation', 'derogatory description', 'Alexander KAZAKOV/POOL/AFP', 'executive arm', 'crunch time', 'next year', 'international markets', 'unanimous vote', 'momentous nature', 'leading role', 'clear signal', 'biggest opponent', 'President Zelensky', 'frozen assets', 'Russian assets', 'EU budget', 'EU officials', 'crunch summit', 'EU leaders', 'Moscow court', 'BBC correspondent', 'Kremlin envoy', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Russian money', 'spring Ukraine', 'EU money', 'agreement', 'end', 'military', 'months', 'cash', 'injection', 'production', 'drones', 'Euroclear', 'occasion', 'lawsuit', 'bid', 'solution', 'deal', 'eyes', 'Thursday', 'everything', 'rest', 'abyss', 'Europeans', 'parachute', 'February', 'Miami', 'talks', 'Kyiv', 'army', 'funding', 'recovery', 'expertise', 'plans', 'feelings', 'Wednesday', 'continent', 'collapse', 'favour', 'two-thirds', '€137bn', 'course', 'leverage', 'funds', 'head', 'cost', 'option', 'table', 'idea', 'guarantee', 'Hungary', 'hours', 'urgency', 'Bundestag', 'move', 'entourage']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,bbc.com

But a new U.S. arms deal with Taiwan could jeopardize those efforts—and exacerbate an already dangerous flash point in the Indo-Pacific.Welcome back to World Brief  where we’re looking at U.S. military support for Taiwan   the European Union considering the use of frozen Russian funds to aid Ukraine   and Australia ’s new penalties on hate speech.Welcome back to World Brief  where we’re looking at U.S. military support for Taiwan  the European Union considering the use of frozen Russian funds to aid Ukraine  and Australia’s new penalties on hate speech.Sign up to receive World Brief in your inbox every weekday.Asymmetric WarfareChinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump have tried to stabilize relations between their two countries during the latter’s second term in office  culminating in Trump’s upcoming visit to Beijing in April. But a new U.S. arms deal with Taiwan could jeopardize those efforts—and exacerbate an already dangerous flash point in the Indo-Pacific.On Wednesday  the Trump administration announced the United States’ largest-ever arms package for Taipei. Worth $11.1 billion  the deal includes more than $4 billion each for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (known as HIMARS) and M109 self-propelled howitzers  as well as more than $700 million for Javelin and TOW anti-tank missiles and Altius loitering munitions.This is the second U.S. arms sale to Taiwan in Trump’s second term  and if approved by the U.S. Congress  as is likely  then it will exceed the $8.4 billion in weapons sold to Taipei during the Biden administration.According to the U.S. National Security Strategy unveiled this month  Washington aims to deter conflict over Taiwan by “preserving military overmatch” against China in the region. To achieve this  the United States has encouraged Taipei to spend more on self-defense and to shift toward developing asymmetric warfare capabilities  using mobile  smaller  and cheaper weapons (such as drones). Similar tactics have proved successful in other conflicts—namely  in the Russia-Ukraine war.Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te appears to have heeded the Trump team’s message. Last month  Lai announced a $40 billion supplementary defense spending proposal that would focus on those smaller weapons. There is “no room for compromise on national security ” Lai said at the time. A few weeks later  Lai sent Taiwanese Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung to Washington for an unannounced visit with U.S. officials.The United States “continues to assist Taiwan in maintaining sufficient self-defense capabilities and in rapidly building strong deterrent power and leveraging asymmetric warfare advantages  which form the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability ” Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement this week.As expected  Beijing has denounced the U.S. arms deal with Taiwan  arguing that it “severely undermines peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait ” where China has significantly ramped up military pressure in recent weeks. “By aiding ‘Taiwan independence’ with weapons  the U.S. side will only bring fire upon itself ” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun added. “Using Taiwan to contain China is absolutely doomed to fail.”Today’s Most ReadWhat We’re FollowingFrozen Russian funds. European Union leaders convened in Brussels on Thursday to determine whether the bloc should use around $247 billion worth of frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help fund Ukraine’s war effort. The 27-nation group is considering using these immobilized funds to support Ukraine’s reconstruction and to back a $105 billion loan to Kyiv. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  if that loan is not provided  then Ukraine will run out of funding by spring and be forced to slash drone production—ultimately undermining its bargaining position with Russia.Several European nations have also argued that financing Ukraine’s fight is vital to protect their own borders from future Russian aggression. “Now we have a simple choice: either money today or blood tomorrow ” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday.However  the decision to use this money to aid Ukraine may come down to one country: Belgium  which holds nearly all of the Europe-based frozen Russian funds. On Thursday  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said he has yet to see sufficient guarantees protecting Brussels from legal and financial risks. This comes after Moscow’s central bank announced last week that it would sue Belgian financial group Euroclear over the threatened use of its frozen assets.Penalties for hate speech. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced new measures on Thursday aimed at penalizing those who “spread hate  division  and radicalization ” including antisemitism. The proposed legislation is in response to a mass shooting at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday  during which two gunmen opened fire on worshippers at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration  killing 15 people and wounding dozens more.Under the draft text  penalties would be imposed on preachers and organizations whose leaders promote violence and racial hatred. A new federal offense of “aggravated hate speech” would be introduced  with “hate” being made an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment. And Australia’s home affairs minister would be granted the ability to cancel or reject the visas of those deemed likely to spread hate and division in the country.Albanese has faced intense scrutiny in recent months over whether his administration has done enough to combat antisemitism  which has risen around the world since Hamas’s Oct. 7  2023  attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. In February  Canberra expanded the list of what it considers hate speech to include threatening to damage places of worship  and it increased penalties for displaying terrorism or Nazi symbols. In the immediate aftermath of the Bondi Beach shooting  Albanese also vowed to tighten the country’s already strict gun control laws.Strikes on Hezbollah. Israeli forces launched airstrikes on alleged Hezbollah infrastructure in southern and northeastern Lebanon on Thursday. According to Israeli military officials  the strikes targeted a Hezbollah compound used for training as well as several suspected weapons facilities.Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire in November 2024. However  from January to late November of this year  Israeli forces carried out nearly 1 600 strikes across Lebanon  according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project  killing at least 127 civilians. Hezbollah has refused to disarm while Israel bombards the group’s territory  but Israel maintains that strikes are necessary to force Hezbollah to surrender long-range missiles  precision-guided munitions  and drones believed to be held deeper inside Lebanon.On Friday  representatives from France  Israel  Lebanon  the United States  and the United Nations’ peacekeeping force in Lebanon will discuss enforcement of the 2024 cease-fire agreement—including securing international recognition that the Lebanese military can oversee the area south of the Litani River  the de facto line for both Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw from  as well as pressuring Israel to comply with the truce.Odds and EndsIt may not be Isla Nublar  but the Italian Alps were certainly a home for dinosaurs. Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera was trekking through Italy’s Lombardy region in September when he stumbled upon thousands of fossilized dinosaur footprints in the mountains’ steep slopes. Scientists publicly unveiled the findings on Tuesday  which were so well preserved that individual toe and claw marks are visible. Experts believe that the footprints date back more than 200 million years and came from long-necked  plant-eating prosauropods.

Alexander Nemenov | Via ReutersOne of Russia's last remaining allies in the European Union told CNBC he believes there is no way forward for proposals to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine via frozen Russian assets. The European Commission – the EU's executive arm – is considering using seized Russian assets held in Europe to provide further financial support to Ukraine. Speaking to CNBC as officials arrived at a European Council meeting  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said proposals to use the immobilized assets as a means to assist Ukraine had been ""killed."" ""It's [a] dead end. It's over "" he said. ""There is no sufficient level of support behind it."" Orbán is widely seen as Russia's closest ally within the EU  and has been a vocal critic of plans to use potentially hundreds of billions of euros of frozen assets to fund reparations loans for Kyiv. Hungary isn't alone in having doubts over the measures  however. Belgium  whose support is critical given that huge amounts of frozen assets lie in the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear  has expressed concern over possible legal and financial risks. Italy and Bulgaria have also supported Belgium's resistance to the proposals.watch nowFor its part  the Kremlin has said such a move would be tantamount to justification for war  and Russia's central bank announced last week it was suing Euroclear in a Moscow court ""for recovery of losses caused to the Bank of Russia."" The European Council meeting  due to conclude Friday  will have funding options for reparations loans to Ukraine high on the agenda. ""Without new additional financial support from the EU and other international donors  Ukraine is expected to run out of funds early in 2026 "" the European Parliament said in a briefing Wednesday  adding that Hungary had already blocked the option to use the headroom in the EU budget to provide funding to Kyiv. Decisions on use of the EU's own finances require a unanimous vote from all 27 member states to be passed. ""If both options proposed by the Commission are blocked  a 'coalition of the willing' could be the option of last resort "" the European Parliament said Wednesday. Asked ahead of Thursday's meetings if he was acting in Europe's or Russia's interests by working to block the use of Russian assets by the EU  Orbán said he was ""just working for peace.""

–The commission has floated a potential fallback plan of the EU raising the money itself to lend Ukraine.But officials say that scheme has been shelved as it requires unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 leaders and Hungary has ruled it out.De Wever nonetheless looks set to try to revive that idea  and other countries may be open to his arguments.“It is on the shelf  not in the bin ” said one EU diplomat  speaking like others on condition of anonymity. “But we are focused now on the reparations loan.”Bubbling close to the surface of the EU’s discussion are the US efforts to forge a deal to end the war.Ukraine has said Washington was “pressuring” the EU not to use the assets as they view them as a vital bargaining chip in winning over Russia.But EU officials deny that and say that  if anything  the push for peace has spurred the efforts to tap the Russian funds.Given that Ukraine has only months before the shortfalls bite  diplomats and officials insist leaders will find a way to keep funds flowing — even if this week yields only a loose deal with details to be hammered out later.“We need to find a solution ” said a second EU diplomat. “I’d be surprised if they break up on Saturday or Sunday without a decision.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Russian asset plan', 'crunch summit', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'outspoken prime minister Bart De Wever', 'Copyright AFP JOHN THYS', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Flemish nationalist De Wever', 'Italian premier Giorgia Meloni', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'international deposit organisation', 'vital bargaining chip', 'untested financial switcheroo', 'other member states', 'key political cover', 'frozen Russian assets', 'potential fallback plan', 'one EU diplomat', 'second EU diplomat', 'President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'next two years', 'other EU countries', 'other countries', 'key player', 'crippling financial', 'US efforts', 'Russian funds', 'Max DELANY', 'break summit', 'four-year mark', 'European Union', 'crucial moment', '135 billion euros', 'cash crunch', 'yawning gap', '210 billion euros', '90 billion euros', 'reparations loan', 'vast bulk', 'legal reprisals', 'Belgian worries', 'multiple layers', 'weighted majority', 'nuclear option', 'complex decisions', 'unanimous approval', 'shortfalls bite', 'Plan B', 'The EU', 'EU counterparts', 'quick deal', 'loose deal', '27-nation bloc', 'European Commission', 'EU officials', 'EU leaders', '27 leaders', 'Ukraine', 'Kyiv', 'Brussels', 'make', 'Belgium', 'pressure', 'opposition', 'hand', 'war', 'fighting', 'talks', 'agreement', 'survival', 'credibility', 'stake', 'ability', 'world', 'history', 'meeting', 'extra', 'April', 'bid', 'executive', 'scheme', 'Kremlin', 'damage', 'Euroclear', 'fears', 'Moscow', 'shot', 'bows', 'spotlight', 'way', 'protection', 'guarantees', 'risks', 'theory', 'initiative', 'money', 'Hungary', 'idea', 'arguments', 'shelf', 'bin', 'others', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'surface', 'discussion', 'Washington', 'push', 'peace', 'months', 'diplomats', 'week', 'details', 'solution', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,digitaljournal.com

At the heart of the debate lies a vast pool of frozen Russian central bank assets and a proposal that would defy international finance and law. The EU wants to use those immobilised funds to bankroll Ukraine’s survival and war. While a majority of EU states see this as both a moral decision and a strategic necessity  others warn that the plan could expose Europe to legal  financial and geopolitical consequences Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022  the EU  along with its Western partners  froze the foreign assets of the Russian central bank as part of sweeping sanctions. The EU currently holds roughly 210 billion euros in frozen Russian central bank assets  which translates to about $246 billion in U.S. dollars. Most of this  roughly 180 billion euros (around $211 billion)  are frozen at Euroclear in Belgium  and an estimated 176 billion euros (about $206 billion) of those have already converted into cash due to the maturation of bonds. Under the European Commission’s proposal  up to 90 billion euros (about $105 billion) of these funds could be used over the next two years as a reparations loan to support Ukraine’s military and civilian needs.These assets are largely sovereign bonds and other financial instruments. As sanctions prevent their repayment to Russia  many of the bonds have matured and converted into cash. While the EU has so far limited itself to using the interest generated by these assets to support Ukraine  the new proposal goes much further by leveraging the assets themselves.For the EU  the sheer scale of the frozen funds makes them attractive at a moment when Kyiv is projected to run out of money by mid-2026 without external support. With public finances strained across Europe and political fatigue over the war growing  these assets represent a rare source of funding that does not immediately burden European taxpayers or inflate national debt.The timing of the proposal reflects both urgency and calculation. European leaders increasingly view Russia’s war not as a distant conflict but as a direct threat to EU security. They think a Ukrainian defeat would embolden Moscow and bring the risk of Russian aggression closer to the EU’s borders.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that without a financing solution Ukraine could collapse financially and militarily within months. The Commission’s proposal  described as a “reparations loan”  would provide Ukraine with immediate funds  to be repaid only if and when Russia pays reparations for the damage caused by its invasion.Politically  the plan also tackles domestic pressures. After years of funding Ukraine through national budgets  many European governments are eager for a mechanism that spreads responsibility and minimises direct fiscal costs. Because the loan would require only a qualified majority at EU rather than unanimity  it bypasses the veto threat posed by countries such as Hungary.Belgium’s resistance has become the main obstacle to EU consensus on using frozen Russian assets. As the country hosting Euroclear  a depository which has the bulk of the frozen assets  Belgium faces most legal and financial risk if the plan is followed.Belgian officials argue that using the assets in this way amounts to an unprecedented and legally questionable use of sovereign property. Even though the European Commission says that the “cash balances” are no longer Russia’s property due to sanctions  Belgium fears that courts  particularly outside the EU  may not accept this interpretation. The Russian central bank has already filed lawsuits against Euroclear  seeking billions in damages.While the Commission has offered guarantees to cover potential repayment claims  Belgium argues these protections are too narrow. They would not cover the full spectrum of risks  including legal costs  damages awarded in lawsuits or losses stemming from Russian action against Euroclear’s assets abroad. Belgian leaders also want assurances against Russian retaliation within Russia itself  where European companies still hold significant assets.In essence  Belgium fears becoming the main collateral damage of a collective EU decision  a risk it is unwilling to take without far stronger assurances.Russia has made clear that it would not accept the use of its frozen assets without consequences. The Kremlin has already called the proposal a theft and has warned of retaliation. One option is legal warfare  targeting Euroclear and potentially EU states in courts around the world.Beyond lawsuits  Russia could seize European assets within its own jurisdiction. An estimated $127 billion worth of US  EU and UK corporate assets remain in Russia. Confiscating or nationalising those holdings would inflict real economic damage on European companies.There is also a broader strategic dimension. By framing the move as a violation of sovereign property rights  Russia hopes to undermine global trust in Europe as a safe place to hold reserves. This argument resonates beyond Russia itself and underlines concerns raised by countries such as China  which may fear that its assets could one day be frozen or taken away during a geopolitical crisis.If the EU proceeds  it would set a historic precedent. Using frozen sovereign assets to finance a war effort  even indirectly through a loan  would blur long-standing legal boundaries. While many European leaders see this as justified by Russia’s aggression  the long-term consequences are uncertain.One risk is reputational. Europe’s financial system relies heavily on trust  predictability and respect for property rights. Any perception that sovereign assets can be politically snatched away may deter future investment or encourage other countries to move reserves elsewhere.Another risk is internal consensus. The dispute has exposed fault lines between member states with different risk tolerances  legal mechanisms and geopolitical priorities. If Belgium’s concerns are overridden without adequate compromise  it could weaken solidarity at a time when the EU seeks to project unity.Yet  failing to secure long-term financing for Ukraine could hasten Kyiv’s defeat  fundamentally altering Europe’s security landscape. The EU thinks the Russian assets are the only option even if risky.

Russia has warned the EU against using its money.It has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in a bid to get its money back.The Brussels summit comes at a pivotal moment.US President Donald Trump has said a deal to end the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - is ""closer now than we have been ever"".Although Russia has not responded to the latest peace proposals  the Kremlin has stressed that plans for a European-led multinational force for Ukraine supported by the US would not be acceptable.President Vladimir Putin made his feelings towards Europe clear on Wednesday  when he said the continent was in a state of ""total degradation"" and ""European piglets"" - a derogatory description of Ukraine's European allies - were hoping to profit from Russia's collapse.The European Commission has proposed loaning Kyiv about €90bn (£79bn) over the next two years - out of the €210bn of Russian assets sitting in Europe.That is about two-thirds of the €137bn that Kyiv is thought to need to get through 2026 and 2027.(Excerpt) Read more at bbc.com ...TOPICS:UkraineKEYWORDS:europeforeverwarleftards4ww3proxywarrussiatheftukrainewelfarewarClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.To: MinorityRepublicanHah  that won’t be any “loan”.

The U.S. banking system is today controlled by the federal government which itself is technically bankrupt. Speaking of the financial health of the U.S. government how is the audit of the U.S. gold reserves at Fort Knox promised by presidential candidate Donald Trump progressing. He’s been in office nearly a year. How long does it take to assay a statistically significant number of bars and count the remainder.? The gold audit seems to have been pushed down the memory hole with the Epstein files. No problem.

That reflected growth of about 14 percent  while during the previous two periods  it saw growth of 44 percent and more than 150 percent.Its operating profits are also ""showing signs of fatigue "" according to the paper  with profits falling to 7.7 percent of net sales last fiscal year  compared to 9.8 percent profits the previous year.The chain's growth in Finland was quick  Kauppalehti points out. Normal opened its first shop at the Sello shopping centre in Espoo in 2021 — now it has nearly 100 outlets across the country.Heikki Peltola  who the paper explains has followed retail markets for the past 35 years  calls Normal a ""sensation"" with an ""unusual story"".""Normal is different and surprising. That's what people are looking for  not everyday boring stores. Normal speaks the language of people and its marketing has humor that many people find alienating or don't understand "" Peltola says  according to Kauppalehti.Market analyst Ahri Kivilahti tells the paper that Normal has grown at a fast clip while maintaining high profitability.In terms of business volumes  Normal has already outpaced sales at Finnish home goods retailer Jysk  he says.According to Kivilahti  Normal may well surpass Stockmann and R-kioski in that regard next.Kivilahti says that despite its current slight slowdown  ""Normal is a great success story in Finland.""Finns investing betterNordea Bank is by far the most popular firm on the Helsinki Stock Exchange among Finnish investors  according to Swedish-language daily Hufvudstadsbladet.It said that more than 350 000 people in Finland own shares in the bank  and that number increased this year.Finns tend to prefer investing in major listed companies that pay higher dividends  the paper explained  citing figures from Euroclear.Other firms that Finns invest the most in include networking giant Nokia  financial group Mandatum and energy firm Fortum.The CEO of the Finnish Foundation for Share Promotion (Pörssisäätiö in Finnish)  Sari Lounasmeri  tells the paper that Finnish investors generally hold onto shares they've acquired for a long time  saying that's a positive thing.Investors are also increasingly interested in diversifying their holdings and spreading out their risks across various companies and industries. According to Lounasmeri  this means that the poor performance of a single company doesn't cause investors' portfolios to drain away.She also noted that men and women tend to invest in different things. According to a Danske Bank survey  men's investments and savings roughly double those of women.While men have an average of 42 400 euros in investments and savings accounts  the corresponding amount for women is 22 800 euros  according to the survey.Another gender difference is the type of companies male and female investors turn to. According to Euroclear data  women have invested more in fashion firms Lindex and Marimekko than men.At the same time  men invest more in companies like defence and security tech firm Summa Defence as well as forestry equipment company Ponsse  according to HBL.Influenza peak yet to comeThe peak of the ongoing influenza pandemic is expected to start after Christmas or early next year  according to the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)  newspaper Ilta-Sanomat reports.Cases are rapidly spreading  and can take out several workers at care homes and units  according to the chief physician in the wellbeing services county of South Savo  Hans Gärdström.""The situation was calm just a week or two ago. Now  around the middle of the week  we've noticed an increase in absences "" he tells the paper.Flu cases have spread in both wards and outpatient settings  the paper reports. According to Gärdström  cases have been spreading more easily than in recent years. The epidemic also started a bit earlier than usual this year.""The spread is rapid once it has entered a unit "" he said.However  the pandemic's peak is looming in the near future  according to the chief physician.The article included a heat map of the number of confirmed influenza cases across Finland. The largest case numbers were seen in Central Ostrobothnia.Finnish authorities have confirmed more than 3 240 influenza A infections in the country. However  there have only been a few dozen confirmed cases of influenza B  according to THL.Gärdström advised people with flu symptoms to stay at home and avoid meeting others.",neutral,0.07,0.87,0.07,mixed,0.62,0.09,0.29,True,English,"['Discount store', 'favourite investments', 'Thursday', 'papers', 'boom', 'Finns', 'influenza', 'Finnish home goods retailer Jysk', 'Danish discount store chain Normal', 'Hans Gärdström', 'Sello shopping centre', 'current slight slowdown', 'Helsinki Stock Exchange', 'Swedish-language daily Hufvudstadsbladet', 'networking giant Nokia', 'Pörssisäätiö', 'newspaper Ilta-Sanomat reports', 'wellbeing services county', 'largest case numbers', 'previous two periods', 'great success story', 'forestry equipment company', '3,240 influenza A infections', 'security tech firm', 'everyday boring stores', 'dozen confirmed cases', 'major listed companies', 'ongoing influenza pandemic', 'Danske Bank survey', 'everyday items', 'other stores', 'previous year', 'unusual story', 'single company', 'influenza B', 'popular firm', 'energy firm', 'Finnish Foundation', 'Finnish authorities', 'influenza cases', 'first shop', 'short period', 'turquoise-hued shops', 'face creams', 'pet treats', 'annual turnover', 'fiscal year', 'retail markets', 'past 35 years', 'Market analyst', 'fast clip', 'high profitability', 'business volumes', 'Nordea Bank', 'higher dividends', 'Other firms', 'financial group', 'Share Promotion', 'positive thing', 'poor performance', 'different things', 'corresponding amount', 'gender difference', 'fashion firms', 'several workers', 'care homes', 'chief physician', 'South Savo', 'outpatient settings', 'recent years', 'near future', 'heat map', 'Central Ostrobothnia', 'flu symptoms', 'Finnish investors', 'Flu cases', 'various companies', 'Influenza peak', 'operating profits', 'long time', 'same time', 'female investors', 'net sales', 'Heikki Peltola', 'Sari Lounasmeri', 'savings accounts', 'Euroclear data', 'Summa Defence', '200 million euros', 'Ahri Kivilahti', 'many people', 'business paper', '9.8 percent profits', '42,400 euros', '22,800 euros', '14 percent', '44 percent', '150 percent', '7.7 percent', '350,000 people', 'Finland', '100 outlets', 'country', 'Kauppalehti', 'growth', 'shampoo', 'snacks', 'candies', 'products', 'brands', 'July', 'signs', 'fatigue', 'Espoo', 'marketing', 'humor', 'terms', 'Stockmann', 'R-kioski', 'regard', 'Finns', 'shares', 'figures', 'Mandatum', 'Fortum', 'CEO', 'holdings', 'risks', 'industries', 'portfolios', 'women', 'investments', 'average', 'type', 'Lindex', 'Marimekko', 'Ponsse', 'HBL.', 'Christmas', 'Institute', 'Health', 'Welfare', 'THL', 'units', 'situation', 'middle', 'week', 'increase', 'absences', 'wards', 'epidemic', 'spread', 'article', 'others']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,yle.fi

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for a decision now to keep Ukraine afloat in the new year.At a summit in Brussels with exceptionally high stakes for both the EU and Ukraine  the 27-nation bloc’s leaders are set to decide on whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine’s military and financial needs over the next two years.The bulk of the assets — some 193 billion euros ($227 billion) as of September — are held in the Brussels-based financial clearing house Euroclear. Russia’s Central Bank sued Euroclear last week.“Give me a parachute and we’ll all jump together ” Prime Minister Bart De Wever told members of the Belgian parliament just before the summit began. “If we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn’t be a problem.”Belgium raises its concerns as it faces Russian pressureBelgium fears that Russia will strike back and would prefer that the bloc borrow the money on international markets. It wants frozen assets held in other European countries to be thrown into the pot as well  and for its partners to guarantee that Euroclear will have the funds it needs should it come under legal attack.European officials say Russia is waging a campaign of sabotage and disruption across the continent. The Central Bank lawsuit ramped up pressure on Belgium and its European partners ahead of the summit.The “reparations loan” plan would see the EU give 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine. Countries like the U.K.  Canada and Norway would make up any shortfall.Russia's claim to the assets would still stand  but the assets would remain locked away at least until the Kremlin ends its war on Ukraine and pays for the massive damage it's caused.In mapping out the loan plan  the European Commission set up safeguards to protect Belgium  but De Wever remains unconvinced.“I have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium’s concerns "" he said. ""I hope to see one today.”De Wever insisted that Belgium remains “a faithful ally” of Ukraine and wants to continue to help.Soon after arriving in Brussels  Zelenskyy sat down with the Belgian prime minister to make his case for freeing up the frozen funds. The war-ravaged country is at risk of bankruptcy and needs new money by spring.“Ukraine has the right to this money because Russia is destroying us  and to use these assets against these attacks is absolutely just '' Zelenskyy told a news conference.In an appeal to Belgian citizens who share their leader's worries about retaliation  Zelenskyy said  “One can fear certain legal steps in courts from the Russian Federation  but it’s not as scary as when Russia is at your borders.''“So while Ukraine is defending Europe  you must help Ukraine.”Whatever method they use  the EU leaders have pledged to meet most of Ukraine's needs in 2026 and 2027. The International Monetary Fund estimates that would amount to 137 billion euros ($160 billion).“We have to find a solution today "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters. EU Council President António Costa  who is chairing the meeting  has vowed to keep leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached  even if it takes days.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: “Now we have a simple choice. Either money today or blood tomorrow.""EU envoys have worked around the clock in recent weeks to flesh out the details and narrow differences among the 27 member countries. If enough countries object  the plan could be blocked. There is no majority support for a plan B of raising the funds on international markets.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he hopes Belgium's concerns can be addressed.""The reactions of the Russian president in recent hours show how necessary this is. In my view  this is indeed the only option. We are basically faced with the choice of using European debt or Russian assets for Ukraine  and my opinion is clear: We must use the Russian assets.”Hungary and Slovakia oppose von der Leyen’s plan for a reparations loan. Apart from Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy and Malta are also undecided.“I would not like a European Union in war "" said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  who sees himself as a peacemaker. He’s also Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe. “To give money means war.”Orbán described the loan plan as “a dead end.''The outcome of the summit has significant ramifications for Europe's place in negotiations to end the war. The United States wants assurances that the Europeans are intent on supporting Ukraine financially and backing it militarily  even as the peace talks drag on with few results so far.The loan plan in particular also poses important challenges to the way the bloc goes about its business. Should a two-thirds majority of EU leaders decide to impose the scheme on Belgium  which has most to lose  the impact on decision-making in Europe would be profound.The EU depends on consensus  and finding voting majorities and avoiding vetoes in the future could become infinitely more complex if one of the EU's founding members is forced to weather an attack on its interests by its very own partners.De Wever too must weigh whether the cost of holding out against a majority is worth the hit his government's credibility would take in Europe.Whatever is decided  the process does not end at this summit. Legal experts would have to convert any political deal into a workable agreement  and some national parliaments may have to weigh in before the loan money could start flowing to Ukraine.",neutral,0.01,0.85,0.14,mixed,0.09,0.26,0.65,True,English,"['Russian retaliation', 'EU leaders', 'massive loan', 'Belgium', 'protection', 'Ukraine', 'EU Council President António Costa', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'The International Monetary Fund', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'The Central Bank lawsuit', 'Belgian prime minister', 'The United States', 'next two years', 'Trusted News Source', 'other European countries', 'European Union partners', 'Ukrainian President', 'international markets', 'news conference', 'financial needs', 'EU envoys', 'Belgian parliament', 'Belgian citizens', 'Russian pressureBelgium', 'European officials', 'European partners', 'European Commission', 'Russian Federation', 'European debt', 'Live Events', 'ironclad guarantees', 'new year', 'high stakes', 'legal attack', 'U.K.', 'massive damage', 'faithful ally', 'war-ravaged country', 'legal steps', 'recent weeks', '27 member countries', 'enough countries', 'majority support', 'recent hours', 'closest ally', 'dead end', 'significant ramifications', 'peace talks', 'important challenges', 'massive loan', 'reparations loan', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian assets', 'EU leaders', 'plan B', '27-nation bloc', 'frozen assets', 'simple choice', 'loan plan', '193 billion euros', '90 billion euros', 'frozen funds', 'Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'new money', '137 billion', 'Reliable', 'Addas', 'Thursday', 'Ukraine', 'decision', 'summit', 'tens', 'billions', 'military', 'bulk', 'September', 'Euroclear', 'parachute', 'members', 'confidence', 'problem', 'concerns', 'pot', 'campaign', 'sabotage', 'disruption', 'continent', 'Canada', 'Norway', 'shortfall', 'claim', 'Kremlin', 'safeguards', 'text', 'case', 'risk', 'bankruptcy', 'spring', 'right', 'attacks', 'appeal', 'worries', 'courts', 'borders', 'method', 'solution', 'reporters', 'meeting', 'agreement', 'days', 'blood', 'clock', 'details', 'differences', 'reactions', 'view', 'option', 'opinion', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Bulgaria', 'Italy', 'Malta', 'peacemaker', 'outcome', 'place', 'negotiations', 'assurances', 'Europeans', 'results']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,economictimes.indiatimes.com

The EU considers Russia’s war in Ukraine a direct threat to its own security and estimates that  without European financial support  Ukraine could run out of funds in the second quarter of next year  raising the risk of military defeat. EU officials believe such an outcome would increase the threat of Russian aggression against the EU itself.The plan under discussion would use frozen assets of the Russian central bank  worth approximately €210 billion  as collateral for a loan to Ukraine. Of this amount  €185 billion is held at Belgium-based Euroclear  making Belgium a key player in the negotiations. Belgian authorities  however  have raised strong concerns about potential legal and financial risks  particularly in the event of legal action by Russia.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on European leaders to take immediate decisions  stating that there is a clear choice between providing funding now or facing greater costs later. He said there is broad agreement that the loan-based solution is the preferred option  although many technical issues remain unresolved.According to a European diplomat cited by Politico  the Belgian delegation submitted a two-page document outlining extensive conditions for supporting the plan. These include demands for full legal protection if Russia were to take legal action against Belgium over the use of the assets held in Brussels—demands that have met resistance from other member states.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told the Belgian parliament that he has not yet received sufficient guarantees to cover liquidity risks and potential legal claims  noting that the financing plans are still evolving.At the same time  EU officials are examining alternative options in case the plan fails. Three EU diplomats said a legal mechanism known as “enhanced cooperation” is being considered  which would allow a group of countries—led by Italy and Belgium—to issue joint debt for Ukraine  bypassing the requirement for unanimity and excluding Hungary. Hungary has already said it would veto any solution based on the EU budget.Diplomatic sources stress  however  that using frozen Russian assets remains the only realistic option. The latest draft of the summit conclusions provides for a political decision to move forward with the loan and for officials to urgently resolve the technical details  including explicit provisions for sharing risks among member states to reassure Belgium and other cautious countries.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas estimated the chances of reaching an agreement at 50–50  saying that failure is not an option. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed cautious optimism  saying he believes an agreement is achievable.All other substantive items on the summit agenda—including EU enlargement  the Middle East  and migration—have already been agreed  leaving Ukraine’s financing as the sole unresolved and decisive issue.,neutral,0.05,0.86,0.09,negative,0.0,0.46,0.54,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU leaders', 'use', 'Ukraine', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Two senior EU officials', 'other substantive items', 'Russian central bank', 'Three EU diplomats', 'many technical issues', 'full legal protection', 'other member states', 'European Council building', 'EU member states', 'potential legal claims', 'European financial support', 'other cautious countries', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgian authorities', 'Belgian delegation', 'Belgian parliament', 'frozen assets', 'Russian aggression', 'EU budget', 'EU enlargement', 'technical details', 'cautious optimism', 'legal action', 'legal mechanism', 'European leaders', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'European diplomat', 'financial risks', 'continuous consultations', 'vast majority', 'clearing house', 'main parameters', 'Thursday night', 'early hours', 'political importance', 'second quarter', 'next year', 'military defeat', 'key player', 'strong concerns', 'immediate decisions', 'clear choice', 'greater costs', 'two-page document', 'extensive conditions', 'sufficient guarantees', 'same time', 'alternative options', 'enhanced cooperation', 'joint debt', 'Diplomatic sources', 'latest draft', 'summit conclusions', 'explicit provisions', 'summit agenda', 'Middle East', 'sole unresolved', 'decisive issue', 'liquidity risks', 'direct threat', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'loan-based solution', 'political decision', '€210 billion loan', 'financing plans', 'realistic option', 'broad agreement', 'Newsroom', 'Brussels', 'Ukraine', 'negotiations', 'unity', 'credibility', 'Reuters', 'advisers', 'effort', 'differences', 'total', 'talks', 'likelihood', 'Friday', 'Kyiv', 'war', 'security', 'funds', 'outcome', 'discussion', 'collateral', 'amount', 'event', 'funding', 'Politico', 'demands', 'resistance', 'case', 'group', 'Italy', 'requirement', 'unanimity', 'Hungary', 'chances', 'failure', 'migration']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,en.protothema.gr

Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPABelgian politicians and senior finance executives have been subject to a campaign of intimidation orchestrated by Russian intelligence aimed at persuading the country to block the use of €185 billion assets for Ukraine  according to European intelligence agencies.Security officials have indicated that there had been deliberate targeting of key figures at Euroclear  the securities depository holding the majority of Russia’s frozen assets  and leaders of the country.EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday are debating whether to approve the lending of urgently needed funds for Ukraine secured on Russian central bank assets  critical to maintain Kyiv’s war effort through 2026 and 2027.Belgium is in focus because €185 billion of the €210 billon of Russia central bank assets frozen by the EU since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is held at the Brussels-based Euroclear.Speaking in the European Parliament on the eve of the summit  the European Commission president  Ursula von der Leyen  said: “There is no more important act of European defence than supporting Ukraine’s defence.” She added that “the next days will be crucial in securing this”.Russia has publicly warned that utilising the assets would amount to theft and its central bank said it is seeking $230 billion in damages from Euroclear in a case brought in the country’s courts. But it is understood the intimidation campaign has been focused on key individuals.[ The €90 billion question: will Belgium sign up to frozen assets plan for Ukraine?Opens in new window ]Threats have been directed at Valérie Urbain  the chief executive of Euroclear  and other senior executives at the financial services group.Euroclear declined to comment: “Any potential threats are treated with the utmost priority and investigated deeply  often with the support of authorities as appropriate.”An investigation earlier this month by the news site EUobserver referenced threats made to Ms Urbain in 2024 and 2025  and that she asked for Belgian police protection. This was denied and she and other companies executives then hired first a Belgian  then a French security firm to provide bodyguards  according to the report.A profile interview of Ms Urbain by Le Monde in November reported that she had been accompanied by a bodyguard for more than a year  though she did not comment directly on her security.EU president Ursula von der Leyen  Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever and German chancellor Frierdrich Merz. Photograph: Nicolas Maeterlinck/AFP/Getty ImagesIn early December  Bart De Wever  Belgium’s prime minister  said in an onstage interview with La Libre newspaper: “And who believes that Putin will calmly accept the confiscation of Russian assets? Moscow has let us know that in the event of a seizure  Belgium and I personally will feel the effects for eternity.”Asked to explain these comments earlier this month  the prime minister’s office referred to previous remarks made by Mr De Wever  describing the legal and financial risks facing western companies.At a press conference in October  Mr De Wever had said: “Moscow has told us that if we touch the money  we would feel the consequences until eternity ” and went on to evoke Russian countermeasures  including confiscation of western money frozen in Russian banks  seizure of western companies and similar decisions from Moscow-friendly jurisdictions.Security forces stand guard prior to Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever meeting with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German chancellor Friedrich Merz in Brussels  Belgium. Photograph: EPAThe spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the reported threats against Belgian government ministers or the head of Euroclear  citing safety reasons.A spokesperson for Belgium’s foreign minister  Maxime Prévot  who is also deputy prime minister and has been involved in talks on the reparations loan  said they had “no such information” about threats to him.The UK  which is believed to hold €27 billion of Russia’s frozen assets  supports the move to use immobilised funds for Ukraine. Belgium has also been insisting that other countries holding Russian assets  estimated to be worth €290 billion worldwide  take similar actions to show solidarity and reduce the legal risk.Keir Starmer  the UK prime minister  told the businessman Roman Abramovich to release £2.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of Chelsea football club in 2022 within 90 days or face legal action. Britain wants all the money to be given to Ukrainian war victims  but the billionaire has said he also wants Russian victims to benefit.Ukrainian officials and experts acknowledge the EU loan is central to maintaining the country’s war effort for the next couple of years. Nataliia Shapoval  the head of the KSE Institute  a Kyiv based economic thinktank  said Ukraine required $50 billion in external financing in 2026  but only half of which had already been committed.The economist described the need for fresh international financing as “absolutely critical”. In particular  Ukraine’s defence ministry needed predictable flows of cash to ensure that it could buy weapons at the rates needed and so its armaments industry could make capital investments for the future.Though Ukraine could get through the first quarter of the year without the additional support from the EU  “big problems would arise from quarter two and even more in the second half of the year”  with Kyiv likely forced to cut defence budgets and make difficult trade-offs with social expenditure.Ukrainian officials hope that an EU funding deal could put Russia under medium-term financial pressure. Next year  38 per cent of Russia’s state budget will go on funding its military  while it is expected to end this year with a budget gap of about $70 billion  according to Shapoval. - Guardian,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,negative,0.01,0.38,0.61,True,English,"['Belgian leaders', 'frozen assets', 'Russia', 'use', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'German chancellor Frierdrich Merz', 'German chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Kyiv based economic thinktank', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Russia central bank assets', 'Mr De Wever', 'deputy prime minister', 'UK prime minister', 'Belgian police protection', 'Belgian government ministers', 'senior finance executives', 'La Libre newspaper', 'Maxime Prévot', 'businessman Roman Abramovich', 'Chelsea football club', 'other senior executives', 'financial services group', 'Valérie Urbain', 'European Commission president', 'European intelligence agencies', 'other companies executives', 'French security firm', 'frozen assets plan', 'Ukrainian war victims', 'The Brussels-based Euroclear', 'Belgian politicians', 'foreign minister', 'The UK', 'Russian assets', 'Russian intelligence', 'Russian victims', 'other countries', '€185 billion assets', 'European Parliament', 'financial risks', 'Ukrainian officials', 'war effort', 'Ms Urbain', 'western companies', 'Russian countermeasures', 'Russian banks', 'EU president', 'European defence', 'full-scale invasion', 'Olivier Matthys/EPA', 'Security officials', 'deliberate targeting', 'key figures', 'securities depository', 'important act', 'key individuals', '€90 billion question', 'new window', 'chief executive', 'utmost priority', 'news site', 'profile interview', 'Le Monde', 'a year', 'Nicolas Maeterlinck', 'AFP/Getty Images', 'early December', 'onstage interview', 'previous remarks', 'press conference', 'similar decisions', 'Moscow-friendly jurisdictions', 'Security forces', 'safety reasons', 'reparations loan', 'similar actions', 'Keir Starmer', 'next couple', 'Nataliia Shapoval', 'KSE Institute', 'legal risk', 'legal action', 'EU loan', 'next days', 'immobilised funds', 'western money', 'potential threats', 'EU leaders', 'intimidation campaign', '90 days', '€210 billon', 'start', 'Ukraine', 'Photograph', 'country', 'use', 'majority', 'Thursday', 'lending', 'Belgium', 'focus', 'summit', 'theft', 'damages', 'case', 'courts', 'support', 'authorities', 'investigation', 'EUobserver', 'bodyguards', 'report', 'November', 'Putin', 'confiscation', 'event', 'seizure', 'effects', 'eternity', 'comments', 'office', 'October', 'consequences', 'spokesperson', 'Wednesday', 'head', 'talks', 'information', 'move', 'solidarity', 'proceeds', 'sale', 'Britain', 'billionaire', 'experts', 'years', '£']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,irishtimes.com
54399,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/12/18/money-today-or-blood-tomorrow-europe-debates-seizing-russian-cash/,'Money Today or Blood Tomorrow': EU Urged to Act and Use Frozen Russian Billions to Fund Ukraine,Europe pulled in two directions over whether to approve a financial structure using frozen Russian assets to enable a mega loan to Ukraine.The post ‘Money Today or Blood Tomorrow’: EU Urged to Act and Use Frozen Russian Billions to Fund Ukraine appeared firs…,Europe faces a question of “money today  or blood tomorrow”  its leaders were told as they entered crunch meetings on whether to approve a financial structure using frozen Russian assets to enable a mega loan to Ukraine.The leaders of European Union member states met for a session of the European Council on Thursday  talks which are expected to go all day  for discussions on using frozen Russian assets held in European countries to guarantee a loan to Ukraine to keep it solvent. The European Union believes Kyiv needs a cash injection of $160 billion to pay for its military and civil expenses for the next two years  and that it faces running out of money as soon as Spring if urgent action isn’t taken.This morning  President Zelensky said if the deal isn’t passed  “there will be a big problem for Ukraine”. Ursula von der Leyen  meanwhile  stated: “we have one ultimate goal in this European Council  and that is peace for Ukraine  peace through strength  and for that  Ukraine needs to have a secure funding for the next two years… the most important part is that  at the end of the day  we have secured the funding for Ukraine”.In the past  European states have helped fund Ukraine’s national defence by using the interest earned on the approximately $250 billion in Russian assets held by European banks. Under the new plan  Ukraine would be loaned the Russian capital itself  which is being counted against hypothetical future Russian reparation payments to Ukraine. In essence  Russia would pay Ukraine war reparations following an assumed future military defeat  which would allow Kyiv to repay the loan to Brussels  which would in turn allow the EU to give Russia its seized assets back  states the BBC.Several key European partners profess concern about this approach  and no less than the government of Belgium  the home of the Euroclear securities system where the majority of that Russian wealth is held. Belgium has so far blocked the idea because it is worried Russia will  in time  take its revenge on their country for allowing the money entrusted there to be used in the war. Thursday’s meetings are largely intended to find ways to either assuage or override Belgium’s concerns.Hungary is another European state standing against the war loan  and against cash support for Ukraine in general  feelings stemming both from its bad relationship with Kyiv that well predates the Russian invasions  and out of its desire not to push Europe into an all-out war with Russia. Expressing his case against the loan  Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is reported to have said before going into today’s talks: “The whole idea is stupid. … There are two countries which are at war – it’s not European Union  [it’s] Russia and Ukraine – and the European Union would like to take away the money of one of the warring party and then to give it to another one. It’s marching into the war. The Belgian prime minister is right  we should not do that.”The loan idea is also opposed behind the scenes by the United States  The Times of London states overnight  with Washington reportedly lobbying European nations to block the deal because it is antithetical to President Trump’s ongoing bid for peace. Taking Russia’s frozen assets and using them to fund the war removes incentives for Moscow to sit at the negotiating table and agree to a deal  it is said the Trump team believes  because the prospect of reintegrating its economy with the wider world becomes a more remote prospect.The Times cited an unnamed Ukrainian official as their source  and also printed a dismissal by White House press secretary Anna Kelly  who said: “Spitballing from anonymous sources who were not present for these discussions should not be taken seriously”.Meanwhile the pressure on European countries to approve the loan deal continues. Poland  perhaps the most hawkish country in Europe on Russia — given in any theoretical future war its national territory would inevitably become the eastern European battleground — painted a picture of the Ukraine loan as a necessary down payment on future peace.Prime Minister and former Eurocrat Donald Tusk said of the proposed deal: “we have a simple choice: either money today  or blood tomorrow… I’m not talking about Ukraine only  I’m talking about Europe.”Russia  for its part  seems to have promised blood either way. President Vladimir Putin called the loan proposal “piracy”  the European states proposing it “swine” or “piglets”  and Moscow warned of “the harshest” retaliation.,negative,0.0,0.45,0.55,mixed,0.06,0.19,0.75,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Billions', 'Blood Tomorrow', 'Money', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'White House press secretary Anna Kelly', 'hypothetical future Russian reparation payments', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'former Eurocrat Donald Tusk', 'Several key European partners', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'European Union member states', 'Euroclear securities system', 'Belgian prime minister', 'unnamed Ukrainian official', 'necessary down payment', 'next two years', 'eastern European battleground', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'future military defeat', 'one ultimate goal', 'theoretical future war', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The European Union', 'Ukraine war reparations', 'European states', 'frozen assets', 'Russian capital', 'Russian wealth', 'Russian invasions', 'two countries', 'United States', 'future peace', 'European Council', 'European countries', 'European banks', 'European nations', 'President Zelensky', 'The Times', 'President Trump', 'financial structure', 'cash injection', 'civil expenses', 'urgent action', 'big problem', 'national defence', 'new plan', 'cash support', 'bad relationship', 'warring party', 'ongoing bid', 'negotiating table', 'Trump team', 'wider world', 'anonymous sources', 'national territory', 'simple choice', 'harshest” retaliation', 'mega loan', 'loan proposal', 'crunch meetings', 'secure funding', 'important part', 'remote prospect', 'hawkish country', 'war loan', 'loan idea', 'Ukraine loan', 'loan deal', 'question', 'money', 'blood', 'leaders', 'session', 'Thursday', 'talks', 'discussions', 'Kyiv', 'Spring', 'strength', 'end', 'past', 'interest', 'essence', 'Brussels', 'turn', 'BBC', 'concern', 'approach', 'government', 'Belgium', 'home', 'majority', 'revenge', 'ways', 'Hungary', 'feelings', 'desire', 'case', 'today', 'scenes', 'London', 'Washington', 'incentives', 'Moscow', 'economy', 'dismissal', 'pressure', 'Poland', 'picture', 'piglets']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,breitbart.com

In addition  the company confirms that its shares will shortly transition to the Euronext Brussels continuous market.Investment in third-generation antimony recyclingAt its Board meeting of 17 December 2025  Campine approved an investment in the third generation of its proprietary antimony recycling technology. This next step will enable Campine to produce an additional 800 to 1 000 tonnes per year of commercial-grade antimony metal from a wide range of industrial waste streams.Previous generations of Campine’s technology focused on the direct recycling of waste streams into antimony trioxide. While these products will continue to be fully utilised within Campine’s own operations  the new technology will also enable the company to commercialise recycled antimony metal to third parties in Europe  for specific applications where this critical raw material is required.The investment amounts to approximately EUR 7 million  with the new installation expected to become operational by mid-2027. Campine remains the only company worldwide with proprietary technology capable of recycling antimony from industrial waste streams directly into new commercial products.Transition to the Euronext Brussels continuous marketCampine has been listed on the stock exchange since 1936  with its shares historically traded on the Euronext Brussels double fixing market. Over the past year  demand for the Campine share has increased significantly. The fixing market is designed for shares with relatively limited trading activity  typically fewer than 2 500 transactions per year. In contrast  the Campine share has already recorded more than 10 000 transactions in 2025.Following consultations with market specialists and Euronext management  Campine’s Board of Directors has decided to request the transition of the Campine share to the Euronext Brussels continuous market. This transition is expected to take place in the coming days.Trading on the continuous market will allow shareholders to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day  improving accessibility and trading flexibility. According to CEO Wim De Vos: “The move to the continuous market will increase the visibility of our share and is expected to lead to a modest improvement in liquidity.”Business updateAfter peaking at approximately USD 60 000 per tonne during the summer  the antimony market has cooled off. Prices have returned to levels below USD 40 000 per tonne  comparable to those observed around twelve months ago.“This correction is a healthy development ” said Wim De Vos. “At peak price levels  some customers began substituting antimony trioxide due to cost pressure. We are now seeing demand gradually recover.”Prices are expected to ease somewhat further as antimony metal supply has been restored through the commissioning of new smelters in Southeast Asia. China has not resumed exports of antimony compounds  including antimony trioxide  despite earlier indications that export restrictions might be relaxed.Campine continues to hold a global leadership position in the antimony trioxide market.The integration of the three acquired Ecobat sites within Campine’s Circular Metals Division is progressing as planned. Initial synergies in battery recycling have already been implemented  with full synergy benefits expected during 2026.2025 results outlookCampine confirms its previously communicated operational outlook for 2025  expecting an EBITDA exceeding EUR 80 million for the former Campine perimeter (excluding the Ecobat acquisition).

DSR is Sequana Medical’s drug development program for the treatment of cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic-resistant heart failure.U.S. patent number 12 496 384 B2 is entitled “Formulations and Methods for Direct sodium removal in patients having heart failure and/or severe renal dysfunction” and covers the DSR infusate and its method of operation. Specifically  it covers the use of a no or low sodium infusate that is administered to a patient’s peritoneal cavity to directly remove sodium  and thereby fluid from the body to alleviate fluid overload in heart failure patients with residual renal function.Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  commented: “We are very pleased with the granting of this additional US patent  which we believe provides significant additional protection for our DSR programme. This patent builds upon our extensive pre-clinical and clinical experience of DSR  including the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies and strengthens the protection for our second generation DSR infusate. This is the formulation for the US MOJAVE randomised controlled study and the one that we believe can deliver significant clinical benefits to clinicians and patients  as well as commercial benefits to the Company. We continue to believe that DSR represents a potential breakthrough in the treatment of cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic-resistant heart failure  and look forward to resuming the MOJAVE study following completion of dedicated financing.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalInvestor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 (0) 797 342 9917Media Relations:Josephine GalatiotoICR HealthcareE: Sequana@icrhealthcare.comT: +1 (332) 242-4388DSR® therapy is still in development and is currently not approved in any country. The safety and effectiveness of DSR® therapy has not been established.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.About DSR  a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) and diuretic-resistant heart failureFluid overload in heart failure  AKA congestion  is a key clinical challenge. No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this clinical challenge.Congestion remains a key clinical challenge with US heart-failure related hospitalisation costs estimated at over $14 billion  and over 90% of these hospitalisations being due to congestion. Approximately 1 in 4 of these patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge due to the limitations of current therapy.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). These results were published in the European Journal of Heart Failure.Initial data from the initial cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response and improves cardio-renal health.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic resistant” patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients  while reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024  following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical’s POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada  the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1  2.Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025  CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1  2025.Results of the Company’s RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.3 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is dependent on securing additional financing.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Photograph: Alan Betson/The Irish TimesA Roscommon-based environmental software company will next week become the first business to list on Euronext Dublin’s “springboard” market for small enterprises.Senus  previously known as FarmEye  will begin trading on the exchange’s new Euronext Access market on Monday with an initial market value of €13.1 million  it said in a statement on Thursday. Its admission price per share has been set at almost €5.13.The company was founded by managing director Bernard Allen  Eoghan Finneran and Joe Desbonnet in 2017.Its proprietary so-called natural capital software is used to transform complex environmental data – spanning soil  air and water to habitats – into actionable sustainability plans for Governments  companies  farmers and landowners.Senus is currently providing its solutions to clients in Ireland  increasingly in the UK  and has an initial presence in mainland Europe. For the financial year to the end of June  Senus recorded revenue of €836 991  serving 138 customer accounts.The company has completed a private share placement  raising €1.1 million  in advance of the listing. Senus acquired a UK-based geospatial intelligence company called Loamin last month  which it described as a “highly complementary firm” with which it has partnered since 2022.Could the decision to spend most of next year’s corporation tax come back to bite the Government? Listen | 37:08“The Euronext Access market provides an ideal stepping stone for Senus to execute the next phase of our growth  leveraging our standing as a public company to build our profile and access capital to provide more enterprises with Senus’s natural capital management technology and software solutions ” said Gerry Keenan  chairman of Senus.Euronext  the pan-European stock market operator and owner of the Irish exchange  already operates Euronext Access markets in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon. Executives in Euronext Dublin completed development work on such a market in Ireland earlier this year.Euronext Access markets are designed especially for start-ups and small companies that wish to join a stock exchange to finance growth and gain the reputational advantages of listing but do not meet the criteria for admission to main or even junior Euronext Growth markets.The hope is that some companies joining a Euronext Access market could ultimately uplist to Euronext Growth or  in time  the main market.Rather than offering continuous trading in listed companies when the stock market is open – as with businesses listed on the junior or main market – Euronext Access markets hold two actions a day  at midday and the end of a session.Only three companies have floated in Dublin in the past six years. In that time  a number of companies have exited the market through take-private deals and decisions by former Iseq heavyweights CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock to ditch their Irish listings and move their main quotations to New York.Senus said that its listing will give the company an additional stock-based currency with which to make acquisitions of companies or complementary products  technologies  and distribution channels.“With eight years of R&D (research and development) and projects delivered Senus’s natural capital solutions are solving acute problems for our growing customer base on the ground every day ” said Mr Allen.“The Senus team is ideally positioned to pursue a significant emerging market opportunity  bringing the capabilities of our proprietary natural capital management software and technology solutions to a much broader international audience.”,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.3,0.38,0.32,True,English,"['first ‘springboard’ stock market listing', 'Roscommon firm', 'Euronext Dublin', 'A Roscommon-based environmental software company', 'proprietary natural capital management software', 'significant emerging market opportunity', 'natural capital management technology', 'UK-based geospatial intelligence company', 'pan-European stock market operator', 'The Euronext Access market', 'new Euronext Access market', 'natural capital software', 'junior Euronext Growth markets', 'complex environmental data', 'natural capital solutions', 'Euronext Access markets', 'actionable sustainability plans', 'ideal stepping stone', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'additional stock-based currency', 'broader international audience', 'The Irish Times', 'past six years', 'growing customer base', 'initial market value', 'The Senus team', 'private share placement', 'access capital', 'software solutions', 'New York', 'technology solutions', 'springboard” market', 'Euronext Dublin', 'initial presence', '138 customer accounts', 'private deals', 'eight years', 'main market', 'public company', 'Irish listings', 'stock exchange', 'Alan Betson', 'first business', 'managing director', 'Bernard Allen', 'Eoghan Finneran', 'Joe Desbonnet', 'mainland Europe', 'financial year', 'complementary firm', 'next year', 'corporation tax', 'next phase', 'Gerry Keenan', 'Irish exchange', 'reputational advantages', 'two actions', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'complementary products', 'distribution channels', 'R&D', 'acute problems', 'Mr Allen', 'main quotations', 'small companies', 'small enterprises', 'admission price', 'development work', 'continuous trading', 'listed companies', 'three companies', 'first listing', 'Photograph', 'FarmEye', 'Monday', 'statement', 'Thursday', 'soil', 'air', 'water', 'habitats', 'Governments', 'farmers', 'landowners', 'clients', 'Ireland', 'end', 'June', 'revenue', 'advance', 'decision', 'Listen', 'standing', 'profile', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'Executives', 'start-ups', 'criteria', 'hope', 'businesses', 'midday', 'session', 'number', 'CRH', 'acquisitions', 'technologies', 'research', 'projects', 'ground', 'capabilities']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,irishtimes.com

54409,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/18/3207985/0/en/SCOR-renews-its-contingent-capital-program.html,SCOR renews its contingent capital program,Press release18 December 2025 - N° 20      SCOR renews its contingent capital program  Disclaimer:   SCOR (hereafter “SCOR” or the “Company”) has...,"Press release18 December 2025 - N° 20SCOR renews its contingent capital programDisclaimer :SCOR (hereafter “SCOR” or the “Company”) has implemented a contingent capital program in the form of share subscription warrants with J.P. Morgan SE  which upon exercise of these warrants after having received the issued shares is not intended to remain a shareholder of the Company.The Company's ordinary shares  which would result from the exercise of the aforementioned share subscription warrants  will likely be sold on the market very shortly  which may create strong downward pressure on the Company's share price.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant decrease in the value of the Company's shares  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of the Company's ordinary shares which may be issued to the benefit of J.P. Morgan SE  as the sole subscriber of these share subscription warrants.The investors are invited to remain cautious before deciding to invest in the Company's ordinary shares that are admitted to trading  especially when such dilutive transactions are carried out successively. The Company recalls that this dilutive financing transaction is not unprecedented  as it represents the fifth renewal of its contingent capital program  first implemented in January 2011.Investors are specifically invited to review the risks associated with these transactions  as mentioned in the press release below. It should be noted  however  that the subscription of the warrants is reserved exclusively for J.P. Morgan SE.SCOR announces the renewal  for 3 years  of its contingent capital program which may provide the Group with additional capital of up to EUR 300 million upon the occurrence of extreme events (natural disasters or events affecting mortality) or a significant fall in the share price of the Company's ordinary shares.This solution aims to protect the equity and  consequently  the Group's solvency in such circumstances.The contingent capital program is based upon the issuance by SCOR of share subscription warrants  subscribed by J.P. Morgan SE  which will be automatically exercised in the cases specified in the warrant agreement (the ""2025 Warrants"").The coverage period for the contingent capital program starts from January 1  2026  to December 31  2028. In the absence of a triggering event during this period  the 2025 Warrants will not be exercised. The warrant agreement for the 2025 Warrants provides  among other things  for the benefit of the Company  an option for early termination of all or part of the 2025 Warrants in the event of a regulatory disqualification event  as well as an option for early termination of all 2025 Warrants on December 31 of each year  beginning on December 31  2026.The amount of the share capital increases resulting from the potential exercise of the 2025 Warrants could reach EUR 300 000 000 (including share premium)  providing that the dilution shall not exceed 10% of the share capital on the date of issuance of the ordinary shares resulting from the exercise of the 2025 Warrants. It being specified that the exercise of all the 2025 Warrants assumes the absence of exercise of the share issuance warrants issued on December 16  2022 which coverage period will expire on December 31  2025 (the ""2022 Warrants"")  the total number of new ordinary shares to be issued upon exercise of the 2022 and 2025 Warrants not exceeding 10% of the share capital on the date of issuance of said shares.** *Key Features of the Share Subscription WarrantsThe transaction will result in SCOR issuing 8 971 220 share subscription warrants to J.P. Morgan SE  each 2025 Warrant entitling J.P. Morgan SE to subscribe for two new SCOR ordinary shares up to a limit of 10% of the number of ordinary shares comprising the Company's share capital on the date of issue of said ordinary shares. The subscription price of each 2025 Warrant amounts to EUR 0.001  resulting in a total subscription price of EUR 8 971.22.Under the terms of the warrant agreement for the 2025 Warrants  J.P. Morgan SE has undertaken  subject to certain conditions  to exercise for all or part of the 2025 Warrants following the occurrence of natural or non-natural catastrophe-type events likely to have a significant impact on the Group's profitability or solvency  or a significant fall in the share price of the Company's ordinary shares  as described in more detail below  for a maximum amount of EUR 300 000 000 (including share premium). Drawdowns under the contingent capital program may be carried out in one or more tranches.Drawdowns under this program will only be available if:(1) the amount of estimated final net losses1 (as verified by SCOR's auditors) that SCOR may incur as insurer or reinsurer following the occurrence  during a given year between January 1  2026 to December 31  2028 (inclusive)  of one or more natural catastrophe-type events  reaches certain contractually predefined thresholds  including:earthquake  seaquake  earthquake shock  seismic and/or volcanic disturbance/eruption;hurricane  rainstorm  storm  tempest  tornado  cyclone  typhoon;tidal wave  tsunami  flood;hail  winter weather/freeze  ice storm  weight of snow  avalanche;meteor/asteroid impact; orlandslip  landslide  mudslide  bush fire  forest fire and lightning or if(2) the amount of net claims2 in the Group's life reinsurance business over two consecutive six-month periods during the period from July 1  2025 to December 31  2028 (inclusive) (as verified by SCOR's auditors) reaches certain predefined thresholds following the occurrence of  in particular  one or more of the following life events:deviation of epidemic  pandemic or a similar incidence or wide spread of one or more medical condition deriving from any disease(s);acts of war  acts of terrorism;accidents due to non-natural cause(s); ormaterial deviation from forecast biometric trends (mortality  morbidity  disability or longevity) recorded by the life segment for any reason whatsoever (including as a result of the events mentioned in (1) above).Furthermore  subject to no drawdown having already been implemented following the occurrence of a natural or non-natural disaster under this contingent capital program  if the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's ordinary shares observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market during a period of three (3) consecutive trading days between January 1  2026 and December 31  2028 (inclusive) is less than EUR 10 (i.e. a price level close to the nominal value of the SCOR shares)  a maximum amount of EUR 150 million  including share premium  will be drawn to ensure the availability of the financial cover (provided that the 2025 Warrants will not be exercised if the unit subscription price of the new ordinary shares issued upon exercise of the 2025 Warrants is below their par value) in the event of the occurrence of a natural or non-natural catastrophe-type events during the remaining period of the risk coverage period.The 2025 Warrants will remain exercisable for three months after the end of the risk coverage period (subject to certain periods of postponement and/or extension  in particular for regulatory reasons).In accordance with the authorization granted by the combined shareholders’ meeting of SCOR dated April 29  2025  the maximum number of new shares issued in the event of exercise of the 2025 Warrants may not exceed 10% of SCOR's share capital on the date of issue of said ordinary shares.All new shares will be subscribed by J.P. Morgan SE at a price equal to the volume-weighted average price of SCOR shares on Euronext Paris during the three trading days preceding the exercise of the warrants. Given the automatic nature of the drawdowns resulting from this contingent share issuance facility and the guarantee that such automaticity provides the Company to access the proceeds of the corresponding issuance should it require hedging  a discount of 7.5% will be applied  provided that the 2025 Warrants will not be exercised if the unit subscription price of the new ordinary shares issued upon exercise of the 2025 Warrants is below their par value. This price will be rounded down to the nearest thousandth of a euro.J.P. Morgan SE has committed to subscribe to the new shares issued upon exercise of the 2025 Warrants  but does not intend to become a long-term shareholder of SCOR and will sell its shares through private placements and/or market sales. In this regard  SCOR and J.P. Morgan SE have entered into a profit-sharing agreement  which provides that 75% of any profit will be shared with SCOR. If the sale of the new shares is completed immediately after the exercise of the 2025 Warrants in an off-market transaction  SCOR's share of the profit will be paid in the form of SCOR shares to limit the dilutive impact of the transaction on SCOR shareholders.It is specified that from the date of notification of the occurrence of one of the aforementioned triggering events by SCOR to J.P. Morgan SE and until the exercise of the 2025 Warrants  the trading desk of J.P. Morgan SE responsible for managing its market risk in respect of the 2025 Warrants will be prohibited from entering into hedging transactions on SCOR shares  with the exception of standard transactions entered into independently within the context of the banking and brokerage activities of J.P. Morgan SE and its affiliates.By way of illustration :(a) Under current market conditions (i.e. for an issue price of EUR 25.56 per share based on a 7.5% discount applied to the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's ordinary shares observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market during the three (3) consecutive trading days preceding the issue date3 of 27.63 euros per share)  the drawing down of the entire cover (EUR 300 million) would represent a maximum of 6.54% of SCOR's share capital4.(b) In the event that a single tranche of EUR 150 million were drawn down due to the fall in the SCOR share price  based on a volume-weighted average price of the Company's ordinary shares observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market over a period of three (3) consecutive trading days of EUR 10 per share (i.e. for an issue price of EUR 9.25 per share after a 7.5% discount)  the transaction would represent 9.04% of the SCOR's share capital5.Given these theoretical dilution levels and the fact that the number of new shares that may be issued upon exercise of the 2025 Warrants is limited to 10% of SCOR's share capital on the date of said issuance  the implementation of this contingent share issuance program does not require a prospectus approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”). If the contingent capital program is triggered  SCOR will disclose to the market the relevant information in accordance with the applicable regulations at the time of the drawdown or issuance of the new shares regarding the circumstances of the issuance  the amount of the drawdown  the issue price  the number of shares issued  and the consequences of such an issuance for its shareholders.The 2025 Warrants will not be listed.J.P Morgan SE may not sell or transfer the 2025 Warrants except (i) with the Company’s prior written consent  or (ii) within the group of J.P. Morgan SE  provided that such transferee entity satisfies the conditions set by the twenty-sixth resolution of the combined shareholders’ meeting of April 29  2025  or (iii) to the offeror of a tender offer for the SCOR’s securities provided that such tender offer is successful and is reopened pursuant to the General Regulation of the AMF (Règlement général de l’Autorité des marchés financiers).This transaction will have no impact on SCOR's 2025 accounts due to the insignificant subscription amount received by SCOR from J.P. Morgan SE at the time of the warrant issuance (0.001 euro per 2025 Warrants).Rationale for the transaction and financing horizonThis financial hedge is a contingent share issuance facility  which can only be triggered if the triggering events described above occur. Its potential dilutive impact therefore depends on the probability of occurrence of such events and the share price at the time of the triggering event.SCOR's management believes that this contingent capital solution provides its shareholders with a significant net economic benefit  insofar as it compares favorably with traditional retrocessions and ILS insurance securities and allows SCOR to improve the resilience of its balance sheet while optimizing its risk protection costs with a limited potential dilutive impact.Over the past 24 months  with the exception of new share issuances resulting from the exercise of stock options  the Company has not carried out any dilutive transactions.The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Warrants amount to EUR 8 971.22  corresponding to 8 971 220 2025 Warrants with a par value of €0.001 each. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Warrants are not linked to any specific strategy and will be used for general corporate purposes.DilutionImpact of the issuance of the 2025 Warrants (and of their partial or full exercise) on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital  as recorded on November 30  2025  and calculated on the basis of the volume-weighted average closing price (VWAP) of the Company's ordinary shares observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market over three (3) consecutive trading days preceding the issuance of the 2025 Warrants.Shareholder participation (in %) Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance 1.000% 0.985% After issuance of 16 216 216 new shares corresponding to the partial exercise of the 2025 Warrants following the satisfaction of the price condition (2) 0.917% 0.905% After issuance of 11 738 024 new shares corresponding to the full exercise of the 2025 Warrants following the occurrence of a natural or non-natural disaster (3) 0.939% 0.925%(1) Assuming the exercise of all 2 716 078 outstanding stock options as at November 30  2025  whether exercisable or not  and giving rights to 2 716 078 new shares of the Company. The exercise of all 2025 Warrants assumes that the 2022 Warrants will not be exercised  and the total number of new ordinary shares to be issued upon exercise of the 2022 and 2025 Warrants cannot exceed 10% of the share capital on the date of issuance of said shares.(2) Assuming the exercise of EUR 150 million of the 2025 Warrants in the event that the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's ordinary shares observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market during a period of three (3) consecutive trading days between January 1  2026 and December 31  2028 (inclusive) would be less than EUR 10.(3) Assuming the exercise of EUR 300 million of the 2025 Warrants in a single tranche should a hedging need arise due to natural disasters occurring between January 1  2026  and December 31  2028 (inclusive)  or non-natural disasters occurring between July 1  2025  and December 31  2028 (inclusive)  which in each case could have a significant impact on the Group's profitability or solvency. The full exercise of the 2025 Warrants in a single tranche excludes any prior partial exercise of the 2025 Warrants under the market price condition.Impact of the issuance of the 2025 Warrants (and of their partial or full exercise) on the participation of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital  as recorded on November 30  2025  and calculated on the basis of an issue price equal to the unit nominal value of EUR 7.8769723 per ordinary share of the Company6 (value below which no issuance can take place except by reducing the nominal value).Shareholder participation (in %) Non-diluted basis Diluted Basis (1) Before issuance 1.000% 0.985% After issuance of 17 942 440 new shares corresponding to the partial exercise of the 2025 Warrants following the satisfaction of the share price condition (2) 0.909% 0.897% After issuance of 17 942 440 new shares corresponding to the full exercise of the 2025 Warrants following the occurrence of a natural or non-natural disaster (2) (3) 0.909% 0.897%(1) Assuming the exercise of all 2 716 078 outstanding stock options as at November 30  2025  whether exercisable or not  and giving rights to 2 716 078 new shares of the Company. The full exercise of the 2025 Warrants assumes that the 2022 Warrants are not exercised  as the total number of new ordinary shares to be issued upon exercise of the 2022 Warrants and the 2025 Warrants may not exceed 10% of the share capital as of the date of issuance of such shares.(2) The impact of the issuance of ordinary shares resulting from the exercise of the 2025 Warrants on the holding of a shareholder owning 1% of the Company’s share capital as at November 30  2025 is identical in the event of a partial or full exercise of the 2025 Warrants  since the dilution cap (i.e.  10% of the share capital as of the date of issuance of such shares) would be reached in both cases  assuming that the issue price of the ordinary shares resulting from the exercise of the 2025 Warrants is equal to the nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares.(3) Assuming the exercise of EUR 300 million of the 2025 Warrants in a single tranche should a hedging need arise due to natural disasters occurring between January 1  2026  and December 31  2028 (inclusive)  or non-natural disasters occurring between July 1  2025  and December 31  2028 (inclusive)  which in each case could have a significant impact on the Group's profitability or solvency. The full exercise of the 2025 Warrants in a single tranche excludes any prior partial exercise of the 2025 Warrants under the market price condition.Presentation of the intermediary and the commissions/benefits received in connection with the transactionJ.P.

CARBIOS remains fully committed to the commercialization of licenses for its technology  and following the successful contract with Wankai  ambitions to sign other licenses in Europe  North America and South America.Clermont-Ferrand (France)  18 December 2025 (6:30 p.m. CET). CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB) reaffirms its ambition to pursue the Longlaville plant construction project  by rescheduling the timeline with a three-month adjustment.In 2025  CARBIOS signed pre-commercialization contracts covering close to 50% of the production capacity of the future industrial site in Longlaville and is working to secure commitments to reach 70% in the near term. These multiple commercial agreements concluded in the cosmetics  beverage  and tire textile filament industries  confirm the strong market traction for biorecycled PET produced using the technology designed and developed by CARBIOS.The pre-commercialization progress has been instrumental in driving forward the structuring of the financing needed to resume construction project of this first PET biorecycling plant in France and to cover the main portion required to finance the plant project3. It is expected that the plant will be financially independent from CARBIOS (non-recourse financing on CARBIOS.)The financing of this industrial project is based on private financing (debt and equity) and on confirmed public aid amounting to 42.5 million euros.A small portion1 of the financing still needs to be secured before the project can move forward. CARBIOS aims to achieve this by the end of the first quarter of 2026. If this is the case  the plant should be commissioned during the first half of 2028.CARBIOS remains fully committed to commercializing licenses for its technology  with an initial strategic partnership agreement signed on 2 December 2025 with Wankai New Materials to deploy its PET biorecycling technology in Asia4. In addition  the Company aims to commercialize new licenses in Europe  as well as in North and South America.###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotechnology company that develops and industrializes biological solutions to reinvent the lifecycle of plastics and textiles.

Inflation has continued to edge lower across advanced economies  yet interest rates remain firmly in restrictive territory  reinforcing the view that any policy easing will be cautious and uneven. Economic growth has softened without breaking  leaving investors to navigate a late-cycle environment marked by slower demand  tighter financial conditions and limited tolerance for mispricing.Across currencies and commodities  price action remains closely tied to geopolitics  fiscal dynamics and trade policy  generating intermittent volatility. The dominant theme is not renewed stress  but a narrowing margin for error  as markets adapt to a world of lower growth  constrained liquidity and more exacting scrutiny of risk.Digital currency markets have matured further  with institutional participation deepening amid clearer regulation  steadier infrastructure and a shift in focus from speculation toward custody  tokenisation and real-world applications.Set against this backdrop  Pan Finance’s Q4 edition turns its focus to the forces reshaping money  capital and confidence in the global financial system. With digital assets moving steadily into the institutional mainstream  the question of how  and how far  digital currencies could disrupt traditional banking models sits at the centre of this quarter’s debate. Our cover story  Could Digital Currencies End Banking As We Know It? The Uncertain Future of Money  examines whether innovation is driving structural change or reinforcing existing hierarchies. The issue also grounds this discussion in economic reality. New data underscores the enduring dominance of the US dollar  even as alternatives gain visibility. We explore why corporate investment remains subdued despite easing inflation  and assess the environmental footprint of banking  from capital allocation to the often-overlooked role depositors play. Finally  we examine the quiet retreat of banks from climate commitments  asking whether this signals strategic recalibration or a broader shift in priorities as financial conditions tighten.Furthermore  Pan Finance continues to shine a spotlight on a variety of topics by highlighting leading examples of best practice across the financial services sector and beyond. Established to be a true measure of excellence  the Pan Finance awards look beyond the realm of the balance sheet alone  measuring success through innovation  stewardship of the environment and positive impact on society.Rosie McCollin  Executive Vice President  Vistra Fund Solutions  stated  ""Being named Fund Solutions Provider of the Year 2025 means a great deal to us. It reflects the discipline  depth and consistency our teams bring to every mandate  and the care they take in supporting clients through increasingly complex demands. In a market where scrutiny is rising and expectations are higher than ever  we remain committed to setting a standard the industry can rely on.”“Winning this award is a tremendous honor for our team at Chargeback Gurus ” said Tim Tynan  CEO of Chargeback Gurus. “It validates our commitment to helping merchants protect their revenue and deliver leading technology driven chargeback prevention and recovery solutions. We're grateful to Pan Finance for this recognition and excited to continue driving excellence in our industry.”Storm Duncan  Founder & Managing Partner said: ""Being recognized by Pan Finance as Best M&A Advisor for Tech Companies in North America is deeply meaningful to our team because it affirms how we define success: by measuring the outcomes we deliver for our clients rather than for ourselves.

The pre-specified threshold of statistical significance was set at 10% (α=0.1). GLPG3667 also showed meaningful clinical improvements compared to placebo on several secondary endpoints of disease activity  including TIS20  TIS40  TIS60 and m-CDASI-A2. GLPG3667 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile throughout the 24-week treatment period.“The results from the GALARISSO study demonstrate that GLPG3667 has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients living with dermatomyositis  a debilitating autoimmune disease with limited therapeutic alternatives ” said Prof. Dr. Rohit Aggarwal  University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). “Furthermore  the improvements in patients’ disease activity observed in the study are encouraging. We look forward to further analyzing the data  including the long-term follow-up study with GLPG3667 in this indication.”In the GALACELA SLE study  GLPG3667  administered once daily at 75 mg (N=59) and 150 mg (N= 64) in addition to standard-of-care therapy  the primary endpoint analysis of dose-response on SLE responder index (SRI)-4 at Week 32 did not meet statistical significance. However  GLPG3667 showed numerical improvements over placebo (N=63) on several secondary endpoints  particularly on skin-related outcomes. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies with GLPG3667. The GALACELA study is currently ongoing  and the final Week 48 data  expected in the second quarter of 2026  will be essential to assess the totality of the evidence and determine potential next steps for the SLE program.Commenting on the topline results  Henry Gosebruch  CEO of Galapagos  said: “The positive results from the GALARISSO study in patients with dermatomyositis further validate the anti-inflammatory potential of our selective TYK2 inhibitor  consistent with findings from our earlier Phase 1b psoriasis study and supportive in vitro pharmacology. We are encouraged by the favorable safety profile observed to date  which may contribute to the differentiated profile of GLPG3667. As part of our ongoing efforts to maximize the value of this program for both patients and Galapagos  we are evaluating all strategic options. These include resuming potential partnering discussions announced earlier this year to accelerate development in dermatomyositis  as well as exploring opportunities to expand into other severe autoimmune diseases with significant unmet medical need.”The Company aims to present data at an upcoming medical conference.Gilead agreed to temporarily waive certain rights under the 10-year global Option  License and Collaboration Agreement between Galapagos and Gilead  enabling Galapagos to pursue external partnership opportunities for GLPG3667.About GLPG3667  the GALARISSO (NCT: 05695950) and GALACELA (NCT: 05856448) studiesGLPG3667 is an investigational reversible and selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) kinase domain inhibitor currently being evaluated in two Phase 3-enabling studies for dermatomyositis (DM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE.GALARISSO is a Phase 3-enabling randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLPG3667. A daily oral administration of GLPG3667 150 mg or placebo is being investigated in adult patients with DM over 24 weeks. At Week 24  patients have been offered the possibility to enter a long-term extension study for an additional 24-week period where they will all receive GLPG3667 150 mg daily (once a day). The primary endpoint is the Total Improvement Score (TIS) at Week 24 according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. The secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 24 are the proportion of patients who achieve at least minimal improvement according to the ACR/EULAR criteria  the change from baseline in Modified-Cutaneous DM Disease Area and Severity Index Activity Score (m-CDASI-A)  the change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)  and the change from baseline in the Manual Muscle Test (MMT-8).GALACELA is a Phase 3-enabling randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy  safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of GLPG3667 in adults with active SLE. Two once-daily oral doses of GLPG3667 (75 mg and 150 mg) or placebo are being investigated in adult patients with SLE for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve the SLE responder index (SRI)-4 response at Week 32. The secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of patients who achieve SRI-4 response at Week 48  the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response at Weeks 32 and 48  proportion of patients with >=50% reduction in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Activity (CLASI-A) score at Weeks 32 and 48  proportion of patients who achieve Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) at Weeks 32 and 48 and change from baseline in the 28-joint count for tender  swollen  and tender and swollen (active) joints at Weeks 32 and 48.About Dermatomyositis (DM)Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogenous group of rare autoimmune disorders primarily affecting the proximal muscles. They are characterized by severe muscle weakness  muscle enzyme elevations  inflammation on muscle biopsy  and extra-muscular manifestations. DM is the most common form of IIM and is characterized by inflammatory and degenerative changes of the muscles and skin. Early symptoms of DM include distinct skin manifestations accompanying or preceding muscle weakness. The quality of life (QoL) of patients with DM is impaired due to muscle weakness  pain and skin disease activity.3 The overall mortality ratio in DM patients also remains three times higher when compared to the general population; with cancer  lung  and cardiac complications and infections being the most common causes of death.4 DM-specific prevalence has been estimated at one to six per 100 000 adults in the United States  and a recent analysis of 3 067 patients in the Euromyositis registry identified DM in 31% of the sampled patients.5 DM is a rare disease and with only one currently approved treatment  there is a high unmet need for alternative safe and effective treatment options.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)SLE is a chronic  inflammatory  autoimmune disease affecting nearly every organ system and thereby one of the most heterogeneous illnesses treated by physicians.6 The pathogenesis of SLE is characterized by a global loss of self-tolerance with activation of autoreactive T and B cells. This leads to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that primarily target a variety of nuclear antigens  deposit in tissues and activate complement  resulting in organ damage. SLE affects women more frequently than men and is more prevalent and severe (with higher disease activity and more damage accrual) in non-Caucasian populations (Hispanics  African descendants  and Asians).7 SLE has periods of relatively stable disease followed by flares that may induce irreversible organ damage. Despite best practice  most patients accrue irreversible organ damage within 7 years of diagnosis. SLE has no cure and current treatment options are associated with partial efficacy and/or substantial toxicities. New treatments may help to fulfill the current unmet medical needs among patients.GLPG3667 is an investigational drug and not approved by any regulatory authority.

Unfortunately  in today’s note I cannot help but begin with the violent incident involving MEP Nikos Pappas and journalist Nikos Giannopoulos  whom the former punched and kicked in front of a stunned crowd at a restaurant in Strasbourg. This is not the first time that this particular guy—a classic thug and nothing more—has used violence; perhaps in previous instances it was only verbal. Therefore  Tsipras  who put him there  and Famelos  who had him in his party  are absolutely accountable to public opinion for the behavior of their MEP. And of course  a long time ago—given what he was saying (some tough-guy talk of the type that he would throw… peinirli  meaning bombs) and generally with everything he does—he should not have been an MEP. Let us hope that the European authorities will function better than the Greek ones.FarmersLet’s move on now to current affairs. The bras de fer with the farmers continues; I will tell you a bit more about it below  but before that let me give you the news: with a special digital application that farmers and fuel station owners will download on their smartphones  the refund of the excise duty (EFC) on agricultural diesel will be carried out directly at the pump. The competent ministries are working intensively to prepare the relevant application  which will leave no back door open to smuggling phenomena. According to information from this column  data will be drawn from the AADE database regarding the exact quantity of fuel used by each farmer last year. These are the data on the basis of which the refund of the special tax is in any case made retroactively. Subsequently  the digital application will contain the individualized data of each farmer; that is  the total quantity of fuel to which they are entitled. Each time they fill up the tractor or their agricultural machinery with diesel  the corresponding quantity will be deducted from the total via scanning the QR codes of the applications held by the farmer and the fuel station owner.Near heart attacks and solutionsAs yesterday dawned for the government  a number of officials at the Vice-Presidency and at the Ministry of Agricultural Development almost dropped dead over the mistake that was made whereby the farmers’ money was withdrawn for ELGA contributions before they were paid. “I almost had a stroke ” I am told Minister Tsiaras said to a colleague of his. In any case  after painstaking efforts all payments were made  and correctly  by OPEKEPE and ELGA  and by the end of the day the farmers received the money they were supposed to receive. However  already-damaged trust was clipped yet again  and the extremists once more took the lead at the “blockades.” On the other hand  the government also resolved the issue with ATAK for the fields of farmers from Serres  and they too will now be paid. Of course  the question now is whether they will go to dialogue  although the government estimates that there is no footing for not going. In any event  if the hard line prevails at the blockades  the government will readjust its stance—just so you know.Increases in EYDAP tariffs decided todayAccording to information  today  Thursday  RAAEY is scheduled to meet in order to approve increases in EYDAP tariffs. According to the same information  the increase is estimated to be around 2 to 3 euros per month  per meter. If confirmed today  the increase is estimated to concern approximately 3.5 million connections  as 1 million connections relating to socially vulnerable groups will be excluded.ELGA and AIK.M. casually invited ND MPs yesterday and  admittedly  the atmosphere was good  without many unpleasant remarks. I am told that in some small groups there was discussion about agricultural issues  and that ND MP Andreas Katsaniotis also had a discussion with Mitsotakis  telling him that AI should be applied at ELGA  and that agronomists should be hired to carry out on-site inspections. Katsaniotis  meanwhile  is the MP who raises the most objections to bringing OPEKEPE under AADE  but he will vote normally and will speak today in Parliament  even though he wanted to leave for France and be present at the delivery of the first Belharra together with Dendias. And he will point out that he is voting so that there will be control over payments from now on.Tie – FrigateThe Speaker of Parliament  Nikitas Kaklamanis  “stole the show ” gifting the prime minister a tie with frigates on it  with Kyriakos Mitsotakis replying that he will wear it at their delivery  while the countdown is on for the first frigate  the “Kimon ” to sail toward Greece.An end to New Year wishesIn his private meeting with K.M.  Tasoulas informed him that he is abolishing the submission of wishes. What is the submission of wishes? Every year  after the New Year Doxology at the Holy Metropolis of Athens  where the President of the Republic is present  it is traditionally followed by the submission of wishes to the President at the Presidential Mansion by the political leadership as well as other official figures. Tasoulas is abolishing it as of this year  a ceremony that had been followed uninterruptedly since the era of the monarchy. For what reason? First  officials submit their wishes at the Metropolis. Why then go afterward to the Presidential Mansion to submit their wishes again? Second  the President of the Republic considers that this ceremony had in any case effectively abolished itself  since in recent years 360 people were invited and about 90 went to the Presidential Mansion. “The Presidency of the Republic must function in a less pompous manner ” Tasoulas said to K.M.  who of course did not disagree.Mitsotakis in DavosThe World Economic Forum  which is the organizer of the annual major Davos forum  informed yesterday via a post that among the invitees of this year’s forum (January 19–23) will be Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Indeed  in the same post it also publishes the link through which its followers can watch the discussion that Kyriakos Mitsotakis had in Davos in 2024 on the topic “Achieving Security and Cooperation in a Fragmented World.” At this year’s Davos forum session  things will be very different for Greece  which is making a major return  as also shown by the recognition of the country’s progress with the election of Kyriakos Pierrakakis to the presidency of the Eurogroup.Zoe  reality TV  and the “shadows”I don’t think anyone disagrees that every appearance of Zoe Konstantopoulou at the Parliamentary Investigative Committee on OPEKEPE turns the process into the best judicial reality show since the establishment of Greek television. However  in recent hours some are raising various “shadows” on the occasion of complaints by New Democracy about the operation of an NGO that is directly linked to her and her party. Possibly  of course  she herself above all must give sufficient answers and shut mouths. I must  however  admit that her initial reaction—in which she rushed to downgrade the company to a simple “educational body”—was somewhat… incomplete. Unless  of course  the company constitutes the lawful “vehicle” for the collection of state subsidies that all parties receive for educational purposes.Justice for AllFor those who do not know the issue  let me explain. Last week a request for the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the party president was forwarded to Parliament. The file was formed following a lawsuit by a journalist for defamatory libel. From the content of the lawsuit it was ascertained that this journalist was working at the Civil Non-Profit Company (AMKE) “Justice for All” and was being paid through the issuance of electronic invoices. In total she had collected in 2024 approximately €40 000  while  as the complainant claims  about €16 000 in accrued wages are owed to her. As the address of the AMKE  “Vatatzi 6” in Exarchia is declared  which is also the address of the offices of the party Course of Freedom – Zoe Konstantopoulou. The relationship between company  party  and Zoe is in any case confirmed by the open data of GEMI. In the administration of the company  which was established on 17.12.2020  the following are listed as “active” members: the political party Course of Freedom  Apostolos Balmpouzis as member-manager  and Zoe Konstantopoulou as partner-member.The questions of NDUp to this point everything is fine  as the parliamentary office is not incompatible with the capacity of a simple member of a company  provided of course that it does not contract with the State. ND  however  raises various questions  such as for example whether the said company receives projects from the State—and whether the president declares her participation in her assets declaration (pothen esches). In any case  from an initial detailed look I took at the available asset declarations for fiscal years 2021  2022  and 2023  the president declares only her participation in the law firm she has with her father.Papachelas documentaryLet me write one opinion  without… claiming infallibility  about the divergence of views created by the partial state funding (within the framework in which dozens of series are subsidized) that was to be given to a documentary by Papachelas (SKAI) about 17N  in which Koufontinas would speak. I fully understand the sensitivity of the relatives of the victims  but in Western countries journalists record everyone. Including the murderers. It is neither the first nor the last time that—especially in historical documentaries—the viewpoint of the killer is “heard ” whether he is a common criminal  a terrorist  or whether he is unrepentant or remorseful. I also believe that from this particular documentary the only loser would have been Koufontinas himself  because public opinion would once again bring to mind his heinous crimes.The Credia Bank – Pantelakis Securities deal closedLet’s move on to business news with the agreement that was closed for the acquisition of Pantelakis Securities by Credia Bank. The due diligence at the brokerage was completed  the board of Credia Bank gave the green light for the transaction on Tuesday  and yesterday the staff of the brokerage were informed by the shareholders about the sale. Logically  and barring the unforeseen  the relevant announcements should be made today as the agreement for exclusive negotiations is signed. E. Vrettou is moving at a fast pace for the development of the bank  adding—after the acquisition of HSBC Malta—the brokerage activity to the group. Credia Bank acquires a new revenue-concentration sector  while for the brokerage and its employees it is also a positive development  as other growth prospects are created. Pantelakis Securities had profitability on the order of €1 million and a turbulent sea ahead of it due to Euronext. The transaction does not include asset management  which has a different shareholding structure. Information speaks of a price in the region of €15 million—half in shares  half in cash. A large part of the consideration will be paid immediately  but for the next three years earn-out payments linked to targets are also provided for. The Euronext era is particularly difficult for non-bank brokerage firms  which must have strong capital adequacy (€5 million) to participate in the market  double capital strength to be active in the derivatives market  and a multiple capital base to be active in the bond market as well.The next acquisition concerns an Asset Management companyIn the current environment  banks are recording high profitability. Dividend distribution is subject to SSM restrictions (up to 50% of net profits)  therefore the remainder must be utilized through acquisitions of healthy businesses that will add value to each bank’s portfolio  together with the possibility of cross selling (leveraging the customer base). Market information indicates that the next acquisition by a large systemic bank sitting on a pile of liquidity will concern a company operating in a sector where the bank is lagging. That of asset management  which  as Greek society “matures ” appears to be a sector that promises strong growth. The track record of the company to be acquired is impressively positive  something that is also evident from the glamorous Christmas parties it organizes every year around this time.Top-level changes at NovaWe had management changes with a strong imprint at Nova. Nikos Stathopoulos stepped down from the position of Chairman of the Board at NOVA Telecommunications & Media to give his seat to Stanley Miller  CEO of United Group  Nova’s parent company. Miller replaced Victoria Boklag last June and took the helm of the UN group  having previously served  among other roles  as CEO of KPN Mobile. The company has set as priorities investments in the 5G network  infrastructure for the new FWA products  and the development of its proprietary fiber-optic network (FTTH)  as well as the expansion of its pay-TV subscriber base  but also further development and expansion in the B2B corporate customers market and ICT projects. For last year’s fiscal period it announced its financial results a few days ago  according to which total revenues increased by 7.6%  reaching €881.5 million in 2024. Revenues in the ICT projects sector reached €86.8 million in 2024 compared to €30.6 million in 2023  marking a significant increase of 184%  as the company undertook an increased number of large-scale projects mainly related to digital transformation. EBITDA reached €314 million (+7%)  while the net loss for 2024 amounted to €47 million  compared with a loss of €45.4 million in the previous year.Swiss franc borrowers and TeiresiasThe ordeal of Swiss franc borrowers is well known  as from 2010 to 2025 the exchange rate of the Swiss franc against the euro increased by approximately 45%  which means that although interest over such a period has been paid off  this does not hold true since the loan principal remains unchanged due to the appreciation of the currency. There is one more issue pending in relation to the regulation: whether or not Swiss franc borrowers who will be included in the regulation—which will likely be submitted to Parliament even today—will be reported to Teiresias. Any regulation of loans based on legislation implies an inability to pay on the part of the borrower relative to the original loan agreement and leads to registration with Teiresias. If and when the loan is serviced normally and becomes performing over time  that record ceases to exist. As regards Swiss franc loans  stakeholders involved in the matter note that in most cases they concern borrowers who have carried out more than one restructuring and are already listed with Teiresias. There are  however  borrowers who are not listed with Teiresias because they service their loan normally without having previously restructured it. For these cases  it is likely that provision will be made so that these specific borrowers will not be registered with Teiresias due to the regulation that the ministry has “built” for them.Odysseas’ surprise in Lamda’s resultsYesterday the Lamda Development share once again surpassed the price of €7 and a market capitalization of €1.24 billion; the company is announcing its 9M 2025 results today. The market expects a continuation of the impressive course recorded in the first half  where operating profits quadrupled to €237 million. Eurobank Equities forecasts EBITDA of €115 million and net profits of €125 million versus losses of €14 million last year. The secret in today’s announcements by Odysseas Athanasiou may lie in the revaluation of the real estate portfolio—by €95 million—which reflects the explosive increase in demand as well as in property prices at Ellinikon. Essentially  this is the accounting recognition of goodwill that already exists  as prices in Little Athens have reached €7 600–7 700 per sq.m.  exceeding initial estimates by 30%–40%. If and when the information is confirmed  the share’s NAV is strengthened. In addition  the four shopping centers are recording records with 99% occupancy  while the two malls under construction have pre-agreed 63%–69% of leases at prices higher than existing ones.OPAP and the impatient onesA surprise—but not without explanation—was the behavior of the OPAP share yesterday on the Athens Stock Exchange. The decision  following feedback from the investment community  to include within the deal with Allwyn the issuance of preferred shares that would have enhanced rights  was expected by the market to extend the upward streak of recent days for the share. Instead  there were pressures and the OPAP share closed trading with losses of 2.1% and returned to €18  having a daily high of €18.61. What happened: Brokers report that a number of portfolios had positioned themselves in the share at lower prices  close to €17  betting on voting down at the upcoming General Meeting (on 7/1) the proposed merger with Allwyn and being paid the cash consideration of €19.04 per share  the so-called “exit right.” These portfolios now appear to be exiting because  as brokers explain  shareholders who exercise the exit right of €19.04 per share will have their shares and capital locked from the date of exercising the right (i.e.  from January 7) until the payment date  which is expected after 3–4 months. Also  the interim dividend of €0.80 that has been announced to be distributed after the completion of the transaction will be given only to shareholders who do not choose the exit right. In practice  investors are leaving the share who did not position themselves based on the significant prospects created by the merger  but who sought a “safe” profit with a short-term horizon.The Stock Exchange in a tug-of-warWith 16 alternations in the sign of the General Index  Wednesday’s session took place on the Athens Stock Exchange  balancing between one group of shares that came under strong pressure and another group that continued to outperform. Selectivity is due in part to the fact that several investors have closed their books for this year  already having their eyes set on 2026. As for the positive protagonists  Metlen managed to stage a rebound and  with gains of 2%  put an end to the three-day downward streak. Titan extended its all-time record by surpassing €48  while ElvalHalcor came within a “breath” of the 18-year high of €4. At the same time  AVAX recorded a jump of over 4% and closed at a new 16-year high. Among the negative protagonists  we find Eurobank once again  which continued for a second consecutive session in sharply negative territory and with a large volume of block trades. OPAP was also in the “red ” retreating by more than 2%.The icon KimThat Kimberly Guilfoyle is a celebrity  you have understood. The point is that when you experience her up close  you grasp it in its full dimension. Then you realize that she is an icon resembling a pop star. Two days ago she made an appearance at the AMVER Awards event  co-organized as every year by the Propeller Club Port of Piraeus  with president Kostis Fragkoulis  together with the U.S. Embassy. AMVER is a United States Coast Guard system in which countries from all over the world participate with the aim of rescuing people in danger at sea. Moving on. Wherever Kim appears  pandemonium ensues  to the extent that they don’t even let her eat. “The other day she went to eat a spoonful of soup and a lady came up to her and persistently asked to take a photo ” I was told. As a result  her security team now forms a cordon around the table where she sits and deters the indiscreet. Kim  of course  remains friendly and does not refuse photographs to anyone  but within a framework of rules of courtesy and discretion.Maria Angelicoussis sweeps the awards in shippingYou could also call her the person of the month. Maria Angelicoussis  head of the Angelicoussis Group  came to the forefront of publicity during December. It began with her award  at the beginning of the month  as Personality of the Year by the Greek Shipping Awards  a distinction which—as the jury stated—rewards her leadership  integrity  and active contribution to shaping the future of the sector. This was followed by her ranking in eighth place in Lloyd’s List’s Top 100 of the most influential personalities in global shipping  above all the Greek presences  which this year totaled 17. And two days ago  her group was honored as the top company in participation at the AMVER Awards with 1 027 vessels over the 10-year period 2016–2025  as well as for the year 2024 with 130 vessels.TEN: The Greek shipping company running the marathon of energy marketsFrom New York  Dr. Nikos Tsakos  founder and CEO of Tsakos Energy Navigation (TEN)  sent a clear message: in energy markets  geopolitical developments set the rules of the game  and he commented: “Investors who follow Wall Street must understand that TEN is not a ‘simple shipping company’ but an energy infrastructure company with stable revenue streams and strategic alliances.” The company recorded 96% fleet utilization  stable profits  and a share price increase of almost 40% during 2025  with an enhanced dividend. Its secret? Long-term partnerships with energy giants such as Exxon  Chevron  Total  and Equinor  which ensure payments without delays and protection from short-term turbulence. In practice  TEN defies the usual market reactions: falling oil prices often “punish” the stock  while in reality they increase transport volumes. Seventy percent of the balance sheet is supported by 6–7 major energy groups  ensuring stability and protection from geopolitical shocks. As Tsakos emphasizes  “shipping is not a sprint but a marathon.”Behind the scenes of the Commission: Green transition of shipping or competitive defeatIntense behind-the-scenes activity and clear messages from the EU on the future of European shipping were sent from Brussels in the context of the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA). Fotini Ioannidou  Director at the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport  and Apostolos Tzitzikostas  European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism  signaled through their statements a common strategic line: the green transition is not negotiable and the competitiveness of European shipping remains a top priority. F. Ioannidou did not avoid reference to the recent October deadlock at the IMO regarding the Net Zero framework. Disappointment was evident  but the message was clear: Europe is not going to wait  and the transition is a one-way road. She analyzed the Commission’s plans for the Maritime Industrial Strategy and the Strategy for European Ports  focusing on safety  decarbonization  digitalization  and strengthening the human factor. The creation of a European maritime cluster that will operate complementarily across the entire chain is considered a central objective. On the same wavelength  the Commissioner stressed that “competitiveness is my absolute priority for all transport sectors  and especially for shipping.” He acknowledged the sector’s concerns about excessive regulation  committing to simplification and deregulation where possible  so that European shipping companies can operate efficiently without unnecessary administrative burdens. Regarding the green transition  he underlined that the EU will fully align its policies with the future global framework of the IMO. “Without an internationally accepted system of rules ” he stressed  “European shipping risks losing its competitive advantage in a globalized market.” This approach strengthens the prospect of the EU remaining a pioneer in the adoption of new fuels and technologies  turning the challenges of the green transition into opportunities for growth and innovation.Nasdaq asked the SEC to establish 24-hour stock tradingThe Nasdaq Stock Exchange submitted an official request to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the establishment of 24-hour stock trading. In reality  it proposes 23 hours of trading and one hour for clearing—or  more precisely  it proposes two sessions each day. It is obvious that the Nasdaq market faces fierce competition from crypto platforms that operate continuously  while at the same time it is losing revenue as significant transactions shift to after-hours sessions with reduced liquidity and higher spreads. Behind Nasdaq’s proposal lie strong interests. Large institutional investors want the market to react immediately to geopolitical events that occur outside U.S. trading hours  in European or Asian developments. Hardcore day traders also want the change. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  however  has its reasons to hesitate. Serious questions are raised regarding the protection of retail investors  who would find it difficult to monitor their portfolios 24 hours a day. There are also concerns about market manipulation during hours of low liquidity. There are analysts who believe that if the Nasdaq proposal is accepted  Wall Street will evolve into a Las Vegas that never closes  and the ability for analysis and clear information will be lost. The discussion  of course  also affects European stock exchanges. If the Americans open Pandora’s box  its curses will certainly reach our own land as well.When Brussels hands Europe’s companies over to the ChineseThe case of the company iRobot should be of particular concern to European governments that take pleasure in over-regulation. The bankruptcy of iRobot and the transfer of control to China’s Shenzhen PICEA Robotics today constitutes a classic example that Brussels’ over-regulation can destroy value while trying to protect it. iRobot became globally known during the pandemic when millions of consumers trapped in their homes bought Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners. The return to normality brought a collapse in sales  as Chinese competitors offered similar products at half the cost. In 2022  Amazon offered to acquire the collapsing iRobot. The European Commission  however  was concerned that Amazon would use home-mapping data from Roombas for targeted marketing. Ultimately  salvation came from the East. Shenzhen PICEA was already a main supplier of components to iRobot—it knew every detail of the technology. Now it is taking over the entire company at a particularly low price. It acquires an American brand (brand equity) and patents worth billions. Amazon  in January 2024  decided to pay the $94 million break-up fee and withdraw gracefully  rather than become involved in a time-consuming legal battle with the EU. European bureaucrats prevented the American acquisition in order to protect Europeans’ “personal data” and allowed American technology and IP to be handed over into Chinese hands.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.21,0.13,0.66,True,English,"['The farmer', 'EYDAP tariffs', 'reality show', 'K.M.', 'application', 'decisions', 'Zoe', 'Davos', 'Papachelas', 'documentary', 'ND MP Andreas Katsaniotis', 'journalist Nikos Giannopoulos', 'Near heart attacks', 'many unpleasant remarks', 'New Year Doxology', 'other official figures', 'fuel station owners', 'MEP Nikos Pappas', 'New Year wishes', 'special digital application', 'ND MPs', 'special tax', 'other hand', 'relevant application', 'violent incident', 'stunned crowd', 'first time', 'particular guy', 'classic thug', 'previous instances', 'public opinion', 'tough-guy talk', 'European authorities', 'current affairs', 'bras de', 'excise duty', 'competent ministries', 'back door', 'smuggling phenomena', 'exact quantity', 'agricultural machinery', 'corresponding quantity', 'QR codes', 'Agricultural Development', 'Minister Tsiaras', 'painstaking efforts', 'hard line', 'EYDAP tariffs', '2 to 3 euros', '3.5 million connections', '1 million connections', 'vulnerable groups', 'K.M.', 'small groups', 'agricultural issues', 'site inspections', 'most objections', 'first Belharra', 'Nikitas Kaklamanis', 'prime minister', 'private meeting', 'Holy Metropolis', 'Presidential Mansion', 'political leadership', 'agricultural diesel', 'AADE database', 'total quantity', 'Kyriakos Mitsotakis', 'first frigate', 'individualized data', 'same information', 'ELGA contributions', 'farmers’ money', 'MEP.', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'today', 'note', 'front', 'restaurant', 'Strasbourg', 'violence', 'Tsipras', 'Famelos', 'party', 'behavior', 'course', 'type', 'peinirli', 'bombs', 'everything', 'Greek', 'fer', 'smartphones', 'refund', 'EFC', 'pump', 'column', 'basis', 'case', 'tractor', 'applications', 'solutions', 'yesterday', 'government', 'number', 'officials', 'Vice-Presidency', 'Ministry', 'mistake', 'stroke', 'colleague', 'payments', 'OPEKEPE', 'end', 'trust', 'extremists', 'blockades', 'ATAK', 'fields', 'Serres', 'question', 'dialogue', 'footing', 'event', 'Increases', 'RAAEY', 'order', 'month', 'meter', 'socially', 'atmosphere', 'discussion', 'agronomists', 'Parliament', 'France', 'delivery', 'control', 'Speaker', 'show', 'frigates', 'countdown', 'Kimon', 'Greece', 'Tasoulas', 'submission', 'Athens', 'Republic', 'abo']",2025-12-18,2025-12-19,en.protothema.gr
