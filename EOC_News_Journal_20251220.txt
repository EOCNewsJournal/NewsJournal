The loan will not rely on frozen Russian assets.,"EU leaders agree on $105bn Ukraine loan  but without relying on frozen Russian assetstoggle caption Stephanie Lecocq  Reuters/Pool via APEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years  but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.After almost four years of war  the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need 137 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy  and desperately needs the money by spring.The plan had been to use some of the 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian assets that are frozen in Europe  mostly in Belgium.Sponsor MessageThe leaders worked deep into Thursday night to reassure Belgium that they would protect it from any Russian retaliation if it backed the ""reparations loan"" plan but in the end the leaders did not use that option  but as the talks bogged down the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.""We have a deal. Decision to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) of support to Ukraine for 2026-27 approved. We committed  we delivered "" EU Council President António Costa said in a post on social media.Not all countries agreed to the loan package. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic refuse to support Ukraine and opposed it  but a deal was reached in which they did not block the package and were promised protection from any financial fallout.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  who is Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europea and describes himself as a peacemaker  said ""I would not like a European Union in war.""""To give money means war."" said Orbán. He also described the rejected plan to use the frozen Russian assets as a ""dead end.""French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was a major advance  saying that borrowing on capital markets ""was the most realistic and practical way"" to fund Ukraine and its war efforts.Sponsor MessageGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the decision.""The financial package for Ukraine has been finalized "" Merz said in a statement  noting that ""Ukraine is granted a zero-interest loan.""""These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come "" Merz added. He said the frozen assets will remain blocked until Russia has paid war reparations to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that would cost over 600 billion euros ($700 billion).""If Russia does not pay reparations we will — in full accordance with international law — make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan "" Merz said.Zelenskyy  who traveled to Brussels for a summit that took place during fiery protests by farmers angry about a proposed trade deal with five South American countries  had appealed for a quick decision to keep Ukraine afloat in the new year.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned early on Thursday that it would be a case of sending ""either money today or blood tomorrow"" to help Ukraine.The plan to use frozen Russian assets got bogged down as Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever rejected the scheme as legally risky  and warned that it could harm the business of Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial clearing house where 193 billion euros ($226 billion) in frozen assets are held.Belgium was rattled last Friday when Russia's Central Bank launched a lawsuit against Euroclear to prevent any loan being provided to Ukraine using its money  which is frozen under EU sanctions slapped on Moscow after its launched its full-scale war in 2022.""For me  the reparations loan was not a good idea "" De Wever told reporters after the meeting. ""When we explained the text again  there were so many questions that I said  I told you so  I told you so. There are a lot of loose ends. And if you start pulling at the loose ends in the strings  the thing collapses.""Sponsor Message""We avoided stepping into a precedent that risks undermining legal certainty worldwide. We safeguarded the principle that Europe respects law  even when it is hard  even when we are under pressure "" he said  adding that the EU ""delivered a strong political signal. Europe stands behind Ukraine.""Still  Costa said that the EU ""reserves its right to make use of the immobilized assets to repay this loan.""",neutral,0.04,0.86,0.1,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['$105bn Ukraine loan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU leaders', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'EU Council President António Costa', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'five South American countries', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'frozen Russian assets toggle', 'strong political signal', 'Russian immobilized assets', 'International Monetary Fund', 'massive interest-free loan', 'next two years', 'European Union leaders', '$105bn Ukraine loan', 'reparations loan"" plan', 'frozen assets', 'Russian retaliation', 'financial fallout', 'EU sanctions', 'four years', 'financial package', 'EU leaders', 'Stephanie Lecocq', 'economic needs', '137 billion euros', '210 billion euros', 'Sponsor Message', 'capital markets', '90 billion euros', 'social media', 'Czech Republic', 'closest ally', 'major advance', 'practical way', 'zero-interest loan', 'budgetary needs', '600 billion euros', 'full accordance', 'international law', 'fiery protests', 'new year', '193 billion euros', 'Central Bank', 'good idea', 'many questions', 'loose ends', 'legal certainty', 'loan package', 'Thursday night', 'dead end', 'war efforts', 'war reparations', 'full-scale war', 'quick decision', 'trade deal', 'caption', 'Reuters/Pool', 'Friday', 'military', 'differences', 'Belgium', 'funds', 'government', 'Kyiv', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'money', 'spring', 'option', 'talks', 'support', 'post', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'protection', 'peacemaker', 'borrowing', 'realistic', 'statement', 'summit', 'place', 'farmers', 'case', 'blood', 'scheme', 'business', 'Euroclear', 'lawsuit', 'Moscow', 'reporters', 'meeting', 'text', 'lot', 'strings', 'thing', 'precedent', 'principle', 'pressure', 'right']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,npr.org
54415,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/europe/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-deal-hnk-intl,Ukraine loan: Europe salvages credibility with $105 billion deal  reserves right to use Russian assets to fund it,Europe’s 90-billion-euro interest-free loan to keep Ukraine’s economy and military from a budgetary blackhole through 2027 didn’t come about in the way some ...,Brussels  Belgium —European Union leaders reached a deal early Friday on a $105 billion loan to keep Ukraine’s economy and military from a budgetary blackhole through 2027. While it didn’t come about in the way some of them wanted  the fact it came about at all has been hailed by top officials as a win for the bloc.“Had we left Brussels divided today  Europe would have walked away from geopolitical relevance ” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters a little before 4 a.m. “It would have been a total disaster.”Some of the leaders had hoped to agree on a controversial proposal to use billions in frozen Russian funds to fund Ukraine  but that plan was shelved due to opposition from Belgium and other countries. Instead  EU leaders opted to borrow the money from investors for a loan to Ukraine while reserving the right to use the Russian assets in the future. Under the deal  Kyiv will not have to pay back the money until Russia pays reparations at the end of the conflict.The funds unlocked by the loan will be welcomed in Kyiv as it battles to hold off Russian battlefield gains while negotiating with Washington over a plan to end the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had warned that a failure to provide finding for Ukraine would mean the country would not have enough money “for life and weapons.”He hailed the 11th-hour breakthrough Friday.“This is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience ” Zelensky wrote on X. “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilized and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years. Thank you for the result and for unity.”European leaders also took aim at Moscow.“The message we are sending to Russia today is crystal-clear ” European Council President Antonio Costa said. “First  you have not achieved your objectives in Ukraine. Second  Europe stands with Ukraine  today  tomorrow and as long as necessary.”Due in part to the United States cutting funding  Ukraine would have had a funding gap of $160 billion (€137 billion) over the next two years  according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund. The EU was looking to meet two-thirds of that  or about $105 billion (€90 billion).A Ukrainian serviceman checks ammunition for a self-propelled howitzer in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine on December 3  2025. Sofiia Gatilova/ReutersThe idea of using the frozen assets of Russia’s central bank wasn’t a new one. It was floated from the early days of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.And it’s long seen fierce opposition from some European powers. France’s President Emmanuel Macron said in the Oval Office in February that touching the Russian funds would be a breach of international law.But earlier this week  he expressed support for using the funds.As with so much regarding Western support for Ukraine  yet another red line has fallen.Tough talkIt wasn’t all plain sailing. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic all agreed to the loan based on EU borrowing but on condition it would not impact them financially.As for the reparations loan  Belgium – which holds a large majority of the immobilized funds – is fearful of future retaliation by Russia or liability if a peace agreement leads to Moscow demanding return of the funds.Ahead of the summit  Belgium’s De Wever demanded “binding guarantees” from all EU member states in return for his nation’s approval of the reparations loan.“Mere oral promises are not enough ” he said at the Belgian parliament Thursday.Until now  the EU has been using the interest from the Russian assets  which are mostly bonds  to finance some of its support for Kyiv. But as the bonds themselves mature  they are turned into cash  and this is the cash the EU’s executive wanted to borrow and lend to Ukraine until Russia pays reparations.On Monday  the Russian central bank filed a lawsuit seeking billions in damages from Belgium’s Euroclear depository. The bank called the move a preemptive measure against the EU plan to transfer the frozen assets held by Euroclear “to third parties ” according to Russian state news agency TASS.And on Thursday  the Russian central bank said it would claim damages from European banks in the amount of the frozen assets they hold and lost profits.Side-effectsAs the longest night of the year loomed in Brussels  the outlook looked dark for Europe.US President Donald Trump lashed out at European leaders as “weak” in a recent interview  days after his administration’s new National Security Strategy accused Europe of being “trapped in political crisis” and suffering from a “lack of self-confidence.”A US-backed  28-point peace plan that was leaked last month called for investing $100 billion of the Russian central bank assets frozen around the world “in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine ” and for the US to receive profits from those investments. The assets frozen in Europe account for most of Moscow’s immobilized assets globally.Russia's President Vladimir Putin  accompanied by Kremlin economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov  meets with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in Moscow on December 2  2025. Alexander Kazakova/AFP/Getty ImagesThat set off a flurry of diplomatic efforts among European leaders  outraged at the thought of the White House commandeering assets in their custody.In a thinly veiled swipe at the United States  President of the EU executive arm Ursula von der Leyen called this week’s summit “Europe’s independence moment ” hammering the idea 10 times in her short speech before the European Parliament Wednesday.The summit  she said  was about facing “the reality of the world that has become dangerous and transactional. A world of wars  a world of predators.”“Europe must be responsible for its own security. This is no longer an option  it is a must ” she said.The transatlantic trust long taken for granted has indeed evaporated this year.Europe is now wary of forces stoking division on two fronts: from the cultural attacks of a transactional White House and from the subversion and antagonism of Moscow. Before the EU summit began  the near-constant efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine Europe hit new levels Thursday when he referred to the continent’s leaders as “piglets” in an address to Russia’s military officials.“The Russians work day and night to fragment Europe  and they are better at doing that than Europe is at remaining cohesive ” Tom Keatinge  director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank  told CNN.LifeboatThe White House has publicly latched on to Ukraine’s past battlefield difficulties or structural weaknesses as leverage to strike a hasty peace deal.Talking before the European negotiations concluded  Zelensky said that a funding deal would allay that threat.“We are more confident at the negotiating table if we have these assets ” he said  as Kyiv’s ability to resist Moscow’s aggression would be publicly secured for at least another couple of years.He also said that a failure to agree on funding for Ukraine would have badly wounded Kyiv’s all-important drone industry  a lifeline for frontline troops.Similarly  the country’s vaunted long-range attacks on Russia  including against Moscow’s oil and natural gas infrastructure  would be affected  he said.“All of that will disappear ” he told journalists.The early hours of Friday morning brought some relief then for Kyiv and for Brussels.Facing Russia’s pitiless attacks in Ukraine and a White House seemingly hungry for quick  rather than just  peace  Europe’s lifeboat for Ukraine – one clawed back from the jaws of division and delay – promises an emboldened friend to Kyiv in the uncertain months ahead.,neutral,0.37,0.62,0.0,mixed,0.07,0.21,0.71,True,English,"['Ukraine loan', '$105 billion deal', 'Russian assets', 'Europe', 'credibility', 'right', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'Russian state news agency', 'new National Security Strategy', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'US-backed, 28-point peace plan', 'Russian central bank assets', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'financial security guarantee', 'Russian battlefield gains', 'next two years', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Kremlin economic envoy', 'European Union leaders', 'EU member states', 'Belgian parliament', 'Ukrainian serviceman', 'new one', 'peace agreement', 'European leaders', 'European powers', 'European banks', 'Russian assets', 'coming years', 'United States', 'international law', 'Russian funds', 'budgetary blackhole', 'top officials', 'geopolitical relevance', 'total disaster', 'controversial proposal', 'other countries', '11th-hour breakthrough', 'propelled howitzer', 'Kharkiv region', 'Sofiia Gatilova/Reuters', 'early days', 'Oval Office', 'red line', 'Tough talk', 'plain sailing', 'Czech Republic', 'large majority', 'binding guarantees', 'oral promises', 'third parties', 'longest night', 'recent interview', 'political crisis', 'US-led efforts', 'Kirill Dmitriev', 'frozen assets', 'EU leaders', 'EU borrowing', 'EU plan', '$105 billion loan', 'significant support', 'funding gap', 'fierce opposition', 'Western support', 'future retaliation', 'Euroclear depository', 'enough money', 'reparations loan', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'deal', 'Ukraine', 'economy', 'military', 'way', 'fact', 'bloc', 'reporters', '4 a', 'billions', 'investors', 'right', 'Kyiv', 'end', 'conflict', 'Washington', 'war', 'failure', 'finding', 'country', 'life', 'weapons', 'resilience', 'result', 'unity', 'aim', 'Moscow', 'message', 'objectives', 'forecasts', 'two-thirds', 'ammunition', 'December', 'idea', '2022 invasion', 'France', 'February', 'breach', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'condition', 'liability', 'return', 'summit', 'approval', 'Mere', 'interest', 'bonds', 'cash', 'executive', 'Monday', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'move', 'TASS', 'Thursday', 'amount', 'profits', 'Side-effects', 'outlook', 'administration', 'self-confidence', 'world', 'investments']",2025-12-18,2025-12-20,cnn.com
54416,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/19/which-countries-besides-russia-have-assets-frozen-by-the-eu,Which countries  besides Russia  have assets frozen by the EU?,The European Union has imposed asset freezes totalling hundreds of billions of dollars on at least 31 countries.,The European Union has imposed asset freezes totalling hundreds of billions of dollars on at least 31 countries.European Union leaders agreed not to use frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s defence in the ongoing war with Russia early on Friday.Instead  90 billion euros ($106bn) will come from an interest-free loan provided by 23 out of the 27 EU member states. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic were granted an exemption in order to allow the deal to pass following months of debate and knife-edge discussions on Thursday night.It is estimated that Ukraine will require an extra 136bn euros ($159bn) over the next two years  if it is to avoid bankruptcy as soon as April  leading the European Commission to put forth a plan to tap into some of the frozen Russian central bank assets held by the bloc.But Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever had refused to sign off on this without “ironclad guarantees” that Belgium  where most of the Russian assets are held  would be protected from potential Russian legal retaliation.Belgium estimated it could be left owing billions of euros if Moscow successfully sued Euroclear – a Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) provider in the Eurozone – where the funds are held.Hungary and Slovakia had also expressed strong opposition to the plan  with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban labelling the plan a “dead end”.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that using frozen assets to finance Ukraine would be akin to theft.How would the plan to use Russian assets have worked?Under the plan  the EU would have borrowed from Euroclear – the Belgian-based clearing house holding more than 40 trillion euros ($47 trillion) of assets – to provide Ukraine with an initial 90-billion-euro ($106bn) loan. This equates to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s funding requirements until 2027.AdvertisementThe loan would only have needed to be repaid to the EU if Russia agreed to pay reparations for the war to Ukraine. Losses from the war are estimated at about $524bn in reconstruction costs  according to the European Parliament.Which countries hold frozen Russian assets?More than 289.5 billion euros ($339.3bn) in Russian assets have been frozen by Western countries since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine  with the EU holding 209 billion euros ($247bn) of this. Belgium holds the largest share at 180 billion euros ($210bn).Belgium holds 180 billion euros ($210bn)holds 180 billion euros ($210bn) Japan holds 28 billion euros ($32.8bn)holds 28 billion euros ($32.8bn) The UK holds 27 billion euros ($31.6bn)holds 27 billion euros ($31.6bn) France holds 19 billion euros ($22.3bn)holds 19 billion euros ($22.3bn) Canada holds 15.1 billion euros ($17.7bn)holds 15.1 billion euros ($17.7bn) Luxembourg holds 10 billion euros ($11.7bn)holds 10 billion euros ($11.7bn) Switzerland holds 6.2 billion euros ($7.3bn)holds 6.2 billion euros ($7.3bn) The United States holds 4.3 billion euros ($5bn)Which EU members opposed the plan to use Russian assets?Besides Belgium  a number of EU members opposed the plan  with Belgium raising concerns that using the frozen assets without strong EU guarantees is “fundamentally wrong”.It warned that Moscow could retaliate by targeting Belgian property in Russia  while Russia-friendly countries could also lodge legal claims against Euroclear.Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban described the proposal as “stupid”  saying that tapping into Russian assets risked further escalating the conflict in Ukraine.He told reporters: “There are two countries which are at war – it’s not European Union  [it’s] Russia and Ukraine – and the European Union would like to take away the money of one of the warring party and then to give it to another one.“It’s marching into the war. The Belgian prime minister is right  we should not do that ” he said.Which countries have assets frozen by Europe?While Russia is the most prominent non-European country with significant assets frozen in Europe  several other nations outside Europe are also subject to asset freezes under the EU sanctions regimes.While Russia’s situation is unique because the EU has frozen its Sovereign Central Bank reserves  most other countries on this list primarily have assets belonging to government officials  oligarchs or specific state-owned companies frozen  rather than their entire national reserves.According to the European Commission’s sanction tracker  the EU has imposed asset freezes and a prohibition on making funds available in at least 31 countries. Many of the moves are mandated by the United Nations  and then implemented by the EU  while other asset freezes come directly as a result of EU decisions  including those on Venezuela.AdvertisementExplore the table below to find out which other countries have had assets frozen by the EU.In 2017  the EU froze assets of Venezuelan entities and individuals in response to the breakdown of democratic rule and human rights abuses in the country under President Nicolas Maduro. It specifically targeted individuals committing serious violations  and the European Council only recently extended these measures until January 2027.In 2013  the European Council decided to place Syria under restrictive measures  including asset freezes and financial restrictions. These include member states being prohibited from entering into new commitments for grants  financial assistance or concessional loans to the Government of Syria.These measures were put in place in protest against human rights violations committed under Bashar al-Assad’s regime  which was finally toppled in December last year. In 2014  the measures were expanded to include any individuals or entities which supported the regime and chemical weapons production.After the overthrow of the government in December 2024  the EU suspended some of these measures to help support the political transition in Syria  but has maintained freezes on the Assad regime and the drugs trade.Which countries have the UK and US imposed asset freezes on?According to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)  which tracks financial sanctions  the United Kingdom has frozen the UK-based assets of individuals and entities from 22 countries  with most being the same states sanctioned by the EU.The United States typically freezes assets via the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  which catalogues different levels of sanctions  the US has almost fully frozen the assets of the governments of four countries  including Cuba  Iran  North Korea and Russia. In June this year  US President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order removing US sanctions on Syria.The US has also placed country-specific sanctions on dozens of other nations.,neutral,0.0,0.96,0.04,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['countries', 'Russia', 'assets', 'EU', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'Sovereign Central Bank reserves', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'initial 90-billion-euro ($106bn) loan', 'potential Russian legal retaliation', 'entire national reserves', 'President Nicolas Maduro', 'Financial Market Infrastructure', 'Belgian-based clearing house', 'specific state-owned companies', 'human rights abuses', 'next two years', 'several other nations', 'The United States', 'frozen Russian assets', 'extra 136bn euros', 'prominent non-European country', 'European Union leaders', '27 EU member states', 'EU sanctions regimes', 'The European Union', 'most other countries', 'other asset freezes', 'strong EU guarantees', 'Belgian property', 'frozen assets', 'legal claims', 'United Nations', 'The UK', 'ironclad guarantees', 'strong opposition', 'interest-free loan', 'European Commission', 'European Parliament', 'two countries', 'Czech Republic', 'knife-edge discussions', 'Thursday night', 'FMI) provider', 'dead end', '40 trillion euros', 'funding requirements', 'reconstruction costs', 'largest share', 'warring party', 'government officials', 'sanction tracker', 'Venezuelan entities', 'democratic rule', 'serious violations', 'significant assets', 'Western countries', 'Russia-friendly countries', 'EU members', 'EU decisions', '90 billion euros', '289.5 billion euros', '209 billion euros', '15.1 billion euros', 'ongoing war', '31 countries', '180 billion', '28 billion', '27 billion', '19 billion', '10 billion', '6.2 billion', '4.3 billion', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Ukraine', 'defence', 'Friday', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'exemption', 'order', 'deal', 'months', 'debate', 'bankruptcy', 'April', 'plan', 'bloc', 'Belgium', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'Eurozone', 'funds', 'theft', 'two-thirds', 'Advertisement', 'reparations', 'Losses', 'Which', 'More', '2022 invasion', 'Japan', 'France', 'Canada', 'Luxembourg', 'Switzerland', 'number', 'concerns', 'proposal', 'conflict', 'reporters', 'money', 'situation', 'list', 'oligarchs', 'prohibition', 'moves', 'result', 'table', 'individuals', 'response', 'breakdown']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,aljazeera.com

Russia  which has condemned the freeze as “theft ” said last week it is suing Euroclear for damages caused by its “inability to manage” the assets.As EU leaders were attempting to back the ‘reparations loan’ plan on Thursday  the Bank of Russia announced in a statement: “In view of the ongoing attempts by EU authorities to illegally seize and use the Bank of Russia’s assets… [it] will claim damages from European banks in a Russian arbitration court for the illegal blocking and use of its assets.”The move is aimed at “protecting its interests ” the regulator said  noting that the claim will cover all illegally withheld assets and lost profit.The EU earlier dismissed Moscow’s lawsuit against Euroclear as “speculative ” but some legal experts and officials warn it could damage the bloc’s financial institutions if it spreads beyond Russia  triggering lengthy cross-border litigation  reputational harm  and risks to the EU’s investment climate.Shortly after the case was filed  Fitch Ratings put the depository on watch for a possible downgrade  citing legal and liquidity risks. Kirill Dmitriev  the Russian presidential adviser on international investment  said a downgrade could drive investors to move funds elsewhere.The first hearing in the Euroclear case at the Moscow Arbitration Court is set for January 16.

Apparently there is "" Dmitriev said.Earlier in the day  EU Council President Antonio Costa stated that the EU would provide Ukraine with a 90 billion euro ($105 billion) loan  based on the EU budget and potentially repayable using frozen Russian assets.Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the EU and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros. Around 200 billion euros are held in European accounts  predominantly in the Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear. The EU Commission has been seeking approval from EU member states to use frozen Russian assets to finance Kiev's war efforts.The Kremlin has said that any attempts to confiscate Russian assets would be theft and a violation of international law.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251219/belgian-prime-minister-calls-refusal-to-confiscate-russian-assets-victory-for-intl-law-1123324245.htmlunited kingdom (uk)ukrainerussiaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalrussian direct investment fund  russian assets  kirill dmitriev  the head of the russian direct investment fund (rdif)  economic cooperation with foreign countries",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Russian Special Envoy', 'Russian Assets', 'Common Sense', 'Law', 'EU', 'Decision', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer', 'EU Council President Antonio Costa', 'Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian Direct Investment Fund', 'Russian special presidential envoy', 'friedrich merz united kingdom', 'Russian Special Envoy', 'The EU Commission', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Russian foreign reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU member states', 'ukraine european union', 'European accounts', 'foreign countries', 'The Kremlin', 'EU budget', 'Sputnik International', 'economic cooperation', 'illegal scheme', 'major win', 'other ""warmongers', 'fatal blow', 'military operation', 'G7 nations', 'Rossiya Segodnya', '90 billion euro', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'Kirill Dmitriev', 'Common Sense', 'entire world', 'war efforts', '105 billion) loan', 'international law', 'ukraine russia', 'sputnikglobe', 'decision', 'russian-assets', 'head', 'RDIF', 'Friday', 'cdn1.', '15f9358979eeab5ceeacee4fc9752ed', 'voices', 'reason', 'attempts', 'theft', 'violation', 'others', 'alternative', 'start', 'half', 'approval', 'Kiev', 'belgian-prime-minister', 'intl', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,sputnikglobe.com

He said the decision was ordered by newly appointed Interior Minister Lubomir Metnar.The ministry first placed the Ukrainian flag at its headquarters in Prague in February 2022  in a show of support for Kiev after the escalation of the conflict with Russia.Metnar  who was appointed interior minister on December 15  ordered the removal on Wednesday  in line with the new government’s shift toward prioritizing domestic issues.“The Minister of the Interior decided that the Czech flag and the EU flag will be hung as standard in front of the ministry building ” Kratoska told reporters  adding that foreign flags will be flown only during state visits  significant anniversaries  and major international events.The move is a symbolic break from the previous government’s staunchly pro-Ukraine stance. In a similar gesture last month  newly elected Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Tomio Okamura ordered the Ukrainian flag removed from the lower house headquarters.Parties in the new Czech ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis said throughout the election campaign that they would prioritize domestic issues. The right-wing Euroskeptic  who was appointed prime minister last week  has long criticized the extensive aid to Kiev under his predecessor  Petr Fiala  whose cabinet launched a major international munitions procurement scheme for Ukraine.Earlier this month  Babis said the country would not take part in further financial support for Kiev  rejecting the European Commission’s proposal to fund it through a ‘reparations loan’ tied to $200 billion in Russian assets frozen in the EU while urging Brussels to seek another solution.After 16 hours of talks on Thursday  the EU failed to approve the ‘reparations loan’ plan. Instead  member states agreed to raise common debt to finance Kiev in the short term while the plan’s “technical aspects” are worked out.Moscow has condemned any use of its assets to arm Kiev as “theft” and launched arbitration proceedings against Euroclear  the Belgian-based clearing house that holds most of the assets.

54421,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629686-eu-russian-assets-steal-fails/,EU’s plan to steal Russian assets for Ukraine fails,The EU has rejected a proposal to steal Russia’s sovereign wealth held in teh bloc in order to finance Ukraine’s imploding economy Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc has reached a compromise on a €90 billion lifeline for Kiev  pushing the ‘reparations loan’ scheme further down the roadThe EU’s plan to steal Russian assets held in the bloc in order to fund Ukraine’s military and prolong its disastrous war has failed to get the backing of bloc leaders. The other key EU summit pillar – approving a contentious trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur – was also aborted at the last minute amid chaotic protests by several-thousand farmers in the Belgian capital.Following some 16 hours of talks  during which the deep divisions within the bloc were exacerbated by legislative overreach pushed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  European Council discussions ended without agreement on the controversial proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a €90 billion ($105 billion) loan aimed at allowing Kiev to continue its military campaign.Instead  member states agreed to raise common debt – borrowing on the capital markets – to finance Kiev in the short term while “technical aspects of the reparations loan are worked out ” according to European Council President Antonio Costa.“We have a deal ” Costa wrote on X around 3am  without addressing the funding mechanism behind the package. Merz similarly glossed over the bloc’s failure to back the loan with frozen Russian assets  insisting that “Ukraine will receive an interest-free loan of €90 billion  as I suggested.”Moscow has already initiated arbitration proceedings against Euroclear  the Belgian-based clearing house that holds some €180 billion of Russian funds  and during the talks in Brussels announced that it had widened the case to include “European banks ” increasing the risk to European lenders of backing the plan.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever was at the center of the disagreement  though his opposition to the plan to steal Russian assets was supported by Italy’s Giorgia Meloni  Hungary’s Viktor Orban  Slovakia’s Robert Fico  and the Czech Republic’s Andrej Babis. The latter three reportedly tabled an option for EU members to provide joint debt for Ukraine instead – exempting their countries from the idea but also pledging not to veto it.Merz and von der Leyen are thought to have rejected that plan  and instead insisted on more a dangerous option to steal Russia’s assets and attempt to give Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky enough money to keep fighting for two more years. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk put it ahead of the meeting  “either money today or blood tomorrow.”Without the EU war chest  Zelensky faces a short-term economic crisis. Ukraine needs some €72 billion to repay a G7 loan and stay afloat fiscally.Following the EU Council’s failure to endorse the Merz/von der Leyen war option  the bloc has effectively denied itself the “seat at the table” hosting Ukraine peace talks that it was demanding since the US took the diplomatic initiative.Attention will now turn to a meeting between US and Russian delegations in Miami  and to US President Donald Trump’s call for peace by Christmas.,negative,0.0,0.36,0.64,negative,0.0,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'plan', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'other key EU summit pillar', 'Merz/von der Leyen war option', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'US President Donald Trump', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'European Council discussions', 'Belgian-based clearing house', 'short-term economic crisis', 'EU war chest', 'contentious trade deal', 'frozen Russian assets', 'South American bloc', 'reparations loan’ scheme', 'Belgian capital', 'EU Council', 'disastrous war', 'European banks', 'European lenders', 'Ukraine peace talks', 'dangerous option', 'EU members', 'Russian funds', 'Russian delegations', 'last minute', 'chaotic protests', 'several-thousand farmers', 'deep divisions', 'legislative overreach', 'controversial proposal', 'member states', 'common debt', 'capital markets', 'short term', 'technical aspects', 'funding mechanism', 'arbitration proceedings', 'Giorgia Meloni', 'Viktor Orban', 'Robert Fico', 'Czech Republic', 'Andrej Babis', 'joint debt', 'diplomatic initiative', 'interest-free loan', 'G7 loan', 'military campaign', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'enough money', 'bloc leaders', '€90 billion lifeline', '€90 billion ($', 'compromise', 'Kiev', 'road', 'plan', 'order', 'backing', 'Mercosur', '16 hours', 'compatriot', 'agreement', '3am', 'package', 'failure', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'case', 'risk', 'center', 'opposition', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'latter', 'countries', 'idea', 'two', 'years', 'meeting', 'blood', 'seat', 'table', 'Attention', 'Miami', 'call', 'Christmas']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,rt.com

(AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)By LORNE COOK  SAM McNEIL and ANGELA CHARLTONEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years  but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.After almost four years of war  the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need 137 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy  and desperately needs the money by spring.The plan had been to use some of the 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian assets that are frozen in Europe  mostly in Belgium.The leaders worked deep into Thursday night to reassure Belgium that they would protect it from any Russian retaliation if it backed the “reparations loan” plan but in the end the leaders did not use that option  but as the talks bogged down the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.“We have a deal. Decision to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) of support to Ukraine for 2026-27 approved. We committed  we delivered ” EU Council President António Costa said in a post on social media.Not all countries agreed to the loan package. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic refuse to support Ukraine and opposed it  but a deal was reached in which they did not block the package and were promised protection from any financial fallout.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  who is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europea and describes himself as a peacemaker  said “I would not like a European Union in war.”“To give money means war.” said Orbán. He also described the rejected plan to use the frozen Russian assets as a “dead end.”French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was a major advance  saying that borrowing on capital markets “was the most realistic and practical way” to fund Ukraine and its war efforts.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the decision.“The financial package for Ukraine has been finalized ” Merz said in a statement  noting that “Ukraine is granted a zero-interest loan.""“These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come ” Merz added. He said the frozen assets will remain blocked until Russia has paid war reparations to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that would cost over 600 billion euros ($700 billion).“If Russia does not pay reparations we will — in full accordance with international law — make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan ” Merz said.Zelenskyy  who traveled to Brussels for a summit that took place during fiery protests by farmers angry about a proposed trade deal with five South American countries  had appealed for a quick decision to keep Ukraine afloat in the new year.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned early on Thursday that it would be a case of sending “either money today or blood tomorrow” to help Ukraine.The plan to use frozen Russian assets got bogged down as Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever rejected the scheme as legally risky  and warned that it could harm the business of Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial clearing house where 193 billion euros ($226 billion) in frozen assets are held.Belgium was rattled last Friday when Russia’s Central Bank launched a lawsuit against Euroclear to prevent any loan being provided to Ukraine using its money  which is frozen under EU sanctions slapped on Moscow after its launched its full-scale war in 2022.“For me  the reparations loan was not a good idea "" De Wever told reporters after the meeting. “When we explained the text again  there were so many questions that I said  I told you so  I told you so. There are a lot of loose ends. And if you start pulling at the loose ends in the strings  the thing collapses.”“We avoided stepping into a precedent that risks undermining legal certainty worldwide. We safeguarded the principle that Europe respects law  even when it is hard  even when we are under pressure ” he said  adding that the EU ""delivered a strong political signal. Europe stands behind Ukraine.""Still  Costa said that the EU ""reserves its right to make use of the immobilized assets to repay this loan.”© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sign upBut the bloc “blinked” when it came to the sterner step of using seized Russian assets to do so. Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz “forcefully advocated” for the “reparations loan”  which he had framed as “the only option”  said Euronews.But it was Belgian PM Bart De Wever who clearly came out on top. With the majority of the frozen Russian funds held by Belgium-based financial services firm Euroclear  De Wever “played hardball”  refusing to accept a deal that could “leave his country exposed to Russian retaliation”. His demands for unlimited protection from any legal complications arising from the use of the assets made the proposal “unpalatable for the rest” of the EU countries.The joint debt arrangement means there is no guarantee that the funds will ever be paid back. The loan would be “interest-free” and Kyiv would pay it back with “reparations cash from Moscow”. However  it is “by no means guaranteed Russia will ever pay reparations for its invasion and the loan is likely going to become a grant”.“Arguably  it didn’t need to be so messy ” said Politico. Ukraine’s European allies “have the resources to beat Putin if they really want to”. The EU’s financial position as an “economic superpower” is already strong compared to Russia  with the bloc’s combined GDP standing at €18 trillion against Russia’s €2 trillion.Sign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsWhat’s concerning “for Ukraine’s allies” is the dwindling support among the public in Europe’s biggest economies for Ukraine and its war effort. French and German respondents to a Politico poll “were even more reluctant to keep financing Ukraine than people in the United States”. By deciding on the €90 billion loan deal  “Europe’s leaders opted for the easiest answer this week. And even that was almost too hard.”What next?The defeat of the Merz plan in favour of the joint debt funding arrangement was undoubtedly a “fumble”  but from Ukraine’s perspective “there is little difference in the outcome”  said the Financial Times. The loan and the likelihood of it never being paid back relieves any further pressure on Ukraine’s “already aggravated finances”.As for the Russian assets  EU leaders emphasised that the frozen funds “will remain immobilised and the union reserves its right to make use of them to repay the loan”.

For a country warning of severe budgetary shortfalls — brought on by the ongoing war — as early as next spring  the agreement provides a crucial lifeline.""We committed  we delivered "" European Council President Antonio Costa said after the summit  visibly relieved to be able to present results in the early hours of Friday morning.At the same time  the summit highlighted the growing difficulty for the European Union to translate political ambition into common action  particularly when legal risks  diverging national interests and geopolitical pressure collide.Ukraine to receive EU's €90 billion loan despite setbacks To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoJoint borrowing instead of frozen assetsInstead of using Russia's frozen assets  the final agreement relies on joint EU borrowing. The money will be raised on financial markets  backed by the EU budget  and passed on to Ukraine as an interest-free loan. Kyiv would only be required to repay it once Russia pays war reparations. It remains far from clear  however  whether Russia would ever agree to pay reparations.Relying on joint borrowing was not the preferred option of the European Commission and several major capitals such as Berlin  which had pushed for using Russia's frozen central bank assets for months. These assets are held mostly at the Belgium-based financial services firm Euroclear. The idea was to fund Ukraine while avoiding new burdens on EU taxpayers and increasing pressure on Moscow.That plan failed primarily because of concerns raised by Belgium. As the host country of Euroclear  Brussels argued that it faced disproportionate legal and financial risks if Russia retaliated or pursued litigation. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever demanded far-reaching guarantees from other EU states  demands that France  Italy and others were unwilling to meet.Reports: US aims to block frozen assets plan for Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoWhat does that mean for Europe's ability to act?The division  as well as the current agreement  reveal a more fundamental question: If the legal and political obstacles to using Russian assets are too great now  under what circumstances might they ever become manageable later?In an interview with DW  Jana Kobzova  co-director of the European Security Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR)  was equally critical. ""We had an option of using our leverage vis-à-vis the Russians  and vis-à-vis the US  and we didn't go for that "" she said. This  Kobzova argued  put Europe's ability to act as an independent and influential global player into question.Tinatin Akhvlediani  a researcher at the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS)  agreed that the result is not the optimal solution  but argued that it preserved the EU's credibility as a political actor  able to reach decisions and finance Ukraine  even when under pressure. ""Ukraine will get the money  and that was the most important thing "" she said.Members of the European Parliament were more critical. Iratxe García Pérez  first vice-president of the Socialists and Democrats group  said the agreement ""falls short"" because it doesn't establish a sustainable funding model and leaves the financial burden with the EU rather than shifting it to Russia. She argues that while the €90-billion loan ""is necessary  it cannot be the final solution.""European Council President Antonio Costa was happy to present the results Image: Stephanie Lecocq/REUTERSUnity  but with objectionsThe summit outcome allowed all sides to claim partial success. Ukraine receives funding  supporters of legal caution avoided a precedent-setting use of frozen assets  and others ensured that the assets in question remain immobilized and could still  in theory  be used in the future to repay the loan if Russia refuses to pay reparations.But questions about unity remain. Three member states — Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic — secured exemptions from the financial guarantees linked to the loan. While they will not block the package  they will not carry direct liability for it  either.These opt-outs underline what many analysts see as a trend towards a more fragmented form of EU solidarity. Rather than all 27 countries taking decisions together and sharing risks equally  coalitions are increasingly formed on a case-by-case basis.Akhvlediani pointed out that the EU was searching for agility in a fast-changing world. She argued that a deal — even an imperfect one — was preferable to paralysis. ""We may not have full unity across all 27 member states  but we have unity across the majority of them  and that at least allows the European Union to act "" she explained.Unanimity appears to be at stake in the EU  as the agreement exposes divided preferences over how to finance Ukraine in its ongoing war efforts Image: Stephanie Lecocq/REUTERSEU's role in the world put into questionThe decision comes at a time when European leaders are keen to assert influence over any future peace talks on Ukraine  particularly as the United States sends mixed signals about its long-term engagement.Both experts agree that continued financial support strengthens Europe's claim to relevance in the peace process. However  the failure to mobilize Russia's frozen assets weakens the EU's leverage and hinders its ability to move from a simple ""payer"" to an actual ""player "" as Akhvlediani put it.This has strategic consequences  Kobzova from the ECFR added  because Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue to view European leaders as secondary actors. ""He is willing to talk business with them  but not security. On that  he is very keen on keeping them out  and the Americans in "" she told DW.Beyond Ukraine: EU leadership under strainThe Ukraine funding debate was not the only issue that proved divisive at the summit. Plans to finalize the long-negotiated Mercosur trade agreement with South American countries were again delayed after objections from France and Italy.Farmers disrupt EU talks on 'flagship' Mercosur trade deal To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoThe postponement prompted criticism from former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström  who said the EU had ""missed an opportunity to show strength and unity "" stressing that the agreement ""is not only about trade but also geopolitics.""Under the Ukraine deal  the European Commission is now expected to move quickly to issue EU-backed bonds on financial markets  using the EU budget as a guarantee. Once approved by member states  the funds could begin flowing to Kyiv in early 2026  providing predictable financing over the next two years.For now  the immediate crisis has been contained. Ukraine has funding  and the EU avoided an outright failure to agree. But the summit also left a lingering question: whether Europe can match its strategic ambitions with the unity and tools needed to act decisively in a rapidly hardening geopolitical landscape.Edited by: Maren Sass",neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.26,0.58,True,English,"['Ukraine funding', 'EU', 'limits', 'unity', 'DW', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Iratxe García Pérez', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'Belgium-based financial services firm', 'severe budgetary shortfalls', 'several major capitals', 'European Security Programme', 'influential global player', 'European Policy Studies', 'Three member states', 'next two years', 'central bank assets', 'sustainable funding model', 'other EU states', 'joint EU borrowing', 'frozen assets plan', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'European Parliament', 'Joint borrowing', 'next spring', 'financial markets', 'financial guarantees', 'financial risks', 'late-night compromise', 'decisive test', 'financing needs', 'country warning', 'ongoing war', 'crucial lifeline', 'same time', 'growing difficulty', 'political ambition', 'common action', 'national interests', 'web browser', 'new burdens', 'host country', 'reaching guarantees', 'political obstacles', 'Foreign Relations', 'based Centre', 'optimal solution', 'political actor', 'important thing', 'first vice-president', 'Democrats group', 'final solution', 'Stephanie Lecocq', 'partial success', 'precedent-setting use', 'Czech Republic', 'direct liability', 'many analysts', 'fragmented form', 'case basis', 'changing world', 'imperfect one', 'financial burden', 'EU finances', 'EU leaders', 'EU taxpayers', 'disproportionate legal', 'legal caution', 'EU solidarity', 'early hours', 'Friday morning', 'HTML5 video', 'final agreement', 'interest-free loan', 'preferred option', 'current agreement', 'Russian assets', 'Jana Kobzova', 'Tinatin Akhvlediani', '€90-billion loan', 'legal risks', 'geopolitical pressure', 'war reparations', 'fundamental question', 'summit outcome', 'EU budget', '€90 billion loan', '16 hours', 'Ukraine', 'negotiations', 'Brussels', 'deal', 'Kyiv', 'results', 'setbacks', 'JavaScript', 'money', 'Berlin', 'months', 'Euroclear', 'idea', 'Moscow', 'concerns', 'litigation', 'France', 'Italy', 'others', 'Reports', 'division', 'circumstances', 'interview', 'DW', 'director', 'ECFR', 'leverage', 'Russians', 'independent', 'researcher', 'CEPS', 'credibility', 'decisions', 'Members', 'Socialists', 'Image', 'REUTERS', 'Unity', 'objections', 'sides', 'supporters', 'theory', 'future', 'questions', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'exemptions', 'package', 'opt-outs', 'trend', '27 countries', 'coalitions', 'agility', '2026']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,dw.com

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.The 27-nation bloc's heads of state had planned to use some of the 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian assets that are frozen in Europe  mostly in Belgium. But despite working through the night into Friday morning  they failed to convince Belgium that the country would be protected from any Russian retaliation if it backed the “reparations loan” plan.They settled on an alternative: borrowing $106 billion on capital markets.After almost four years of war  the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need 137 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy  and desperately needs the money by spring to pay for everything from ammunition to infrastructure repairs.Here's what to know about the loan.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had brought to Thursday's summit two proposals to keep Ukraine afloat.The first plan had been to use some of the 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian assets that are frozen in Europe  mostly in Belgium. The money has been frozen under EU sanctions slapped on Moscow after its launched its full-scale war in 2022.Leaders like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron backed this first option  especially since that method of funding would require support from two-thirds of the 27 EU nations.That majority was expected to be far easier politically to reach than the total unanimity required by the EU foundational treaty for the second option: borrowing money from capital markets.But throughout the long night  Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart de Wever refused to budge on the reparations loan. It was Hungary  whose leader Viktor Orbán has long objected to Brussels’ embrace of Ukraine  that compromised.The European Council said it would use Article 20 of the Treaty of Europe to allow the EU to shoulder debt for a zero-interest loan to Ukraine.It’s a simpler and possibly safer solution compared to the reparations loans. It is also akin to how the EU took on 750 billion euro in debt in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic for a gigantic economic recovery fund. Large borrowing has become a hallmark of the administration of von der Leyen.Not all countries agreed to the loan package. Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic refused to take on debt for Ukraine  but a deal was reached in which they did not block the loan package and were promised protection from any financial fallout.Orbán  who is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe  claimed double victory at the summit in a post on X.“We did not allow Europe to issue a declaration of war on Russia by using Russian assets” and “we succeeded in protecting Hungarian families” from additional debt  he said. He estimated the cost to Hungarians would have been 1000 billion HUF or $3 billion.Orbán praised the cooperation of Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic  which were all excluded from financial burdens from the loan to allow for the unanimity required by the EU treaty.But Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš distanced himself Friday from Slovakia and Hungary’s anti-Ukraine position during the summit  and said that Prague could simply not afford additional debt.The plan to use frozen Russian assets got bogged down at the summit as De Wever rejected it as legally risky. He warned that it could harm the business of Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial clearing house where 193 billion euros ($226 billion) in frozen assets are held.Belgium was rattled last Friday when Russia’s Central Bank launched a lawsuit against Euroclear to prevent any loan being provided to Ukraine using its money.But while the reparations loan was set aside  using frozen assets remains on the table.The EU has said the assets will remain frozen until Russia has paid war reparations to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that would cost over 600 billion euros ($700 billion.)“If Russia does not pay reparations we will — in full accordance with international law — make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan ” Merz said.EU leaders agreed that “this loan would be repaid by Ukraine only once Russia compensates Ukraine for the damage caused by its war of aggression. Until then  Russia’s assets will remain immobilized and the EU reserves the right to use them to repay the loan  in accordance with EU and international law ” according to a statement.Council president Costa said that the EU “reserves its right to make use of the immobilized assets to repay this loan.”Few believe Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay reparations  so the assets could well remain in Europe and make their way to Ukraine.At a press conference on Friday in Warsaw  Zelenskyy said the loan gives Ukraine “financial certainty for the coming years” and said it would be spent on either reconstruction or arms.“If Russia drags out this war — and that is exactly the signal the entire world hears from Moscow  as they continue to threaten us — we will use these funds for defense  if the war continues ” he said. ""If the world compels Russia to make peace  we will use these funds exclusively for the reconstruction of our country.”___Associated Press writers Karel Janicek in Prague  Justin Spike in Budapest  and Illia Novikov contributed to this report.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['new $106 billion loan', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš', 'Prime Minister Bart de Wever', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Polish President Karol Nawrocki', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'gigantic economic recovery fund', 'leader Viktor Orbán', 'International Monetary Fund', 'official welcome ceremony', 'The European Council', 'next two years', 'European Union leaders', 'massive interest-free loan', 'summit two proposals', 'new $106 billion loan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU foundational treaty', 'reparations loan” plan', 'Czech Republic', 'European Commission', 'economic needs', 'four years', 'financial fallout', 'financial burdens', 'Russian retaliation', 'frozen assets', 'reparations loans', '210 billion euros', '137 billion euros', '750 billion euro', 'billion HUF', '193 billion euros', 'zero-interest loan', 'loan package', 'Presidential Palace', 'AP Photo', 'Czarek Sokolowski', '27-nation bloc', 'capital markets', 'infrastructure repairs', 'first plan', 'first option', 'second option', 'safer solution', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Large borrowing', 'closest ally', 'double victory', 'Hungarian families', 'anti-Ukraine position', 'Central Bank', 'EU sanctions', '27 EU nations', 'EU treaty', 'total unanimity', 'long night', 'Brussels’ embrace', 'additional debt', 'full-scale war', 'Friday morning', 'military', 'meeting', 'Warsaw', 'Poland', 'Dec.', 'heads', 'state', 'Belgium', 'country', 'alternative', 'government', 'Kyiv', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'money', 'everything', 'ammunition', 'Thursday', 'worth', 'Moscow', 'method', 'funding', 'support', 'two-thirds', 'majority', 'Hungary', 'Article', 'simpler', 'wake', 'hallmark', 'administration', 'countries', 'Slovakia', 'deal', 'protection', 'post', 'X.', 'declaration', 'cost', 'Hungarians', 'cooperation', 'Prague', 'business', 'Euroclear', 'lawsuit', 'tabl']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,abcnews.go.com

Thus  ""central securities depositories can offset any seizure in Russia with frozen or immobilized assets held here "" he said on December 12. For this reason  the EU is not afraid of any future legal proceedings against Russia in international courts (cf. VIN 4408).• However  in addition to the known opposition of Hungary and Slovakia  now Belgium  Bulgaria  Italy  Malta and the Czech Republic have also expressed concerns about ’any haste at the technical level’ that could result in the finalization of the financial package for ’reparation loans’.• Belgium  for its part  is calling for higher guarantees than those proposed by the European Commission. This is one of the stumbling blocks in the ongoing negotiations.• Three successive protections have been considered by the European Commission for the repayment of the ""repair loan""  if it were to be repaid to Russia:– On a voluntary basis  Member States will provide public guarantees for their participation in the EU budget and will have to cover the share of non-participating countries. The European Commission has proposed to increase these guarantees to €210 billion  half of which must be materialized before any of the seized funds can be transferred to Kiev. In reality  if Russia were to file a lawsuit and win  it would be entitled to claim much more in damages.No one therefore knows how much money would need to be covered  especially since the EU already collects and spends the interest generated by these funds. However  no one is prepared to sign a blank check.– A second financial protection has been provided in case the first one does not work or is insufficient: a liquidity mechanism will be put in place so that a country that does not manage to provide the necessary funds can borrow them from the EU.– Finally  a third protection will be introduced in the event that the first two fail: the possibility for the EU to provide other debt instruments allowing financial institutions to honor their financial commitment to the Bank of Russia.• Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen said she would vote in favor of the repair loan and urged her colleagues not to take Belgium’s opinion into account.• According to director of the Russian Centre for Social Economy Research Alexey Zubets  if the EU has failed to confiscate Russian assets over the past three years  it is unlikely to find a solution now. There can’t be no long-term and stable funding for Ukraine at the expense of Russia.• From the start the EU considered that Russia was in the wrong  that it was waging a war of conquest of its own making  and that it was going to lose it. It welcomed the International Criminal Court’s issuance of an international arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and expected to bring the Russian economy to its knees.Oblivious to the fact that Russia has been following international law  that it was applying United Nations Security Council Resolution 2202  that its army has new weapons far superior to its own  and that the Russian economy is indeed thriving.A US recognized Russian victory could have significant financial consequences for the European Union and even ruin it.",neutral,0.01,0.85,0.14,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Billion', 'United Nations Security Council Resolution', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'central securities depositories', 'Three successive protections', 'other debt instruments', 'past three years', 'International Criminal Court', 'international arrest warrant', 'significant financial consequences', 'future legal proceedings', 'second financial protection', 'Social Economy Research', 'The European Commission', 'European financial institutions', 'Russian public assets', 'international courts', 'financial package', 'third protection', 'financial commitment', 'international law', 'Russian Centre', 'Russian economy', 'Russian victory', 'European Commissioner', 'European Union', 'Russian assets', 'public guarantees', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'sovereign immunity', 'Czech Republic', 'technical level', 'reparation loans', 'stumbling blocks', 'ongoing negotiations', 'repair loan', 'voluntary basis', 'Member States', 'participating countries', 'blank check', 'liquidity mechanism', 'Prime Minister', 'Mette Frederiksen', 'Alexey Zubets', 'stable funding', 'new weapons', 'higher guarantees', 'first one', 'necessary funds', 'EU budget', 'Latvia', 'Bank', 'CSDs', 'Euroclear', 'principle', 'seizure', 'December', 'reason', 'VIN', 'addition', 'opposition', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Belgium', 'Bulgaria', 'Italy', 'Malta', 'concerns', 'haste', 'finalization', 'repayment', 'participation', 'share', 'half', 'Kiev', 'reality', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'money', 'interest', 'case', 'place', 'country', 'event', 'possibility', 'Denmark', 'favor', 'colleagues', 'opinion', 'account', 'director', 'long-term', 'Ukraine', 'expense', 'start', 'conquest', 'making', 'issuance', 'knees', 'fact', 'army']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,voltairenet.org

The talks focused on a proposal to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian state assets to cover Ukraine's financing needs.But legal concerns kept some EU members from signing on to the proposal. Instead  agreement was found for the loan  which will be based on borrowing on the capital markets backed by ""EU budget headroom "" a term used to describe extra borrowing capacity.""After lengthy discussions  it is clear that the reparations loans will require more work as leaders need more time to go through the details "" one EU official told RFE/RL.Funding for Ukraine has become a major issue for the 27-member bloc  with the United States choking off its financial support while countries such as Hungary push for curbs on funding as well.On the other side  Poland likened the situation to a choice between ""money today or blood tomorrow.""The EU summit came after Russian President Vladimir Putin crudely criticized the bloc's leaders  using a word that can be translated as ""young swine "" and reiterated assertions that Moscow will achieve the goals of its war on Ukraine by force if a US push for peace does not produce a deal that meets its demands.Putin is scheduled to hold his annual press conference later on December 19 where he is likely to talk about the asset proposal.

As part of the carve-out deal  the Commission will propose a so-called enhanced cooperation early next week  giving the 24 countries a legal platform to raise joint debt.Many of the hallmarks of the €210 billion financing package for Ukraine will be transferred to the new plan for common debt. These include payout structures in tranches  anti-corruption safeguards  and an outline for how much money should be spent on Kyiv’s military and the country’s budgetary needs.European governments resorted to joint debt after failing to agree on a controversial plan to leverage frozen Russian assets across the bloc.The new plan would provide Ukraine with €45 billion next year  handing Kyiv a crucial lifeline as it enters its fifth year of fighting. The remaining funds would be disbursed in 2027.Cost of borrowingThe new plan won’t come cheap. The EU is expected to pay €3 billion annually in interest from 2028 through its seven-year budget  which is largely financed by EU governments  senior Commission officials told reporters on Friday. Interest payments would begin in 2027  but would cost only €1 billion that year.Ukraine will only have to repay the loan once Russia ends the war and pays war reparations. That seems unlikely  which means the EU could continuously roll over the debt or use frozen Russian assets to repay it.That would require another political agreement among EU leaders  as Belgium is strongly opposed to using the frozen assets  most of which are held in the Brussels-based financial depository Euroclear.It was Belgium’s resistance that ultimately forced leaders to pursue common debt.

However  the landmark pledge stopped short of allocating billions of dollars’ worth of frozen Russian assets to Kyiv  concluding (at least  for now) a major flash point that has divided the 27-nation bloc.Without the EU’s loan  Ukraine was on track to run out of funding in the spring. According to the International Monetary Fund  Kyiv needs $161 billion in 2026 and 2027 to effectively combat Russia; otherwise  Ukraine would be forced to slash drone production. But Friday’s approved loan prevented this concern from becoming a reality—covering roughly two-thirds of Kyiv’s financial needs.“It is a signal to the Russians that there is no point for them to continue the war because we have financial support  and therefore  we will not collapse on the front line ” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X on Friday.EU leaders also argued that European support for Ukraine is vital to prevent future Russian aggression against the rest of the continent. “We have a simple choice: either money today  or blood tomorrow ” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday.EU member states agreed to use the bloc’s own budget as collateral instead of allocating frozen Russian assets in Europe  totaling roughly $247 billion  to pay for the loan. Although several European countries  including Ukraine  campaigned for the use of the immobilized Russian funds  Belgium refused to back this plan  arguing that it failed to adequately protect Brussels from potential legal and financial risks; around $226 billion worth of Russia’s Europe-based assets are held by Belgian company Euroclear  which Russia’s central bank has already brought a lawsuit against in a Russian court.On Friday  the European Union said these assets will remain blocked until Russia pays for Ukraine’s war reparations. The World Bank estimates that the cost of reconstruction over the coming decade will be at least $524 billion—or almost three times Kyiv’s economic output in 2024.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that “if Russia does not pay reparations we will—in full accordance with international law—make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan.”Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced this proposal on Friday as “daylight robbery ” suggesting that “the consequences could be grave” for the countries that authorize it.Not every EU member state is on board with the loan  though  with the Czech Republic  Hungary  and Slovakia all initially opposed. “I would not like a European Union in war ” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said  adding that “to give money means war.” The leaders of all three countries have been described as allies of Putin.However  on Friday  Orban  Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis  and Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico ultimately decided not to block the loan’s passage in exchange for protections from any financial fallout—risking their relationships with Russia to avoid further dissent within the European bloc.Today’s Most ReadWhat We’re FollowingGetting guns off the streets. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a buyback program on Friday to “get guns off our streets.” The initiative comes in response to the Bondi Beach mass shooting in Sydney on Sunday  during which two suspected gunmen whom investigators believe may have been inspired by Islamic State ideology killed 15 worshippers and injured dozens more at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration.One of the suspected gunmen held a firearm license and owned six guns “in spite of living in the middle of Sydney’s suburbs ” Albanese said. “There’s no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns.” Australia also issued a buyback program following the country’s 1996 mass shooting  which experts say melted down as many as 1 million firearms.Under the proposal  the Australian government would pay gun owners to surrender “surplus  newly banned and illegal firearms.” The initiative adds to other proposed measures aimed at tightening the country’s already strict gun laws  including imposing a limit on the number and types of firearms that an individual can own. Albanese has also vowed to further combat antisemitism by increasing penalties on those convicted of spreading “hate  division and radicalisation.” The buyback program must still be approved by lawmakers. Australian opposition leader Sussan Ley called on Albanese on Friday to recall Parliament before Christmas to pass the legislation.Violent nationwide protests. Bangladeshi officials urged for calm on Friday after mass  violent protests swept the country over the killing of a youth protest leader. Sharif Osman Hadi  32  was prepared to launch his parliamentary campaign ahead of elections planned for February 2026 when he was shot in Bangladesh’s capital  Dhaka  last week. Hadi was a prominent figure of the student-led movement that ousted then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last August and a vocal critic of India’s political influence on Bangladesh. Medical and party officials confirmed Hadi’s death late Thursday after he spent six days on life support.Coming on the heels of another nationwide Bangladeshi demonstration this week against New Delhi’s decision to host Hasina during her self-imposed exile  interim leader Muhammad Yunus warned on Friday that recent instability—including arson attacks on journalists—could undermine February’s parliamentary elections.“This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition ” the interim government said in a statement. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.”TikTok’s new owners. TikTok’s Chinese owner  ByteDance  reportedly signed binding agreements with three major investors to form a new U.S. joint venture to own the app  according to an internal memo by TikTok CEO Shou Chew that was seen by Bloomberg on Thursday. The deal—expected to close on Jan. 22  2026—will allow the popular U.S. social media app to continue operating in the United States  a future once considered uncertain due to its ties to Beijing.Last year  the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance’s divestiture from TikTok over fears that the app’s user data could be accessed by the Chinese government and therefore posed a national security threat. At the time  ByteDance owned 100 percent of TikTok’s shares. Trump signed an executive order during his first term effectively banning TikTok and vowed to further crack down on its U.S. presence this year. However  a deal to transfer TikTok ownership to U.S. companies proved more challenging than anticipated  requiring months of negotiations and several monthslong extensions.Under the new consortium  nearly half of TikTok will be owned by a group of non-Chinese investors. The U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake investment companies as well as the Emirati firm MGX will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s shares; U.S. user data  including TikTok’s personalized algorithm  will be stored locally in an Oracle-run system. ByteDance will retain a 19.9 percent stake  with another 30.1 percent held by ByteDance affiliates. It is unclear who will own the remaining 5 percent of the company.What in the World?José Antonio Kast won Chile’s presidential election runoff on Sunday. What is Kast’s political alignment?A.

An estimated $217 billion of $246 billion in frozen Russian central bank funds are held in Belgium at its Euroclear clearing house. But the Guardian reports Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever stopped the plan  warning Moscow “would retaliate  and that courts in Russia-friendly jurisdictions  such as China  could order Belgian assets to be seized.”Fiscal forecast: The EU’s $105 billion loan is about two-thirds of what Ukraine “is thought to need to stay afloat over the next two years ” the BBC reports.Meanwhile  multiple European nations announced $45 billion in military aid for Ukraine after a meeting of the so-called Ramstein Group on Wednesday  the Kyiv Post reports.Germany vowed more than $13 billion  including air-defense equipment as well as drones and artillery shells. The Brits  too  vowed additional air-defense assets and counter-drone systems. Canada announced $50 million in missiles and drone equipment and another $200 million in U.S. equipment to be purchased for Ukraine. The Dutch said they’ve set aside more than $800 million for drone equipment. Norway vowed to send missiles for Ukraine’s F-16 aircraft. Denmark vowed about $167 million for drones and air-defense. Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Montenegro  New Zealand  Poland  Portugal and the Czech Republic also vowed new military aid to Ukraine.In case you were curious  “under Trump’s control  the US contributed a goose egg” at the Wednesday meeting  the Kyiv Post reports.

The strike targeted a single boat and killed four people as they were traveling somewhere “along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific ” SOUTHCOM said with an accompanying video of the attack.War crime in DOD’s boat strikes? Sen. Wicker sees none. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker  R-Miss.  said Thursday after a classified briefing this week that SOUTHCOM’s war on maritime drug traffickers is being “conducted based on sound legal advice ” despite allegations to the contrary following Washington Post reporting the Pentagon killed two survivors after their initial strike on Sept. 2.“I have seen no evidence of war crimes ” Wicker said in a statement Thursday. “After participating in the various briefings provided by the administration  I am confident that the strikes that have taken place thus far against narco-terrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of operations were conducted based on sound legal advice ” he said  and claimed  “Each strike has been preceded by a rigorous analysis of extensive intelligence  as well as a thorough legal review.”Wicker’s Democratic counterpart at SASC disagreed  and said in his own statement Thursday that the committee “has been denied basic information  documents  and answers from the Department of Defense about this campaign.” To that end  Ranking Member Jack Reed  D-R.I.  said the military has not yet provided several documents “required by existing law and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 ” including:The relevant Execute Orders;Unedited video of all strikes;Updated legal and policy framework reports;All audio  transcripts  and chat logs between commanders  aircraft  and others from the Sept. 2nd attacks;Regular staff briefings;Responses to dozens of written follow-up questions; andUpdated costs for SOUTHCOM’s Southern Spear campaign.Reed and other SASC and HASC lawmakers were shown video of the Sept. 2 strikes on Wednesday after the Post’s reporting raised concern among experts and critics on Capitol Hill that the U.S. military had possibly violated the laws of war in a campaign of alleged extrajudicial killings. Several lawmakers want the video released so the U.S. public can view what their troops are doing as part of President Trump’s war on drug cartels.Trump himself said he would be okay with releasing the full video. A few days later  however  he changed his mind and said  “Whatever [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth wants to do is OK with me.” Hegseth then told reporters Tuesday  “Of course we're not going to release a top secret full unedited video of that to the general public.”Sen. Chris Murphy disagreed with Hegseth’s characterization. “There's nothing ‘top secret’ about the second strike if there wasn't anything top secret about the first one ” said Murphy  D-Conn.  and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  writing on social media Thursday.A note on strategy: The Pentagon’s counter-boat campaign developed only after the White House’s desired war on Mexican drug cartels turned up too few targets  the Post reported Thursday. Trump promised a war on those cartels during his 2024 campaign; but once he took office  at least some cartels responded and conditions reportedly changed—which caused the White House to change its focus. According to the Post  “as the administration surged thousands of U.S. troops to the southern border  increased U.S. surveillance flights and boosted intelligence sharing with its neighbor  Mexican military operations across the border curbed cartel action ” current and former U.S. officials said.”That left [Trump’s homeland security adviser  Stephen Miller] and his team looking for another target.”“When you hope and wait for something to develop that doesn’t  you start looking at countries south of Mexico ” a U.S. official said. The result was SOUTHCOM’s campaign targeting drug-trafficking boats off the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Latin America  which has killed at least 99 people to date  according to the U.S. military. Trump’s executive order for that campaign “contains targeting criteria lifted from the language of the counterterrorism campaign against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State  which some current and former officials say give the Pentagon an overly permissive license to kill ” the Post reported  and notes  “The Pentagon has not publicly identified those killed  and it is unclear whether it has collected the intelligence to do so.” Continue reading  here.Another consideration: “Trump's Venezuela embargo could put Taiwan at risk ” Reuters reported Thursday after a think-tanker flagged a possible “propaganda opening” for China. “When Washington blurs terms  it weakens its ability to call out coercion elsewhere ” Craig Singleton  a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington  told Reuters. But he wasn’t alone.“Ultimately  the U.S. is doing a lot of damage to the normative quality of the rules ” Isaac Kardon of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said. “That is a major blow to the credibility of international law to restrain other actors.” At least one other expert was not quite as concerned.

54436,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/eu-agrees-90-billion-loan-to-ukraine-but-squabbles-over-frozen-russian-assets-expose-the-blocs-deep-divisions-272095,EU agrees €90 billion loan to Ukraine  but squabbles over frozen Russian assets expose the bloc’s deep divisions,To placate pro-Moscow governments in Hungary  Slovakia and Czechia  the EU had to include an ‘opt-out’ clause for its support for Ukraine.,By agreeing to provide a loan of €90 billion (£79 billion) for the years 2026-2027  EU leaders have set the direction for the future of support for Ukraine.At stake at the meeting of the European Council on December 18 was not just Kyiv’s ability to continue to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing aggression  but also the credibility of the EU as a player in the future of European security.The key decision for the EU’s leaders was whether  and how  they would provide financial support for Ukraine over the next two years. Europeans have provided a vital drip-feed of ongoing financial assistance to Kyiv throughout almost four years of war.But they have also struggled to fill  in its entirety  the hole created by the withdrawal of US support since the return of Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025.The estimated €136 billion of budget support needed by Ukraine in 2026 and 2027 is a relatively fixed figure regardless of whether any peace initiative comes to fruition. A large part of it – €52 billion in 2026 and €33 billion in 2027 – is for military support.The EU-agreed loan of €90 billion  “based on EU borrowing on the capital markets backed by the EU budget headroom”  thus covers at least the essential military needs of Ukraine. The loan will either contribute to the ongoing war effort or help create a sufficiently large and credible defence force to deter any future aggression by Russia.Brussels is now the most important financial partner for Ukraine by any measure.To fund the support the EU wants to provide to Ukraine  the commission developed two proposals. The most widely supported – and ultimately rejected – proposal was to use the Russian assets held by the Belgium-based Euroclear exchange as collateral to for a loan to fund Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction over the next few years.In view of Belgian opposition because of insufficient protections against likely Russian retaliation  the European Commission had also proposed joint EU borrowing to fund support for Kyiv. Despite resistance from a group of EU member states  it was the only agreeable solution at the end.The agreement on a loan to Ukraine funded from EU borrowing achieves the primary goal of securing at least a modicum of budgetary stability for Kyiv. But it came at the price of EU unity.An “opt-out clause” had to be provided for Hungary  Slovakia and Czechia. All three countries are governed by deeply Euro-sceptical and Russia-leaning parties.The deep irony is that by opposing EU support for Ukraine  they expose Ukrainians to a fate similar to that they suffered when the Soviet Union suppressed pro-democracy uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and then Czechoslovakia in 1968.The EU until now managed to maintain a relatively united front on sanctions against Russia  on political  economic and military support for Ukraine  and on strengthening its own defence posture and defence-industrial base.Over the past year  these efforts have accelerated in response to Trump’s return to the White House. This has shifted the US position to one which is in equal measure more America first and more pro-Russia than under any previous US administration.And the pressure on Kyiv and Brussels has increased significantly over the past few weeks.First there was the 28-point peace plan  which may have been a US-led proposal  but read as if it was Kremlin-approved. Then the new US national security strategy  which gave significantly more space to criticisms of Europe than to condemnation of Russia for the war in Ukraine.EPA/Sergei IlnitskyNo longer casting Russia as a threat to international security shows how detached the US has become from reality and the transatlantic alliance.Russia’s president  Vladimir Putin  keeps insisting that he will achieve his war aims of fully annexing another four Ukrainian regions – in addition to Crimea – by force or diplomacy. Giving his usually optimistic outlook on Russia’s military and economic strength  Putin reiterated these points at his annual press conference on December 19.EU divisions widenIn light of how squeezed Brussels and Kyiv now are between Washington and Moscow  the agreement on EU financing for Ukraine  despite its flaws and the acrimony it has caused within the EU  is a significant milestone in terms of the EU gaining more control over its future security. But it is not a magic wand resolving Europe’s broader problems of finding its place and defining its role in a new international order.The agreement reached at the summit between the EU’s leaders on how to financially support Ukraine was overshadowed by their failure to overcome disagreement on signing a trade agreement with the South American trade group  Mercosur.A decision on this trade deal with Argentina  Bolivia  Brazil  Paraguay  Uruguay and (currently suspended) Venezuela had been 25 years in the making. The deal was due to be signed on December 20  but this has now been postponed until January.This is meant to provide time for additional negotiations to assuage opponents of the deal in its current form  especially France  Italy and Poland  who fear that cheaper imports from Mercosur countries will hurt European farmers. Those farmers staged a fiery protest at the European parliament ahead of the European Council meeting.The delay does not derail the trade deal  which aims to create one of the world’s largest free trade areas. But it severely dents the EU’s claim to leadership of an international multilateral trading system based on rules that prioritise mutual benefit  as an alternative to the Trump administration’s unpredictable and punitive America-first trade practices.Both disagreements continue to hamper the EU’s capacity for a decisive international role more generally. Where Trump’s US offers unpredictability  Brussels for now only offers extended procrastination on key decisions.This places limits on the confidence that the EU’s would-be partners in a new international order can have in its ability to lead the shrinking number of liberal democracies. Without skilled and determined leadership  they will struggle to survive – let alone thrive – in a world carved up between Washington  Moscow and Beijing.,neutral,0.02,0.73,0.25,negative,0.0,0.13,0.87,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', '€90 billion loan', 'deep divisions', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'squabbles', 'bloc', 'new US national security strategy', 'South American trade group', 'new international order', 'Belgium-based Euroclear exchange', 'annual press conference', 'important financial partner', 'previous US administration', '28-point peace plan', 'four Ukrainian regions', 'ongoing financial assistance', 'essential military needs', 'EU member states', 'ongoing war effort', 'EU budget headroom', 'joint EU borrowing', 'credible defence force', 'next two years', 'international security', 'European security', 'ongoing aggression', 'US position', 'peace initiative', 'two proposals', 'financial support', 'US support', 'future security', 'budget support', 'four years', 'European Council', 'vital drip', 'White House', 'fixed figure', 'capital markets', 'Russian assets', 'Belgian opposition', 'insufficient protections', 'Russian retaliation', 'agreeable solution', 'primary goal', 'budgetary stability', 'three countries', 'Russia-leaning parties', 'deep irony', 'Soviet Union', 'pro-democracy uprisings', 'united front', 'political, economic', 'defence posture', 'defence-industrial base', 'Sergei Ilnitsky', 'transatlantic alliance', 'optimistic outlook', 'economic strength', 'significant milestone', 'magic wand', 'broader problems', 'trade deal', 'additional negotiations', 'current form', 'trade agreement', 'EU unity', 'EU divisions', 'EU financing', 'war aims', 'military support', 'key decision', 'Donald Trump', 'large part', 'future aggression', 'European Commission', 'past year', 'equal measure', 'US-led proposal', 'Vladimir Putin', 'EU support', 'EU-agreed loan', 'EU leaders', '25 years', 'direction', 'Ukraine', 'stake', 'meeting', 'December', 'Kyiv', 'credibility', 'player', 'Europeans', 'feed', 'entirety', 'hole', 'withdrawal', 'return', 'January', 'fruition', 'Brussels', 'collateral', 'reconstruction', 'view', 'resistance', 'end', 'modicum', 'price', 'clause', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Czechia', 'Euro-sceptical', 'Ukrainians', 'fate', 'similar', 'sanctions', 'efforts', 'response', 'pressure', 'weeks', 'space', 'criticisms', 'condemnation', 'EPA', 'threat', 'reality', 'president', 'Crimea', 'diplomacy', 'points', 'light', 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'flaws', 'acrimony', 'terms', 'control', 'place', 'role', 'summit', 'failure', 'disagreement', 'Mercosur', 'Argentina', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil', 'Paraguay', 'Uruguay', 'Venezuela', 'making', 'time', 'opponents']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,theconversation.com

The talks focused on a proposal to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian state assets to cover Ukraine's financing needs.But legal concerns kept some EU members from signing on to the proposal. Instead  agreement was found for the loan  which will be based on borrowing on the capital markets backed by ""EU budget headroom "" a term used to describe extra borrowing capacity.""After lengthy discussions  it is clear that the reparations loans will require more work as leaders need more time to go through the details "" one EU official told RFE/RL.Funding for Ukraine has become a major issue for the 27-member bloc  with the United States choking off its financial support while countries such as Hungary push for curbs on funding as well.On the other side  Poland likened the situation to a choice between ""money today or blood tomorrow.""The EU summit came after Russian President Vladimir Putin crudely criticized the bloc's leaders  using a word that can be translated as ""young swine "" and reiterated assertions that Moscow will achieve the goals of its war on Ukraine by force if a US push for peace does not produce a deal that meets its demands.Putin is scheduled to hold his annual press conference later on December 19 where he is likely to talk about the asset proposal. Russia had threatened massive legal action over any usage of its frozen assets.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attended the summit  telling leaders the proposal of a loan backed by the frozen Russia assets currently held in the EU is preferable  but that ultimately it doesn't matter how the funds are utilized  just as long as a solution is found.“If in the spring  Ukraine does not receive the corresponding tranche -- which  in the event of peace  will be used for the country’s reconstruction  and in the event of continued war  for other priorities  above all drone production -- Ukraine’s drone production will be reduced several fold ” he told reporters at a press conference after addressing the summit behind closed doors.Ukraine currently faces a foreign aid shortfall of some $53 billion to $59 billion next year  he added.Western countries have supported the war-torn country with both direct budgetary support and military aid since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly four years ago  but the upcoming period may be different.The United States has signaled that it most likely won’t send more cash  putting the onus on the EU and other G7 countries to step up -- and to do so soon.Some 140 billion euros ($165 billion) of Russian state assets are held in the Belgian-based financial markets company Euroclear  while an additional 25 billion euros of Russian state assets are held in banks across the EU  mainly in France but also in a Belgian private bank  Cyprus  and Germany.The reparations loan is part of a wider financial package that is worth up to 210 billion euros  according to the European Commission. This also includes 45 billion euros that will be used to repay a G7 loan to Ukraine from 2024.While most of the EU's 27 members are in favor of using the assets to back the loan  Belgium fears the plan could leave it legally vulnerable  and other countries including Italy have also expressed doubts.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said she would not leave the summit without agreement on how to finance Ukraine over the next two years.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz issued a stark warning earlier this week  saying failure would mean ""the European Union's ability to act will be severely damaged for years  if not longer  and we will show the world that we are incapable of standing together and acting at such a crucial moment in our history.""In a combative speech at an annual Defense Ministry event on December 17  Putin sought to blame Europe and Ukraine in advance for any failure of the peace efforts  saying that Russia will take more land by force if Kyiv and European leaders he described as ""young swine"" do not take the right approach to US proposals.""If the opposing side and their foreign patrons refuse to engage in substantive discussions  Russia will achieve the liberation of its historical lands by military means "" Putin said  pouring cold water on any proposal that calls for Moscow to make territorial concessions.Moscow currently controls nearly one-fifth of Ukraine  and Russian officials have repeatedly said they won't compromise on the five Ukrainian regions that Putin baselessly claims are Russian.A particular sticking point in the weeks-long flurry of negotiations involving the US  Ukraine  Europe  and Russia has been the portion of the Donetsk region that Ukrainian forces still hold.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Frozen Assets Plan Stalls', '€90 Billion Loan', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy', 'Belgian-based financial markets company', 'annual Defense Ministry event', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'five Ukrainian regions', 'The European Union', 'Belgian private bank', 'wider financial package', 'particular sticking point', 'frozen Russian assets', 'annual press conference', 'massive legal action', 'direct budgetary support', 'extra borrowing capacity', 'foreign aid shortfall', 'The United States', 'next two years', 'EU budget headroom', 'one EU official', 'additional 25 billion euros', 'frozen Russia assets', 'billion) interest-free loan', 'other G7 countries', 'frozen assets', 'financial support', 'Russian officials', 'capital markets', 'European leaders', 'legal concerns', 'military aid', 'foreign patrons', 'other side', 'other priorities', 'other countries', '140 billion euros', '45 billion euros', 'G7 loan', 'military needs', 'coming years', 'financing needs', 'lengthy discussions', 'reparations loans', 'major issue', 'young swine', 'corresponding tranche', 'drone production', 'several fold', 'closed doors', 'Western countries', 'full-scale invasion', 'upcoming period', 'stark warning', 'crucial moment', 'combative speech', 'right approach', 'opposing side', 'substantive discussions', 'historical lands', 'military means', 'cold water', 'territorial concessions', 'weeks-long flurry', 'EU officials', 'war-torn country', 'US push', 'US proposals', '27-member bloc', 'continued war', 'peace efforts', 'EU members', 'asset proposal', 'EU summit', '210 billion', '27 members', '90 billion-euro ($', 'Kyiv', 'Ukraine', 'economic', 'post', 'December', 'funds', 'solution', 'funding', 'talks', 'tens', 'billions', 'agreement', 'term', 'work', 'time', 'details', 'RFE/RL', 'Hungary', 'curbs', 'Poland', 'situation', 'choice', 'money', 'blood', 'word', 'assertions', 'Moscow', 'goals', 'force', 'deal', 'demands', 'usage', 'spring', 'reconstruction', 'reporters', 'cash', 'onus', 'Euroclear', 'banks', 'France', 'Cyprus', 'Germany', 'favor', 'Belgium', 'plan', 'Italy', 'doubts', 'failure', 'ability', 'world', 'history', 'advance', 'liberation', 'one-fifth', 'negotiations']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,oilprice.com
54438,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/trump-claims-talks-getting-close-to-something-ahead-of-us-meeting-with-russians/a144660963.html,Trump claims talks ‘getting close to something’ ahead of US meeting with Russians,US president Donald Trump yesterday said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are “getting close to something” ahead of a US meeting with Russian officials this weekend.,European leaders seek deal on use of frozen Kremlin assets to fund KyivUS president Donald Trump yesterday said he believes talks toward ending the war in Ukraine are “getting close to something” ahead of a US meeting with Russian officials this weekend.During an Oval Office event  Mr Trump told reporters: “I hope Ukraine moves quickly.”Mr Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner plan to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend  a White House official said  as they continue trying to coax an agreement out of both Russia and Ukraine to end Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.Mr Witkoff and Mr Kushner met a Ukrainian delegation over two days in Berlin last Sunday and Monday and US officials said they came away with a belief that the two sides are not far apart  although the thorniest issue  Russia’s insistence on gaining Ukrainian territory in any settlement  remains outstanding.Opinion polls in Ukraine have shown that few Ukrainians are willing to accept territorial concessions  which remain a key Russian condition for ending its war. The Russians have shown little willingness to compromise on their demands.“I hope Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there ” Mr Trump said  an apparent reference to recent Russian gains on the battlefield.Ukraine could receive security guarantees modelled on Nato’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge under a proposed peace deal with Russia – an unprecedented offer aimed at ending the war sparked by Moscow’s 2022 invasion.Meanwhile  European Union leaders were last night trying to overcome differences on plans to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine’s war effort at a summit seen as a critical test of the bloc’s strength.Now we have a simple choice – either money today or blood tomorrowTalks in Brussels focused on seeking to reassure Belgium  which holds most of these frozen assets  and several other concerned countries that Europe would share the legal and financial risks  in a bid to secure their backing for the plan.“Now we have a simple choice – either money today or blood tomorrow ” Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said  urging fellow EU leaders to agree to the proposal. “All European leaders have to finally rise to this occasion.”The EU sees Russia’s war as a threat to its own security and wants to keep Ukraine financed and fighting.With public finances across the EU already strained by high debt levels  the European Commission has proposed using frozen Russian central bank assets that are mostly held in Belgian clearing house Euroclear to secure a huge loan to Kyiv.But Belgium is deeply concerned about being left exposed to legal and financial risks  and other states including Italy have also expressed worries.Several EU leaders arriving at the summit said it was imperative they find a solution. They were also keen to show European countries’ strength and resolve after Mr Trump last week called them “weak”.“We just can’t afford to fail ” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said  adding that leaders would stay at the summit as long as needed to find a solution.Mr Tusk said leaders agreed that they should work on a loan rather than other options  but stressed that they had many hours of increasingly technical discussions ahead of them.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky  who took part in the summit  urged the bloc to agree on a deal he said would allow Ukraine to keep fighting.The Russians – and not only them – will feel that Europe can be defeated“The decision now on the table – the decision to fully use Russian assets to defend against Russian aggression – is one of the clearest and most morally justified decisions that could ever be made ” he said.“If this decision isn’t made now  the Russians – and not only them – will feel that Europe can be defeated.”Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever told his country’s parliament early yesterday that he had not yet seen guarantees that answered his concerns on legal and liquidity risks and that financing plans were still changing “as we speak”.Russia’s central bank has said the EU plans to use its assets are illegal. It filed a lawsuit in Moscow this week seeking $230bn (€196bn) in damages from Euroclear.The stakes are high because without the EU’s financial help Ukraine will run out of money in the second quarter of next year and most likely lose the war to Russia  which the EU fears would bring closer the threat of Russian aggression against the bloc.Ms Kallas put the chances of a deal on the assets at 50/50. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said: “My impression is that we can come to an agreement.”The latest draft version of the summit conclusions  which is not yet agreed and could still change substantially  proposes that the leaders take the political decision of going ahead with the reparation loan  and task officials with “urgently” sorting out the details.The draft text specifies the risk would be shared among EU states  among several conditions meant to reassure Belgium and others.Another option could have been for the EU to borrow the needed amount against the security of the EU budget and then lend the money to Ukraine.But such a move would require unanimity among the 27 EU countries and Moscow-friendly Hungary has already said it would veto it.Diplomats said the use of the Russian assets was therefore in practice “the only game in town”.,neutral,0.01,0.94,0.05,mixed,0.12,0.29,0.59,True,English,"['US meeting', 'Trump', 'talks', 'something', 'Russians', 'Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever', 'EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas', 'Polish prime minister Donald Tusk', 'Article 5 mutual defence pledge', 'German chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'several other concerned countries', 'US president Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Belgian clearing house', 'Oval Office event', 'White House official', 'high debt levels', 'morally justified decisions', 'key Russian condition', 'recent Russian gains', 'latest draft version', 'frozen Kremlin assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'fellow EU leaders', 'Several EU leaders', 'European Union leaders', 'Ms Kallas', 'Mr Tusk', 'Ukrainian president', 'several conditions', 'frozen assets', 'US meeting', 'other states', 'other options', 'Russian delegation', 'Russian aggression', 'draft text', 'Mr Trump', 'US officials', 'The EU', 'EU fears', 'EU states', 'European leaders', 'European Commission', 'Russian officials', 'Steve Witkoff', 'Jared Kushner', 'Mr Witkoff', 'Mr Kushner', 'Ukrainian delegation', 'two days', 'two sides', 'thorniest issue', 'Ukrainian territory', 'Opinion polls', 'territorial concessions', 'little willingness', 'apparent reference', 'unprecedented offer', 'critical test', 'simple choice', 'financial risks', 'public finances', 'many hours', 'technical discussions', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'liquidity risks', 'financial help', 'second quarter', 'next year', 'EU plans', 'The Russians', 'huge loan', 'financing plans', 'reparation loan', 'peace deal', 'political decision', 'summit conclusions', 'war effort', 'security guarantees', 'Kyiv', 'talks', 'Ukraine', 'something', 'reporters', 'envoys', 'Miami', 'agreement', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Berlin', 'Monday', 'belief', 'insistence', 'settlement', 'Ukrainians', 'demands', 'battlefield', 'Nato', 'differences', 'bloc', 'strength', 'money', 'blood', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'legal', 'bid', 'backing', 'proposal', 'occasion', 'threat', 'Euroclear', 'Italy', 'worries', 'solution', 'resolve', 'part', 'fighting', 'table', 'clearest', 'country', 'parliament', 'concerns', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'stakes', 'chances', 'impression', 'task', 'details', 'others', 'amount']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,independent.ie

EU leaders are meeting to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine  the EU's next multiannual financial framework  the EU enlargement process  and the geoeconomic situation in the European Union.Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk is a pretty blunt talker  particularly when it comes to the threat he feels Russia poses beyond Ukraine to the rest of Europe.The leaders of the European Union’s 27 states were set to spend Thursday evening locked in negotiations about how exactly to fund a major package of financial aid for Ukraine.Tusk did not dance around what he believed was at stake.“Now we have a simple choice. It’s either money today or blood tomorrow  and I’m not talking only about Ukraine  I’m talking about Europe ” the Polish leader told reporters.What he meant was that if Europe could not find a way to throw a financial lifeline to Ukraine  it faced the prospect of Kyiv’s defences collapsing on the battlefield.A total victory would bring Russia to the doorstep of the EU  heightening the chances of Moscow considering an attack on an eastern member state.Discussions centred on a proposed €90 billion loan for Ukraine  backed by a mountain of Russian state cash that has been “frozen” inside the EU since the start of the war.The plan is seen as Europe’s best hope of preventing Ukraine from running out of money by the middle of next year. Such a crisis scenario would undermine Kyiv’s efforts to hold off the grinding Russian advance  in a war heading towards its fifth year.The vast majority of the Russian assets are on ice in Euroclear  a Belgian financial institution that acts as a depository for government bonds.ResistedBelgium has resisted the EU push for a loan funded by the assets. It fears Russia will retaliate in the courts  or target Belgian companies operating in countries friendly with Moscow.Luc Frieden  Luxembourg’s prime minister  said the proposal was something that had never been done before. “If we take a European decision that affects one member state  we need to share the risk. We don’t know how Russia might react ” he said.Technical talks have been going on for weeks to provide the Belgian government with solid assurances EU states will jointly cover the cost of any legal or financial fallout.The Belgian government is looking for “unlimited” guarantees  something EU officials have said is not legally possible.The EU would need a sizeable majority of the 27 leaders to approve the frozen asset loan. However  several governments said they would not be comfortable going forward without Belgium on board.A second option  for the EU to fund a loan to Kyiv by borrowing the money as a bloc  would need the approval of all 27 capitals. Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orban said he will not agree to joint EU borrowing.The advantage of a loan backed by Russia’s assets was that it could not be vetoed by Orban.A growing number of leaders see the Hungarian as a hostile force working against the union’s interest. Something will have to be done about that if Orban wins another term in April elections.This European Council summit swings on the position of another leader  Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever. Negotiations to try to bridge the divide between the majority and Belgium were expected to continue well into Thursday night.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he would prefer if Russia was made to pay for the loan  but ultimately Kyiv just needed the money from somewhere. Zelenskiy  who flew to Brussels to address EU leaders in person  said there had to be a decision before the end of the year.,neutral,0.02,0.69,0.29,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['EU summit', 'Tusk', 'Europe', 'blood', 'aid', 'Ukraine', 'right prime minister Viktor Orban', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'next multiannual financial framework', 'Belgian prime minister', 'eastern member state', 'one member state', 'Bart De Wever', 'Russian state cash', 'grinding Russian advance', 'European Council summit', 'Belgian financial institution', 'EU Council Summit', 'EU enlargement process', 'joint EU borrowing', 'frozen asset loan', 'Polish leader', 'next year', 'financial aid', 'financial lifeline', 'financial fallout', 'Belgian companies', 'Belgian government', 'latest developments', 'geoeconomic situation', 'blunt talker', 'Thursday evening', 'major package', 'simple choice', 'total victory', 'best hope', 'crisis scenario', 'Russian assets', 'government bonds', 'Luc Frieden', 'Technical talks', 'solid assurances', 'unlimited” guarantees', 'several governments', 'second option', 'growing number', 'hostile force', 'April elections', 'Thursday night', 'Ukrainian president', 'European Union', 'EU push', 'EU officials', 'European decision', 'fifth year', 'vast majority', 'sizeable majority', '€90 billion loan', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'EU states', 'EU leaders', '27 states', '27 leaders', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'Ukraine', 'Poland', 'threat', 'rest', 'negotiations', 'stake', 'money', 'blood', 'reporters', 'way', 'prospect', 'Kyiv', 'defences', 'battlefield', 'doorstep', 'chances', 'Moscow', 'attack', 'Discussions', 'mountain', 'start', 'war', 'plan', 'middle', 'efforts', 'Euroclear', 'depository', 'courts', 'countries', 'Luxembourg', 'proposal', 'something', 'risk', 'weeks', 'cost', 'legal', 'board', 'bloc', 'approval', '27 capitals', 'Hungary', 'advantage', 'Hungarian', 'term', 'position', 'divide', 'somewhere', 'person', 'end']",2025-12-19,2025-12-20,irishtimes.com

ITG’s leadership will remain intact  retaining a significant stake in the business and continuing to oversee day-to-day operations. Duncan Heath will remain as Chairman.Financial terms were not disclosed but we understand from sources that the deal values the company at north of $100M. This isn’t the same private equity deal that was speculated in the trades a couple of years ago. Sienna is a more recent partner.ITG has 140 employees  including 60 agents. Jane Epstein  Paul Stevens and Jessica Sykes will continue as Managing Directors.Founded by Vincent Catherine and Hugo d’Avout  Sienna Private Equity is a mid-market European private equity fund with offices in Paris and Milan.

The investigational medicinal product (fidrisertib) was generally well tolerated  with no safety concerns in the trial.“These results are disappointing for the FOP community and patients living with this devastating disease ” said Christelle Huguet  PhD  EVP  Head of Research and Development. “However  we do believe that these data will contribute to the growing body of research on FOP  giving new insights into managing this disease for patients and their care providers. FALKON was a tremendous undertaking by Ipsen  continuing our commitment to FOP. FALKON enrolled 113 patients globally  taking over 5 years to reach this critical milestone. We would like to thank the patients  caregivers  the FOP community and KOLs who dedicated their time to the FALKON trial  it has been a serious commitment to help advance our understanding of FOP.”About FOPFOP is a genetic condition caused by pathogenic variants of the ALK2 kinase that leads to bone formation in soft and connective tissues  like muscles  tendons and ligaments  a process known as HO. Once formed  HO is irreversible. There are limited treatment options for patients with FOP. The average/median age of diagnosis is 5 years old and ultimately FOP shortens the life expectancy to a median of 56 years  with untimely death caused by bone formation around the ribcage  leading to breathing problems and thoracic insufficiency. FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals and approximately 900 people are diagnosed worldwide; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.About fidrisertibFidrisertib is an oral  highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of pathogenic variants of the ALK2 kinase  the underlying root cause of FOP. Fidrisertib has been designed to address the unliganded ALK2 signal as well as BMP and aberrant activin liganded signal during flare up; impacting both flare-up based and non-flare-up based HO formation. Fidrisertib is administered orally (capsule sprinkled on food or dissolved in water) without change in dose during flare-ups.About the FALKON TrialFALKON is the largest Phase II trial in FOP  comprising 3 parts  designed to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of fidrisertib  as a first-line treatment in pediatric and adult patients with FOP. Part A is a global  multi-center  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  3-arm trial  in which 113 patients aged 5 years of age or older with the R206H ACVR1 mutation or other FOP variants associated with progressive HO  were enrolled and randomized to receive either high dose-weight based or low dose weight-based fidrisertib or placebo. The primary endpoint is annualized change from baseline in HO volume. In Part B of the double-blind trial  patients continue their dose of fidrisertib  with the patients on placebo in Part A also randomized to receive either high or low dose fidrisertib. Part C is an extension period for all patients who are responding.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

These transactions include Amber Compounding Pharmacy  a well-established operator in the attractive compounding markets of Singapore and Malaysia  representing Fagron’s second significant step in the APAC region following its earlier acquisition of Bella Corp in Australia  as well as Vepakum  a specialized packaging manufacturer that expands Fagron’s presence into this new vertical in Brazil. The closing of the Vepakum acquisition is conditional on antitrust clearance from the Brazilian competition authorities.Through these acquisitions  Fagron remains firmly committed to advancing its growth strategy  driving operational excellence  and maintaining prudent balance sheet management  key enablers that support sustained value creation and position Fagron for long-term success.The combined businesses are expected to generate approximately €26 million in annual revenue  with an EBITDA margin exceeding Fagron’s current group margin  while the aggregate purchase price amounts to roughly €55 million. This results into an average EV to EBITDA multiple of around 8x.Additionally  the Company has obtained a license for its new Anazao Health facility in Tampa from the California State Board of Pharmacy  enabling the shipment of patient-specific compounded medications to California. This development reinforces Fagron’s presence in one of the largest and most tightly regulated healthcare markets in the United States  further enhancing its ability to serve patients and healthcare providers with high-quality  customized solutions.Amber Compounding PharmacyAmber stands out as a trusted  well-established leader with five strategic locations across Singapore and Malaysia. As one of the region’s leading compounding manufacturers  Amber is uniquely positioned to adopt future sterile compounding practices. Serving a diverse customer base that includes clinics  hospital pharmacies and distributors  the Company delivers solutions to local and international markets and is widely recognised as a driving force in the fast growing per capita compounding segmentVepakumVepakum is a certified company with two facilities in São Paulo  Brazil. It provides high-quality packaging solutions and will allow Fagron to position in this new vertical and deliver scale benefits through joint packaging  distribution and shared services.Licensing UpdateThe California State Board of Pharmacy has granted a license to Anazao Health’s Tampa  Florida facility  authorizing the shipment of compounded medications to California on a prescription-by-prescription basis. This achievement represents a key milestone in building a coast-to-coast nationwide platform for our Health and Wellness business  encompassing both 503A (patient-specific) and 503B (outsourcing) services.This development will enable us to strengthen our operations within North America’s prevention and lifestyle segment and reinforce our presence in California  while also allowing us to discontinue activities at the former Tampa facility. By eliminating overlapping costs and consolidating operations  we will further enhance service levels for our customers.Following the granting of this license  all Fagron facilities in the United States are now authorized to ship compounded medications to California  significantly expanding our reach and operational flexibility.Organisational changeKlaus Röhrig voluntarily stepped down from the Board of Directors on 30 November 2025.

The first tranche consisted of the issuance of 225 convertible bonds (the “First Tranche Bonds”) with a nominal amount of €100 000 each  which were fully subscribed to and paid-up by HCM. Pursuant to the subscription agreement  the Company has paid a subscription fee to HCM equal to 8.0 per cent of the principal amount of the First Tranche Bonds (i.e.  €1.8 million)  which has been satisfied by set-off against the respective portion of the subscription price of the First Tranche Bonds due by HCM.The First Tranche Bonds carry an interest rate of 6.5 per cent per annum and have a three-year maturity from issuance with quarterly amortization payments (each a “Scheduled Amortisation Payment Date”) of principal (equal to an amount of €8.500 per First Tranche Bond  except for the final amortization payment which will be equal to €6.500 per First Tranche Bond  each an “Amortised Payment Amount”) and interest. The first Scheduled Amortisation Payment Date will be on February 18  2026.In addition to the scheduled amortisation payments  HCM (or any future holders of the majority of the First Tranche Bonds) may  at any time between two Scheduled Amortisation Payment Dates (a “Regular Amortisation Period”)  exercise its right to bring forward the payment of up to two Amortised Payment Amounts to a date specified in a notice sent to the Company which shall not be earlier than three business days following the date on which the relevant notice is given. Additionally  HCM (or any future holders of the majority of the First Tranche Bonds) will also have the right to defer the payment of any upcoming Amortised Payment Amount to any subsequent Scheduled Amortisation Payment Date specified in the notice sent to the Company.HCM may elect to convert the outstanding principal amount under the First Tranche Bonds or any Amortized Payment Amount at any time during the term of the bonds. The initial conversion price for the First Tranche Bonds  which can be modified on a downward basis  shall be equal to €5.00  which represents 125 per cent of the placement price of the shares that have been issued pursuant to the previously announced private placement and registered direct offering (the “Capital Increases”).Each payment of the Amortised Payment Amounts shall in principle be done in cash at an amount equal to 103 per cent of the principal amount of such Amortised Payment Amount. However  the Company may elect to satisfy its obligation to repay the relevant Amortised Payment Amount by issuing new ordinary shares in the Company to HCM (the “Share Settlement Option”). In case the Company exercises its Share Settlement Option  the issue price for the newly to be issued ordinary shares will be the lower of (a) the conversion price in effect at the time  and (b) 90% of the lower of (i) the VWAP of an ordinary share on the relevant Scheduled Amortisation Payment Date  and (ii) the lowest of the VWAPs of an ordinary share on each of the five consecutive dealing days ending on (and including) such Scheduled Amortisation Payment Date.More information on the First Tranche Bonds is available in the special report of the board of directors of the Company drawn up in accordance with articles 7:180  7:191 and 7:193 of the Belgian Code on companies and associations located at https://investors.nyxoah.com/financials.Second tranche convertible bondsPursuant to the subscription agreement  the Company has the option to issue a second tranche of convertible bonds (the “Second Tranche Bonds”) to HCM for an aggregate principal amount of up to €22.5 million if so requested by the Company in the period between July 18  2026 and August 18  2026.The Company and HCM can agree in writing to a lesser aggregate principal amount than €22.5 million for the Second Tranche Bonds issuance.The obligation for HCM to subscribe to the Second Tranche Bonds on the closing date for the Second Tranche Bonds (the “Second Tranche Closing Date”) shall be subject to certain customary conditions precedent being satisfied (or waived by HCM) prior to or on the Second Tranche Closing Date. More specifically  it is  among others  required that:the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest whole multiple of U.S.$1.00 (with U.S.$0.50 being rounded upwards)) of the daily traded values of the ordinary shares of the Company on each dealing day comprised in the period of sixty qualifying stock exchange days ending on the qualifying stock exchange date immediately preceding the date of the Company’s request to issue the Second Tranche Bonds is greater than U.S.$1 million (or its equivalent in any other currency); andthe Company has a last market capitalisation immediately preceding the Second Tranche Closing Date  and an average market capitalisation on each of the 30 consecutive dealing days ending on (and including) the dealing day immediately preceding the Second Tranche Closing Date that are each greater than €240 000 000.As of December 16  2025  the conditions precedent relating to the daily traded values  the last market capitalisation and the average market capitalisation were not met. More precisely  as of December 16  2025  the arithmetic mean of the daily traded values amounted to U.S.$ 772 176  the last market capitalisation amounted to €177 053 883 and the 30-day average market capitalisation amounted to €175 959 735.The Second Tranche Bonds shall  to the extent applicable  be issued on substantially the same terms as the First Tranche Bonds. The initial conversion price of the Second Tranche Bonds shall be equal to the lowest of the five VWAPs of the ordinary shares of the Company on Euronext Brussels on each of the five dealing days ending on the Second Tranche Closing Date.Cash runwayThe issuance of the First Tranche Bonds and closing of the Capital Increases  together with the second tranche under the Company’s existing credit facility with the European Investment Bank (for which the possibility to draw depends on a revenue milestone that the Company expects to meet in the first half of 2026)  will extend the Company’s cash runway into the third quarter of 2026. If  in addition to the foregoing  the Second Tranche Bonds are issued  the Company’s cash runway will be extended by two (2) quarters  into the first quarter of 2027.The net proceeds from the First Tranche Bonds together with the net proceeds of the Capital Increases will be used (i) to support commercialization activities in the United States and advance the commercialization of the Genio system in the Company’s initial target markets outside the United States; (ii) to continue gathering clinical data and to support physician-initiated clinical research projects related to OSA patient treatments; (iii) to further finance research and development activities related to Genio system upgrades  re-designing the Company’s products for manufacturability and cost reduction initiatives; (iv) to continue to build a pipeline of new technologies and explore potential collaboration opportunities in the field of monitoring and diagnostics for OSA; and (v) for other general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  working capital  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  should the Company choose to pursue any  and collaborations.This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities  nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state.About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat OSA.

(NASDAQ: PRPH) (""ProPhase"") and Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A. (""ABL"")  a European biotechnology and MedTech group  today announced that they have entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") regarding a proposed reverse merger transaction pursuant to which ABL would become the majority owner of the combined entity (the “Proposed Transaction”).The LOI reflects preliminary understandings only and does not create any obligation to consummate a transaction  except with respect to customary confidentiality and expense provisions. The Proposed Transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence  negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  regulatory approvals  Nasdaq listing requirements  and other customary closing conditions.While subject to finalization in definitive agreements  the parties have discussed a preliminary  non-binding valuation framework for the legacy ProPhase business that may imply an enterprise value of up to approximately $30 million. Under the terms contemplated in the LOI  subject to applicable law  board approvals  and definitive documentation  ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of ProPhase Labs common stock as of a record date to be determined. Any such cash distribution would be separate from and not part of the merged operating company. Additionally  as described below  all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders.This framework represents the preliminary structure  subject to definitive documentation  for the transaction  expressly excludes certain cash distributions  asset carve-outs  and retained liabilities described below  and is subject to change based on due diligence  capitalization adjustments  financing activity  market conditions and final transaction terms. The parties currently anticipate working toward execution of definitive documentation within approximately 60 to 90 days.Strategic Rationale and Leadership Commentary“This LOI represents what we believe is one of the most important strategic developments in ProPhase Labs’ history ” said Ted Karkus  Chief Executive Officer of ProPhase Labs. “The proposed transaction structure is designed to deliver meaningful near-term value to our existing shareholders  while aligning ProPhase within the ABL Group  a global leader in molecular analysis  clinical research  and healthcare innovation that can accelerate the development and long-term potential of our genomics and diagnostic programs.”Transaction Structure and Operating FocusThe Proposed Transaction envisions that ABL shareholders would own approximately 76% of the combined company at closing. Following completion of the merger  a newly established U.S. subsidiary would hold and operate ProPhase’s Nebula Genomics platform  BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test program  and select consumer health businesses  enabling focused capital allocation and strategic execution.ABL would contribute its global infrastructure  including advanced data processing systems  cloud computing for health data  and financing capabilities. The ABL Group operates successful businesses:ABL Diagnostics (Euronext: ABLD  FR001400AHX6) delivers cutting-edge molecular testing solutions.CDL Pharma provides clinical trial logistics and sample management services.Humedics commercializes the LiMAx® liver function capacity test  a real-time breath test supporting liver surgery and transplantation.These companies would become sister entities to the new U.S. subsidiary  which is expected to remain under ProPhase’s current management team.“This proposed transaction represents a highly strategic opportunity for the ABL Group ” said Dr. Chalom B. Sayada  CEO of ABL. “By combining with a Nasdaq-listed U.S. platform  ABL will gain enhanced access to U.S. capital markets and accelerate commercialization of its portfolio in the United States. At the same time  ABL’s international distribution network and regulatory expertise will support global expansion of ProPhase’s BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test  Nebula Genomics  and consumer health businesses. This combination is intended to create meaningful  two-way strategic value and reinforces our commitment to innovation  global reach  and sustainable growth.”Significant Value Carve-Outs for Current ProPhase ShareholdersUnder the LOI  ProPhase Labs may declare a special cash dividend of up to $10 million payable to shareholders of record as of a date to be determined. This distribution would be separate from the merged operating company.Additionally  all Crown Medical Collections receivables are expected to be carved out for the exclusive benefit of current ProPhase shareholders  with anticipated collections of approximately $50 million net. These estimates are forward-looking and subject to significant uncertainty  including collection risk and timing variability.Together  these elements provide current ProPhase shareholders with a differentiated value pathway independent of the future performance of the combined company.Allocation of Assets and LiabilitiesThe combined operating company would assume only those liabilities expressly agreed in definitive documentation  currently contemplated to include approximately $5 million of ProPhase Labs’ existing indebtedness. All other legacy liabilities would remain with ProPhase Labs and would not be obligations of the post-merger entity.Transaction StatusThe proposed transaction remains subject to due diligence  negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  regulatory approvals  Nasdaq listing requirements  and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached or that the transaction will be consummated.CEO to Present to ShareholdersProPhase will present to shareholders today  December 19  2025 at 10:00 a.m. ET during the Virtual Non-Deal Roadshow Series hosted by Renmark Financial Communications Inc.REGISTER HERE:https://www.renmarkfinancial.com/live-registration/renmark-virtual-non-deal-roadshow-nasdaq-prph-GftGB-XDWXAbout Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A.Advanced Biological Laboratories S.A.
