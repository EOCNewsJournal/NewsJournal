Moreover  his team reportedly indicated that France  saddled with mounting debt  would be unlikely to issue guarantees in case the impounded assets had to be returned to Russia.The FT claimed that Macron joined Belgium  Italy  Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic in opposing the plan  thus “killing the idea.”EU leaders instead approved an interest-free €90 billion ($105 billion) loan to Ukraine backed by the bloc’s budget. Picking up the tab will be taxpayers in all EU member states except for Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic  which opted out.Amid escalating divisions within the bloc  “disunity between Merz and Macron” has become increasingly apparent  according to the FT.Speaking during an end-of-year Q&A session on Friday  Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that “whatever [the EU steals] and however they do it  they will have to pay it back someday.”Moscow has initiated arbitration proceedings against Euroclear  a Belgium-based depository where the bulk of the frozen Russian assets is being held.In November  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Western Europe had lost the right to have a say in the Ukraine crisis and had effectively “removed itself” from the negotiations due to its obstinate warmongering.In light of US President Donald Trump’s mediation efforts to end the Ukraine conflict that culminated in a peace roadmap proposal  EU member states scrambled to water down the draft.Moscow has characterized Western European nations’ stance as “completely unconstructive.”,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Macron', 'Merz', 'FT', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'year Q&A session', 'US President Donald Trump', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'anonymous senior EU diplomat', 'Western European nations’ stance', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'central bank funds', 'frozen Russian assets', 'reparations loan’ proposal', 'peace roadmap proposal', 'EU member states', 'European Commission', 'French leader', 'controversial proposal', 'impounded assets', 'EU leaders', 'German chancellor', 'Financial Times', 'mounting debt', 'Czech Republic', 'interest-free €90 billion', 'escalating divisions', 'arbitration proceedings', 'Belgium-based depository', 'obstinate warmongering', 'mediation efforts', 'Ukraine crisis', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Friedrich Merz', 'The FT', 'push', 'Kiev', 'military', 'economy', 'Sunday', 'price', 'publication', 'legality', 'question', 'team', 'France', 'guarantees', 'case', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'plan', 'idea', 'bloc', 'budget', 'tab', 'taxpayers', 'disunity', 'end', 'Friday', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'bulk', 'November', 'right', 'say', 'negotiations', 'light', 'draft']",2025-12-21,2025-12-22,rt.com

Last week  we decided that Russia would not get its assets back until Moscow ends its aggression. Today  we approved a decision to provide 90 billion euros to Ukraine for the next two years. As a matter of urgency  we will provide a loan backed by the European Union budget. This will address the urgent financial needs of Ukraine  and Ukraine will only repay this loan once Russia pays reparations. The union reserves its right to make use of the immobilized asset to repay this loan "" Costa told reporters.He added that European leaders also ""gave a mandate to the Commission to continue working on the reparation loan based on Russian immobilized assets.""Following the start of the Russian special military operation in 2022  the EU and G7 froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately $349 billion. Around $233 billion is held in European accounts  mainly at Belgium-based Euroclear. Russian President Vladimir Putin said confiscating immobilized Russian assets would amount to theft and undermine confidence in the eurozone.© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['European Council', 'EU Budget', 'Ukraine', '€90 Billion', 'European Council President Antonio Costa', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian special military operation', 'pressing financial needs', 'next two years', 'urgent financial needs', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Russian immobilized assets', 'The European Union', 'European Union budget', '90 billion euros loan', 'Russian assets', 'European leaders', 'European accounts', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'EU Budget', 'reparation loan', 'Sputnik News', '€90 Billion', 'Ukraine', 'MOSCOW', 'Friday', 'October', 'aggression', 'decision', 'matter', 'urgency', 'reparations', 'right', 'use', 'reporters', 'mandate', 'Commission', 'start', 'G7', 'half', 'theft', 'confidence', 'eurozone', '©']",2025-12-21,2025-12-22,globalsecurity.org
