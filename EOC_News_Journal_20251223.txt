54462,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/629894-eu-rob-taxpayers-steal-russian/,The EU is happy to mug its own taxpayers after failing to rob Russia,Every time Brussels tries to stick it to Putin  it’s somehow always the people who seem to get the shaft Read Full Article at RT.com,Every time Brussels tries to stick it to Putin  it’s somehow always the people who seem to get the shaftHold up  Eurobozos! And I mean that as a verb – as in to stop and freeze – not as the noun synonymous with the kind of literal bank robbery that they’ve been planning.Apparently  that needs to be clarified  lest they feel encouraged in continuing to weaponize the wide discretion afforded by their executive function  even as they express explicit deep doubts about their own people backing their actions.Such was the case on December 18 and 19 when heads of state of European Union countries met to discuss how they were going to magically pull another massive wad of cash that they don’t currently have for Ukraine from the rear compartments of their clown suits.French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni pointed out the obvious at their EU conclave  according to the Financial Times. Specifically  that convincing their own voters to send even more money to Ukraine might be tough. It probably doesn’t help that repayment odds look roughly the same as getting spare change back from a guy in a hoodie literally treating the entire world like one big panhandling corner.Then the European Central Bank chimed in  basically saying  “don’t look at us ” and made it clear they won’t be underwriting whatever scheme the EU ultimately came up with  Politico reported. “Monetary financing is not allowed under the treaty ” said ECB chief Christine Lagarde. “You cannot expect me to validate  ex ante  a mechanism under which there would be monetary financing. This is pretty obvious.”It’s not actually obvious to the Eurojokers  since they probably can’t see too well through their black ski masks.After 15 hours of arguing in a parked clown car  they ultimately decided that stealing Russian assets sitting in their own banks might cause them a legal headache – maybe because Russia had already kicked off legal action. So they decided instead to stick with one of their old go-to classics: robbing their own taxpayers. Every time they stick it to Putin  it’s Europeans who seem to get the shaft.“Today we approved a decision to provide €90 billion to Ukraine for the next two years. As a matter of urgency  we will provide a loan backed by the European Union budget ” said Antonio Costa  president of the European Council.Their big breakthrough was agreeing to hand Ukraine another €90 billion over two years by tapping what they’re calling “EU budget headroom ” according to their press statement. So the plan now is to go deeper into debt by borrowing more money on capital markets. Their budget has about as much “headroom” as a 6-and-a-half-foot guy trying to fold himself into a Fiat.These schemes always start with grand talk about making Russia pay  but then tend to end with EU taxpayers picking up the tab while being told that it’s a big win. But now comes the hard part: selling this self-owning move to the EU public.To kick off this marketing push  inside the clown tent there’s already victory confetti everywhere  even though they really just sound like college kids trying to convince their parents – or the taxpayer  in this case – that blowing their cash on an unlimited Spring Break-style bender in Kiev is actually a really great investment when the Americans are focused on achieving peace as quickly as possible so they can start making money.Remember their big plan from the past several weeks? The one where they were going to just take Russia’s money and use that? Funny how that vanished. No one has been running around saying  “What a historic triumph it would be to get ourselves another €90 billion deeper into debt.” No  their dream was finding a way to keep funding the military-industrial machine by forcing Russia to foot the bill. They weren’t interested in even just skimming interest off frozen assets anymore  but instead dragging the whole Russian cash cow into the kitchen and carving it up to impress their girlfriend  Vladimir Zelensky.That dream hit a wall when Belgium  home to Euroclear – the custodian of those assets – decided that it didn’t feel like volunteering to star in a future court case that risked etching it into the history books in the chapter on “world’s stupidest financial criminals.”Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic have also just said that they’re opting out entirely of the opportunity to carve deeper into their own national debt for all this – which risks making it awkward for EU leaders who didn’t sit it out when the voters of all these countries start comparing notes.Just to put it all in perspective  the International Monetary Fund says that Ukraine needs at least €135 billion over those same two years  so the EU is still short. Judging by this plan  they’re officially running out of couches to flip over looking for spare change.But for now  they’re calling it a win. Yet another carefully choreographed celebration of failure  financed by the same taxpayers who never get invited to the party. They’re just expected to show up after the rager to pay for the cleanup.,neutral,0.14,0.73,0.13,mixed,0.13,0.1,0.77,True,English,"['The EU', 'taxpayers', 'Russia', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'ECB chief Christine Lagarde', 'unlimited Spring Break-style bender', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'one big panhandling corner', 'literal bank robbery', 'explicit deep doubts', 'black ski masks', 'past several weeks', 'European Central Bank', 'stupidest financial criminals', 'International Monetary Fund', 'next two years', 'same two years', 'European Union countries', 'European Union budget', 'future court case', 'Russian cash cow', 'European Council', 'Financial Times', 'big breakthrough', 'big win', 'Monetary financing', 'Russian assets', 'same taxpayers', 'wide discretion', 'executive function', 'massive wad', 'rear compartments', 'clown suits', 'repayment odds', 'clown car', 'legal headache', 'legal action', 'Antonio Costa', 'press statement', 'capital markets', 'grand talk', 'hard part', 'self-owning move', 'marketing push', 'clown tent', 'victory confetti', 'college kids', 'great investment', 'historic triumph', 'military-industrial machine', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'history books', 'Czech Republic', 'big plan', 'EU conclave', 'EU public', 'frozen assets', 'EU leaders', 'entire world', 'half-foot guy', 'spare change', 'EU taxpayers', 'national debt', 'Brussels', 'Putin', 'people', 'shaft', 'Eurobozos', 'verb', 'noun', 'kind', 'actions', 'December', 'heads', 'Ukraine', 'voters', 'money', 'hoodie', 'scheme', 'Politico', 'treaty', 'mechanism', 'Eurojokers', '15 hours', 'banks', 'old', 'classics', 'Europeans', 'decision', 'matter', 'urgency', 'loan', 'headroom', 'Fiat', 'tab', 'parents', 'Kiev', 'Americans', 'peace', 'dream', 'way', 'bill', 'interest', 'kitchen', 'girlfriend', 'wall', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'custodian', 'chapter', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'opportunity', 'notes', 'perspective', 'couches', 'celebration', 'failure', 'party', 'rager', 'cleanup', '6']",2025-12-22,2025-12-23,rt.com

We need money here  in Slovakia  we have things to build "" Fico said during the ceremonial opening of Slovakia's longest road tunnel  Visnove  the construction of which took nearly 30 years. The ceremony was broadcast by Slovak television channel TA3. The Visnove tunnel  located in northern Slovakia  is 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) long. The project began almost 30 years ago  but approaches to construction and financing repeatedly changed  and the protracted project was only completed this year. The tunnel is a crucial part of a transport corridor connecting the capital Bratislava (in the west) with the country's second-largest city  Kosice (in the east). Prime Minister Fico ceremonially opened the republic's longest road tunnel by rollerblading through it. The European Commission sought EU member states' consent to the use of Russian sovereign assets for Kiev. A sum of between 185 billion euros and 210 billion euros ($217-$247 billion) in the form of a loan was discussed  which Ukraine would conditionally be required to repay after the end of the conflict and in the event of ""Moscow paying it for material damages."" Meanwhile  the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the EU's idea of ​​Russia paying reparations to Ukraine was unrealistic  and that Brussels had long been engaged in the theft of Russian assets. In the early hours on December 19  the EU Council summit concluded  resulting in the EU temporarily abandoning its plans to seize Russian assets and deciding to provide Ukraine with a 90 billion euro loan from its own budget. Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic will not be participating in securing the loan.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251222/euroclear-says-welcomes-european-councils-decision-not-to-use-russian-assets-for-ukraine-1123344500.htmlslovakiaukrainebratislavaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationaleuropean union to finance ukraine  insane eu plans to finance ukraine  slovakia will not participate  prime minister of slovakia robert fico",negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,mixed,0.06,0.18,0.76,True,English,"['Insane EU Plans', 'Prime Minister', 'Slovakia', 'Ukraine', 'robert fico bratislava european union', ""EU member states' consent"", 'Slovak television channel', 'The European Commission', 'longest road tunnel', 'Russian Foreign Ministry', 'Slovakia Robert Fico', 'EU Council summit', 'european council assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'The Visnove tunnel', 'Prime Minister Fico', '90 billion euro loan', 'Insane EU Plans', 'slovakia ukraine bratislava', 'world slovakia ukraine', 'capital Bratislava', 'Russian assets', 'assets assets', 'insane plans', '185 billion euros', '210 billion euros', 'Sputnik International', 'military loans', 'ceremonial opening', 'transport corridor', 'largest city', 'material damages', 'early hours', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'northern Slovakia', 'crucial part', 'Czech Republic', 'sputnikglobe', 'finance', 'prime-minister', 'country', 'priorities', 'money', 'Monday', 'cdn', 'things', 'construction', '30 years', 'ceremony', 'TA3.', 'project', 'approaches', 'financing', 'protracted', 'west', 'second', 'Kosice', 'east', 'use', 'Kiev', 'form', 'end', 'conflict', 'event', 'idea', '\u200b\u200bRussia', 'reparations', 'Brussels', 'theft', 'December', 'budget', 'Hungary', 'euroclear', 'says', 'european-councils-decision', 'russian-assets', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2025-12-22,2025-12-23,sputnikglobe.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

The business generated c.€749 million current annual sales in 2024 with nearly 14 000 employees. This divestment marks the completion of Nexans’ strategic transformation into a pure electrification player.Julien Hueber  Chief Executive Officer of Nexans  commented: “Since 2023  Nexans has successfully divested its non-electrification activities  including Aginode  AmerCable and Lynxeo to focus fully on its ‘Sparking Electrification’ strategy. As the last remaining non-electrification business in our portfolio  the time has come for Autoelectric to continue its development under a new owner that is deeply anchored in the automotive industry. Motherson represents a natural strategic fit and provides the right environment for the business to continue growing. With this transaction  Nexans fully deploys its model of value creation of pure player in electrification  serving clients at the heart of the global energy transition and enabling the development of low-carbon  sustainable power systems that meet the world’s accelerating demand for electrification.”Mr Vivek Chaand Sehgal  Chairman of Motherson Group  said: “This acquisition is a significant milestone for Motherson. It will enable us to support our key customers with wiring harness solutions and expand our global footprint to additional locations. We believe that our executional capabilities combined with AutoElectric’s strong engineering capabilities and customer relationships  will drive innovation and sustainable growth. We look forward to welcoming all new members of AutoElectric into the Motherson family.”The relevant works council will be informed and consulted in connection with the proposed transaction  which would be structured as a series of sales of shares and assets to acquire the harness business of Autoelectric. In addition  the proposed transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of customary regulatory approvals. On this basis  completion of the proposed transaction could take place mid-2026. The terms of the transaction are not disclosed. Evercore is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Linklaters as legal counsel to Nexans in connection with this transaction.IFRS 5 - Accounting treatment and resulting implications for 2025 outlookIn accordance with IFRS 5  the proposed transaction will trigger the classification of Autoelectric  as Assets Held for Sale in the 2025 consolidated financial statements.As a result  the Industry and Solutions Businesses (consisting of Amercable  Lynxeo and Autoelectric) will be classified as discontinued operations1 in the 2025 consolidated financial statements. Such classification will be reflected on both the year 2025 and the comparative year 2024  in order to ensure the consistency of presentation between reported periods.The 2025 guidance  as updated on July 30th 2025  forecasted Autoelectric as a consolidated segment for 2025  while Lynxeo was consolidated for the first half of 2025  until the day of completion of the disposal on June 30th 2025.As a consequence  the 2025 guidance is today being aligned with the new scope of continuing operations  the new scope which now excludes the discontinued operations1.Under this new scope  the 2025 guidance  as updated on 30th July 2025  remains otherwise unchanged:Adjusted EBITDA Low range (M€) High range (M€) 2025 Guidance (presented in July 2025)(included 12 months of Autoelectric and 6 months of Lynxeo) 810 860 Exclusion of discontinued operations(12 months of Autoelectric and 6 months of Lynxeo) 100 100 2025 Guidance aligned with new scope 710 760FCF Low range (M€) High range (M€) 2025 Guidance (presented in July 2025)(included 12 months of Autoelectric and 6 months of Lynxeo) 275 375 Exclusion of discontinued operations(12 months of Autoelectric and 6 months of Lynxeo) - - 2025 Guidance aligned with new scope 275 375The remaining details of the proposed transaction will be outlined in the Nexans 2025 consolidated financial statements.Nexans confirms its 2028 guidance which remains unchanged.About NexansNexans is the global pure player in sustainable electrification  building the essential systems that power the world’s transition to a connected  resilient  and low-carbon future.

We have strongly positioned ourselves for the next few years to deliver on our THEON NEXT Vision & Strategy unveiled during our Capital Markets Day.

None of our achievements would be possible without them and all our stakeholders  so I would like to thank everyone for their continued commitment and support.”Strategic ProgressTHEON has made strong progress during 2025  delivering on strategic priorities while continuing to expand order backlog  strengthen supply chain security and invest in future  reflecting the Group’s focus on the long-term sustainable growth.During the year  the Group launched its THEON NEXT initiative  a platform designed to drive the development of next generation soldier systems through targeted investments  collaborations  and co-development projects. Several of these investments and strategic partnerships across the United States and Europe have already been announced  including with Kopin  eMagin  Varjo and Alereon  supporting the development of next-generation digital and augmented-reality capabilities.Theon also agreed to acquire 100% of Kappa Optronics as well as a 30% minority stake in ShockEOS (with an option to reach a majority position)  expanding its product portfolio and engineering capabilities in electro-optics for platforms.In October 2025  the Group announced the agreement to acquire a 9.8% equity stake in Exosens. This investment is intended to enhance long-term supply security for IIT and further solidify the two companies’ strategic partnership. This increased collaboration between THEON and Exosens was further evidenced in the December 2025 extension of the long-term commercial supply agreement through to 2030  with increased volume commitments and greater visibility over future production requirements. The transaction is expected to be finalized in January 2026  subject to customary regulatory notifications.Financing and Capital AllocationIn October 2025  THEON announced the signing of a new €300 m senior facility agreement with a syndicate of 9 leading international and Greek banks. The proceeds were used to refinance short-term debt and support general corporate activity and larger acquisitions.In addition to the new facility  THEON raised approximately €150 m in December 2025 through a Right Issue. The offering was heavily supported by THEON’s majority shareholders  Venetus Limited and CHRE Investments Limited  subscribing approximately €107 m of the raise. In total  8 624 645 new shares were issued  bringing the current total number of ordinary shares to c.78.6 m.The Group remains focused on maintaining profitability levels  managing leverage and allocating capital selectively in support of its strategic objectives. As part of this focus  THEON adjusted guidance of dividend distribution to 20-30% of net income for FY 2026  reducing pay out rate but expected to increase dividend pay-out in absolute terms.Financial and Commercial Performance & OutlookAt the most recent Trading Update  THEON upgraded its FY 2025 revenue guidance to €435-445 m  which would result in the strongest top line performance in the Company’s history. The Company remains confident that it will achieve this guidance.THEON has seen a consistent flow of orders over 2025. The highlight of which is the December 2025 contract revision between OCCAR and THEON/ Hensoldt consortium for 100 000 Night Vision Goggles (NVG)  bringing the total backlog (including options) to c. €2.4 bn  more than 2x December 2024. The contract revision represents the largest single procurement of NVGs in the history of a European NATO member  indicating that THEON is delivering on its strategy and is recognised by trusted partners.Contracts are shifting from short-term to more longer-term agreements  as evidenced by the multi-year framework agreement with a European NATO member state for NVGs and IRIS-C Thermal Clip-ons. THEON’s recent investments and long-term commercial agreements for IIT place the Company in a unique market position to serve clients uninterruptedly through consistently high demand.Demand for night vision and thermal imaging solutions continues to be supported by defense modernisation across NATO and allied countries. Supply constraints remain evident across certain key components  reinforcing the importance of long-term supply arrangements and strategic partnerships.GuidanceFollowing completion of the successful Rights Issue  THEON is able to reinstate and introduce Adj. EBIT Margin guidance for FY 2025 and FY 2026  respectively. All other guidance remains unchanged.FY 2025 FY 2026 Mid-Term Targets Revenue €435 - 445 m €570-600 m Organic Growth >15% per annum Adj.

Despite only being listed for just under two years  we have built a reputation for delivering and overdelivering and have continued our ambitious growth trajectory. We have strongly positioned ourselves for the next few years to deliver on our THEON NEXT Vision & Strategy unveiled during our Capital Markets Day. We are decisive and disruptive  and focused on building a globally leading group delivering next generation soldier systems.In a high growth market  securing your supply chain is fundamental to remaining a market-leading player  and we have done just that. Our sequence of investments  acquisitions and partnerships and highly strategic stake in Exosens will support us in remaining at the forefront of the market and in a position to respond to global demand trends.With the Company on track to deliver record revenue and profit in FY 2025 and plentiful market dynamics  we are entering 2026 with strong momentum  and we don’t expect to show signs of slowing down any time soon.I am extremely proud of the work the team has done  not just this year but over the past 28 years of THEON’s history  placing THEON in the position it is today. None of our achievements would be possible without them and all our stakeholders  so I would like to thank everyone for their continued commitment and support.”Strategic ProgressTHEON has made strong progress during 2025  delivering on strategic priorities while continuing to expand order backlog  strengthen supply chain security and invest in future  reflecting the Group’s focus on the long-term sustainable growth.During the year  the Group launched its THEON NEXT initiative  a platform designed to drive the development of next generation soldier systems through targeted investments  collaborations  and co-development projects. Several of these investments and strategic partnerships across the United States and Europe have already been announced  including with Kopin  eMagin  Varjo and Alereon  supporting the development of next-generation digital and augmented-reality capabilities.Theon also agreed to acquire 100% of Kappa Optronics as well as a 30% minority stake in ShockEOS (with an option to reach a majority position)  expanding its product portfolio and engineering capabilities in electro-optics for platforms.In October 2025  the Group announced the agreement to acquire a 9.8% equity stake in Exosens. This investment is intended to enhance long-term supply security for IIT and further solidify the two companies’ strategic partnership. This increased collaboration between THEON and Exosens was further evidenced in the December 2025 extension of the long-term commercial supply agreement through to 2030  with increased volume commitments and greater visibility over future production requirements. The transaction is expected to be finalized in January 2026  subject to customary regulatory notifications.Financing and Capital AllocationIn October 2025  THEON announced the signing of a new €300 m senior facility agreement with a syndicate of 9 leading international and Greek banks. The proceeds were used to refinance short-term debt and support general corporate activity and larger acquisitions.In addition to the new facility  THEON raised approximately €150 m in December 2025 through a Right Issue. The offering was heavily supported by THEON’s majority shareholders  Venetus Limited and CHRE Investments Limited  subscribing approximately €107 m of the raise. In total  8 624 645 new shares were issued  bringing the current total number of ordinary shares to c.78.6 m.The Group remains focused on maintaining profitability levels  managing leverage and allocating capital selectively in support of its strategic objectives. As part of this focus  THEON adjusted guidance of dividend distribution to 20-30% of net income for FY 2026  reducing pay out rate but expected to increase dividend pay-out in absolute terms.Financial and Commercial Performance & OutlookAt the most recent Trading Update  THEON upgraded its FY 2025 revenue guidance to €435-445 m  which would result in the strongest top line performance in the Company’s history. The Company remains confident that it will achieve this guidance.THEON has seen a consistent flow of orders over 2025.

However as long as they stick to the attitude they have so far and open the roads to facilitate Christmas travellers things will be better. With some inconvenience… holiday travel for both Christmas and New Year will be done and then everyone will go to work  as is done every year with the farmers in January. However  with a careful eye one will see that the government gave the farmers 70% of what they asked for and the farmers 90%  my source in Maximou told me.The rumours of elections and K.M.-On the occasion of the farmers’ case and since we are now entering a “long march” to elections from 2026  I hear more and more often several political actors (and not) arguing that “Mitsotakis should not go all the way  he has nothing to gain  everyone will ask for something and something will always pop up  so let’s go to elections in the spring and get it over with as long as it is in these numbers poll-wise that we see today”. I don’t know if I agree with the assessment or not  what I do know is that K.M. is just… not that kind of guy  that’s not the only way he thinks  so I don’t see it as likely  as it seems to me unlikely  that he would “tinker” with the election law. Now of course you will say that in politics unexpected things happen that lead to developments  but this is true over time  but I repeat – under normal circumstances – I don’t see early elections.The 2026 targets-Mitsotakis  however  is investing in deliverables  which is why Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting will focus on the ministries’ central priorities for 2026. Schematically  there are 20 reforms and 20 projects that the government is basically required to complete in the next year. I hear that detailed details will be made public in the New Year  possibly at a press conference to be held by Hatzidakis and Skertos  who have also done the basic preparation for the ministers’ dossiers.Gathering at the Megaron-On Saturday  a joint political initiative by Kostas Tasoulas and Kyriakos Mitsotakis to support … classical music was unannounced! The President and the Prime Minister stood side by side in the VIP box at the Megaron to attend the concert with works by Brahms and Dvořák by the Greek Youth Symphony Orchestra (ELSON) under the direction of conductor Dionysis Grammenos and with Leonidas Kavakos on violin and Timotheos Gavrielides-Petrin on cello as soloists. Joining them in the same box were the President’s wife Fani Stathopoulou  the Prime Minister’s wife Mareva Grabovski  Nikos Dendias  Lina Mendoni and the US Ambassador to Athens Kimberly Guilfoyle accompanied by her son Ronan Anthony. Other well-known guests  such as Alexis Patelis and the shipowner Panos Laskaridis  joined the celebratory drink during the break. Mitsotakis was so impressed by the orchestra and the talent and dynamism of the young children that he asked Mendoni to have the Ministry of Culture support the orchestra on a regular basis  which the minister did immediately  announcing at the end of the concert that the conductor would receive an annual sponsorship of 150 000 euros. We recall that the Parliament  initially with Mr. Tasoulas as its President  and now with Nikitas Kaklamanis as its President  has supported the ELSON.Dendias -Kairidis-That Dendias in recent months has been attempting a “differentiation within”  in the context of the next day  is  I think  obvious  although I personally doubt that it is politically visible at the moment. Anyway  everything is evidence of it  moving from the Unknown Soldier monument case to his public appearances at events of unfriendly media (Democracy  EFSYN). Anyway  everything has its little or big semantics  although I personally don’t consider such events important  since the media should host all voices and politicians should express their views everywhere as well. But I learned that regarding the episode of Deputy Minister of Defence Davakis with Kairidis – the latter spat on Dendia’s absence from the committee responsible for the Ministry of Defence bill – in the M.M. they were not happy at all and of course they were completely unconcerned. I am told that even K.M. himself  though he was not thrilled with the idea of Dendias’ absence from the competent committee – even though the minister was between Lorian and Athens due to Belharra – did not like Kairidis’ move in the logic of “the in-house not in the house”. Well  he didn’t whip him!The Pierrakakis arrangement for the Swiss and the 600 million bill.-The Swiss franc loans  a case that tormented some 70 000 borrowers and their families  came to an end with the Pierrakakis regulation that passed the Parliament. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro from 2010 to 2025 is around 45% and this highlights the scale of the problem that was created. The Pierrakakis regulation concerns all borrowers without exception  who are offered for the first time a favourable opportunity to get out of the deadlock  as the haircut is scaled according to asset criteria and reaches up to 50%. Another important aspect of the arrangement is that it does not affect Hercules’ guarantees  thereby placing a burden on the State. On the contrary  the banks estimate the loss from the regulation at 600 million  a not insignificant amount.On energy deals at the Ministry of Energy  Kimberly-Christmas visits with energy content will be made today at the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Specifically  in the Mesogeion building  Stavros Papastavrou will receive this morning the US Ambassador to Greece  Kimberly Guilfoyle  who adds yet another ministry to her list of visits. 2025 could not have ended any other way for one of the faces of the year – it’s true – as energy deals were at the core of her mission and at the forefront of government priorities.First quarter draws for Euroxx-We now turn to the market  starting with the Piraeus Group’s moves. Well  in terms of Euroxx and its integration into the Piraeus Bank Group  things are progressing and progressing well. The deal  which will take some time to close  is estimated to be reached in the first quarter of the year. This is not a simple undertaking  as in this case  the aim is for the entity that will be created to integrate all investment banking services. “It follows in the footsteps of Alpha Bank with AXIA Ventures. The agreement with Euroxx is dictated by the complexity of the developments created by the acquisition of the Greek Stock Exchange by Euronext  which requires large schemes.30 December signatures for Egnatia Odos with GEK TERNA (75%) – EGIS (25%)-The management of the Yperta Fund is counting the days until next Tuesday  December 30  when the “financial closing” of the 35-year concession contract of Egnatia Odos to the consortium GEK TERNA (75%) – EGIS Projects (25%) will be signed. The Yperta Fund will immediately receive EUR 1.3 billion. Immediately after the holidays  the management of the Yperta Fund will present to the Prime Minister the study completed for the 22 airports  so that the tender procedures can start in early February. Regarding the ports  after the Prime Minister meets with the Minister of State for Transport and Communications. After the meeting with the Minister of Shipping and the Super Fund Management  he was instructed to prepare the sub-concession tender for Elefsina  as well as the maturation for the implementation of the business plan for the Port of Alexandroupolis. The one-dimensional model of majority privatisation has been abandoned  and a more flexible approach is being adopted  with a single management system  targeted public-private partnerships (PPPs)  and concessions of specific activities  instead of a full management assignment.The… old lines at National Insurance-With 40 plus – probably approaching 50 years of career experience each – two executives who are the living history of the insurance market in our country have joined the board of National Insurance. These are George Kotsalos  who assumes the position of non-executive chairman of the company’s Board of Directors  while Triantafyllos Lyssimachou is expected to participate in the Board of National Insurance from the side of Piraeus Bank. The latter is the one who “combines” the experiences of both entities. G. Kotsalos  among others  was CEO of the INTERAMERICAN Group for many years  where he played a central role in its operation and strategy. A former Chairman of the Hellenic Association of Insurance Companies  with more than one term of office  he is familiar with the issues of the insurance market  which  although they have changed  retain the same core. Triantafyllos Lyssimachou had served for several years as General Manager of Insurance Operations at Piraeus Bank Group  while he had served for 15 years previously at National Insurance  including as Senior Director of Information Technology and Commercial Director of the company.As a Senior Vice President and Head of the Corporate Finance Department  he was also a Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Finance at the Bank.The Christmas fight…-Tomorrow – on the eve of Christmas – early in the morning  at the Athens Single-Member Court of First Instance  the injunction filed by the main shareholder Chrysa-Lemonia Koutla (16.08%) against the Board of Directors of the listed construction company PROODEVITIKI S.A.  founded by her father and managed by her brother until his death  will be heard. This is a stunning case that reveals all the pathologies of corporate governance in our market. In September 2022  the Board of Directors of Progressive signed an agreement with an offshore company  LDA Capital Limited  which would fund Progressive with up to €20 million over 3 years. The shareholders approved the contract. Years have passed  and Progressive has not received a single euro. Why? The Board never submitted a request for financing! Suddenly  despite the lack of cash flow from the contract  the Board decides to give a fee (!) of 400 000 euros to the “investor” along with some warrants. The shareholders were never fully informed about the fee. The “investor” will receive €400 000 + 1 216 000 shares from the warrants. Today  Progressive “owes” LDA Capital €221 000  with the contract providing for the execution of a pledge on the shares of Vice President Anargyros Tsadimas. However  instead of executing the pledge  the Board of Directors  on October 17  2025  decided to increase the share capital by 222 399.90 euros with capitalization of liabilities and exclusion of the pre-emptive right of the existing shareholders. In simpler words  it shifts the obligation to the shareholders. Koutla argues that the AGM never gave such an authorisation. But there is a corollary. On July 12  2024  the Board unilaterally extended the contract for one year by reducing the price of the warrants without AGM approval. Koutla reasonably asks: how will the company collect in one year what it did not collect in three  especially after exiting conservatorship in April 2025?…and the Progressive mess-LDA Capital Limited declares itself a “global alternative investment group. It specialises in private placements in companies with “high risk” profiles  from blockchain and cryptocurrencies to cannabis and indebted small listed companies. The operating model is interesting. It provides “capital commitments” that are executed in stages  with the company initiating the request but the investor retaining veto power over approval. The question is  why did PROODETIKI insist on this contract when its bank debts were paid off by arrangement  using almost €4 million of liquidity left by the previous management of Koutla’s brother Konstantinos? The contract allows LDA to acquire up to 20% of Progressive. The main shareholder  who alleges a number of illegalities and omissions  has appealed to the supervisory authorities and is asking the judiciary to annul the Board’s decisions before the AMC is completed. The Board was obliged to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders on 5 January 2026  only at Koutla’s request. The agenda includes a legality check  an update on the obligations to the LDA  and an update on the authorizations. Tomorrow  the Court will decide whether the proceedings should be temporarily halted. The question is  how does a Board sign a financing agreement  fail to execute it for 3 years  owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees  and ultimately choose to pass the cost on to shareholders through a “dilutive capital increase”Stegos is building in the southern suburbs and partnering with Tr. Piraeus.-The Steggos group of Techniki Olympiakios seems to have found a brilliant field of glory in real estate  with a big “opening” in the residential sector  especially in higher-end houses. In fact  one of the ongoing new  large projects of the group is the one in Pigadakia of Voula for the residential complex that will be completed  in good faith  in 2027  having even proceeded for this purpose last October in the issuance of a common implicitly secured bond loan with a total nominal value of up to 25 million euros  five-year term. Indicatively  the houses in this project  in an area of 7 328 sq.m.  on Fleming and Karkavitssa streets in Voula  will be sold at around 13 000 euros per sq.m. Now  at the end of 2025  the latest move by Stegos is the establishment of Vesta Asset Partners S.A.  a company active in the development of real estate for residential use. The interesting element in this case  apart from the large share capital of 7.37 million euros that the new company has  is the shareholding structure where the Steggou Group  through its subsidiary Premier Capital Investments  owns 80% and the remaining 20% belongs to Piraeus Bank. The participation in the company’s board of directors is similar  where George Steggos is the chairman  while Nikolaos Vezyrakis  from the Strategy and Data Analysis department in the real estate sector of Tr. Piraeus. At the same time  last week the company announced that it is moving forward with the other project of consideration (a related process had “run” in 2023) for a church property in Vouliagmeni with the signing of the relevant contract. This is the property of 1 342 sq.m. at 6 Alekos Panagouli Street for the construction of 4 residences  while the share of consideration is 43%.The Rear Admiral and the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek merchant marine– “Greek shipping does not just follow the developments in the country’s defence  but actively participates in their formation. Not with statements  but with deeds. This phrase is heard more and more often in the corridors of the Pentagon and could hardly fail to refer first to Panos Laskaridis. Rear Admiral of the Navy with honor  contractor of the frigate “KIMON” and President of the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation  he has established himself as a benchmark of a new  practical benevolence to the Armed Forces. The donations of the Laskaridis brothers’ family are neither fragmentary nor communicative. From the state-of-the-art V-BAT drones to the ASDEN and the diving watches to the DYK  to the “KYKNOS” programme of more than 23 million euros for the upgrade of “S” type frigates and the Fleet General Support Ships  the footprint is measurable and operationally critical. The construction of a new Squadron at the Icons School in Dhekelia  in collaboration with the GAF  is in the same vein  meeting a real need of tomorrow’s Air Force officers. In this context  the recent proclamation of Ioanna Athina Martinou as an honorary Commander of the Navy  on the occasion of the donation of a navigation simulator to the Naval Cadet School  came to be “snapped”. Movements with a common philosophy: support with substance  not with words. And in the background  a clear message that modern national defence is now also being built by those who know what the sea  responsibility  and durability mean.From knitting to investing-Hellas Cotton S.A.  owned by the Theodorides family  founded in 1996 and based in Thessaloniki  is one of the largest companies in the knitted fabric sector and one could say that it is one of the few in the industry that… survived after successive crises. Its current shareholders want to expand into other ‘fields’ of the market. Thus  they proceeded to set up a Holging company called Artexa Holding & Investments S.A.  which aims to establish companies or participate in existing ones  as well as to engage in investment activity through all forms of investment. The initial share capital is set at EUR 24 600 000  of which EUR 24 584 671 03 is a contribution in kind and EUR 15 328 97 in cash. The ‘in kind’ is none other than shares in both Hellas Cotton and Mercury Corporation-Export Clothing Manufacturing. The total value of their shares was estimated at EUR 24 584 671 03 (EUR 4 183 307 50 for Hellas Cotton and EUR 20 401 363 53 for Mercury Corporation). The three shareholders  namely Dimitris Theodorides  Elias Theodorides  and Nikolaos Petronikolos  each hold 37 5 % of the new company  the first two  who have also assumed the positions of Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors  and 25% by the third.Peter G’s return to the New York Stock Exchange-The … subtext behind Peter G’s move is simple: shipping is returning to the US capital markets not as it was  but as it needs to be. If the venture succeeds  it will not just open up a deal  but a path that in recent years has seemed closed. If it fails  it will confirm that Wall Street remains selective about shipping. Peter Georgiopoulos’ return to New York via Spac is neither accidental nor nostalgic. From Wall Street’s perspective  it is a cold reading of the timing and tools available. The traditional IPO market remains closed to shipping  not out of ideology  but out of investor fatigue. Spac  by contrast  offers flexibility and timing – two elements that matter more than the narrative. GPAC’s $230 million is not a huge amount by market standards  but it is sufficient for targeted moves into assets in transition. The issue’s oversubscription shows that Georgiopoulos’ name is still “on the books” for institutional investors  mainly because it comes with a track record of execution rather than promises. The presence of Leo Vrondissis and a proven financial staff reassures the market that this is not an experiment. At the same time  opening up to data centres  maritime tech and digital infrastructure is not a fashion; it is an adaptation. Wall Street is no longer just asking for ships; it’s asking for cash flow predictability and a technology upgrade narrative. To give you an idea for those who don’t… SPAC is a shell company that goes public without having a business. Its purpose is to raise capital from investors and  within a specified period of time (usually 18-24 months)  merge with or acquire a private company.Greek stock market nears 16-year high-Near this year’s highs are back with Athens Avenue  with five more “bends” left to be completed by 2025. The General Index closed Friday at 2 112.46 points and was at its highest point since August 25  when it closed at 2 116.10 points. This is immediately followed by a year high of 2 126.18 points  and should there be another breakout  the stock market will claim the levels it has not seen in 16 years  namely since March 2010. In this effort  the market has several allies  as apart from the banks  there are a dozen stocks that are trading at record levels. Among them are PPC  GEK TERNA  Titan  Motor Oil  Viohalco  Aktor  Cenergy  Athens International Airport  ElvalHalcor  EYDAP  as well as mid-cap papers such as ABAX  Kri Kri  Profile  Trade Estates  and newcomer Qualco. And if 2025 is characterized as successful based on strong returns  2026 is considered special overall for the Greek stock market ecosystem. First  it will complete its acquisition by Euronext through a squeeze-out for the shares it does not currently own  fully integrating HA into the pan-European group’s team. In addition  an upgrade from the FTSE Russell to developed markets will come into effect in September  signalling similar moves by other index providers  most notably MSCI.The end of the crypto euphoria-In the coming days  many analyses and reports will be published on the most profitable investments of the outgoing year. One thing is certain: 2025 was a year of surprises and upheavals in the commodities market (Commodities). Investors showed a clear preference for tangible assets with industrial utility  significantly reducing positions in promising digital speculative bets. Silver emerges as the champion with a +130% return this year  more than double that of gold (+65%). Traditional commodities dominate: copper (+35%) benefits from infrastructure development and electrification. Traditional stock market indices  Nasdaq (+20%)  S&P 500 (+16%)  Russell 2000 (+13%) continued to offer good returns. Cryptocurrencies disappointed their fanatical fans. Bitcoin (-6%) and Ethereum (-12%) are losing ground  but altcoins (-42%) are experiencing a full-blown massacre. The wild party is over  regulatory oversight is tightening globally  and the “digital gold” narrative is becoming less believable in the face of the explosive rise of real precious metals. Institutional investors have sold their profits to ambitious retail investors and turned to safer assets. This time around  we are witnessing an apocalyptic shift in physical values. “Tangible assets  industrial demand  real value.Trump’s holidays and Wall Street’s expectations-For the first time in many years  the US President “gave” a full week’s vacation to public employees for Christmas. Christmas Eve (12/24) will be a holiday for all federal employees  as will the day after Christmas – Friday (12/26). Along with December 25  an unprecedented five-day holiday is created to give the US State a rest from the two-month shutdown. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were quick to announce that they would not follow suit and would remain open. The holidays apply only to federal employees  not the private sector. Trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and NYSE will close early  at 1 p.m. on Wednesday. The markets will be closed on Thursday in observance of Christmas. Friday  back to work. The reason for this choice is clear: Dec. 24 marks the start of the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally. Wall Street tradition wants stocks to rally on the last five days of the year and the first two sessions of the New Year. In theory  starting Wednesday  Wall Street enters its best two-week period of the year. The truth is that  with all we’ve lived through  traditions and customs are neither fully observed nor believed…The over-indebted Pentagon and the most powerful army on the planet-For the 8th consecutive year  the US Pentagon has failed its annual financial audit. Assets of $4.65 trillion against liabilities of $4.73 trillion  but without the ability to certify their accuracy. The world’s largest defence organisation cannot present auditable financial figures and certainly cannot be held accountable to Congress for the US defence budget  which exceeds USD 850 billion a year. A negative net position of $80 billion would cause panic in any other agency or public body. At the Pentagon  however  the situation is considered “improved” because the percentage of accounts that cannot be verified has been reduced. Congress continues to “approve” increasing defense budgets without basic transparency. The confrontation with China and Russia creates a political cover for unaccountable spending. The inability of the US Pentagon to control its finances underlines the need for enhanced European defence autonomy  not only militarily  but also in the management of defence resources. Increased defence spending must be accompanied by strict control mechanisms.
