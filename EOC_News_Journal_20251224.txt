The US Justice Department  and other federal agencies routinely endorse and condone what the White House does  according to the pundit. Hence  it's hardly surprising that Washington gets away with the seizure of Venezuelan oil – ""there are legions of attorneys who will create opinions justifying the goals and objectives of the government."" What's worse  this approach is increasingly trending elsewhere  according to the expert. Indeed  the EU leadership has repeatedly tried to find a loophole in the bloc’s regulations to seize frozen Russian sovereign assets  most of which are held by Belgium’s Euroclear. Facing strong resistance from Belgium  EU leaders have dropped the plan - for now. In March  Germany seized Eventin  an oil tanker flying a Panamanian flag  that originally departed from the Russian port of Ust-Luga  and sought to confiscate nearly 100 000 tons of oil. However  on December 11  Germany's top fiscal court ruled that the German authorities cannot sell or otherwise use the tanker and its cargo.https://sputnikglobe.com/20251223/eus-plans-to-seize-russian-assets-undermines-blocs-authority--venezuelan-lawmaker-1123348916.htmlvenezuelabelgiumgermanySputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602025Ekaterina BlinovaEkaterina BlinovaNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Ekaterina Blinovadonald trump  us seized tankers with oil from venezuela  venezuelan oil confiscation  attempts to steal russian frozen assets  eu  euroclear  us strikes in the caribbean  international law",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['Venezuelan Oil Mirrors', 'US Seizure', 'Global Trend', 'Grabbing', 'Fashion', 'The US Justice Department', 'justice department opinion', 'American political scientist', 'other federal agencies', 'top fiscal court', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'russian frozen assets', 'Ekaterina Blinova News', 'President Donald Trump', 'germany european union', 'Venezuelan Oil Mirrors', 'venezuelan oil confiscation', 'Global Trend Grabbing', 'Russian port', 'white house', 'Trump-Vance administration', 'international law', 'John Kavulich', 'international politics', 'strong resistance', 'Panamanian flag', 'German authorities', 'Rossiya Segodnya', 'Sputnik International', 'US Seizure', 'EU leadership', 'oil tanker', 'sputnikglobe', 'fashion', 'global-trend', 'precedent', 'analysis', 'belgium', 'cdn1.', 'governments', 'decisions', 'confines', 'expert', 'pundit', 'Washington', 'legions', 'attorneys', 'opinions', 'goals', 'objectives', 'approach', 'loophole', 'bloc', 'regulations', 'Euroclear', 'plan', 'March', 'Eventin', 'Ust-Luga', '100,000 tons', 'December', 'cargo', 'russian-assets', 'undermines', 'venezuelan-lawmaker', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'tankers', 'caribbean']",2025-12-23,2025-12-24,sputnikglobe.com

The EU’s financial system has benefited for decades from a reputation for stability  predictability  and political restraint. Sovereign investors from Asia  the Gulf and the Global South have viewed European financial infrastructure as relatively insulated from geopolitical turbulence. The perception that sovereign reserves can be repurposed under political pressure threatens to erode that trust.This is not a hypothetical concern. Efforts to diversify reserves  reduce exposure to Western financial systems and develop alternative clearing mechanisms have been accelerating for years. The frozen assets debate reinforces these trends by signaling that access to European financial institutions may be conditional and politically contingent. In the long run  this dynamic could weaken Europe’s financial influence(Excerpt) Read more at dailysabah.com ...TOPICS:Business/EconomyKEYWORDS:assetseuroclearinflatablefrogsrussiaukraineMessage from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends  We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

And guaranteed to be returned.To: Brian GriffinWho owns the freezer where the “frozen assets” are kept?To: Repeal The 17thIt’s complicated  but the answer to your question is maybe a surprise. The freezer is owned by Euroclear  which is not an EU entity. It is a private bank  with shareholders. It operates under the jurisdiction of Belgium. There has been a lot of “if we do this  then other countries with deposits might do something”. The council meeting outright failed and odds look pretty high that in that somewhat secretive meeting Euroclear informed them it’s not **might**. They were likely already told how far they can go (frozen) as opposed to outright spending it before the exodus of money *will* not **might** takes place. Frankly  I thought the EU would force the whole thing to happen if the word were **might**. The fact they failed completely suggests it was no longer **might** but *will*. People are not thinking about the next step upcoming. What happens if Russia were to conquer Ukraine entirely? Answer  all the accumulated debt becomes Russia’s. Can they refuse to pay? Probably  but that is not a return to normal commerce they would maybe prefer. Rather  I think this matter compels them to leave some minor part of Ukraine unconquered  and that part retains the debt.To: Brian GriffinWhy should this retired American even bother?To: Brian GriffinJust more good news for gold and silver  tbh.To: MarinerYou believe China’s “guarantees?”by 7 posted onby ConservativeMind (Trump: Befuddling Democrats  Republicans  and the Media for the benefit of the US and all mankind.)To: Terry L Smith“Why should this retired American even bother?” The Chinese work harder than Americans.

Honesty: “Thou shall not steal.” Read comment #2.To: Brian GriffinIn a way I hope they do it just so they can show their untrustworthiness. The reason I don’t want them to do it is that it will be a lifeline for Zelensky and a cash infusion into his personal fortune. At the same time it will prolong the war. I think the fact that EU is willing to replace their own population with hostile Islamists shows that they would have no hesitation to kill as many Ukrainians as it would take to keep the war going.by 9 posted onby webheart (Notice how I said all of that without any hyphens  and only complete words? )To: Owen“People are not thinking about the next step upcoming. What happens if Russia were to conquer Ukraine entirely? Answer  all the accumulated debt becomes Russia’s.” Lol. That is the most idiotic legal concept I ever heard. The debt will be on idiots who bankrolled the Kiev’s regime. And they’d owe Russia a lot in reparations.To: webheartlifeline for Zelensky and a cash infusion into his personal fortune. Sure  Europe buying US weapons and giving them to Ukraine is giving ""cash"" to Z. Okayby 11 posted onby tlozo (“We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin  if you want to know the truth ” Trump)To: NorseVikingI think my phrasing was poor. If Ukraine is conquered then the government of Ukraine becomes pro Russian. That debt would remain. It would be a burden on the pro Russian government. And given the Ukraine would have no revenue  the funding for that government would be coming from Moscow. Demands for payment by the creditors can be ignored  but the interest will continue to accumulate. A fundamental truism would unfold. There is no such thing as sovereign default. A country that owes money continues to owe money even if they declared default. The creditors have to agree to reduce the debt for it to be expunged. Just happened in Argentina and to an oblique extent  Greece too. There is no sovereign default. That cannot disappear from a country’s balance sheet unless the creditor agrees because there is no such thing as a sovereign bankruptcy Court  and empowered to expunge debt.To: Brian GriffinThe Euro’s seem to have dodged this issue for now. Why can’t the Euro’s legislate asset seizure only being permissible in a few certain cases: 1) Massive fraud involving the assets. 2) Attempt to annex land of another country by military force. And so on - in each case  the EU will have to decide on the effects of such rules on potential investment money vs. encouragement of good behavior. Then stick to those guidelines. ?? Consider the Wall Street example. If Dave commits fraud on Wall Street  is found guilty / fined  and the fine is greater than cash he can come up with  his assets (at least to make up the difference) after due process can be seized  no? As aside  I was looking at some estimates of cost of this war including “future fallout”  economic disruptions  lost or displaced productivity  etc.  out to around 2035 or so  a few days ago. Nobody seemed to really have a comprehensive answer (I should have saved some links anyway!)  but I’d guess the total cost to Europe (including Ukraine) will easily exceed $5 trillion  and will probably go over $10 trillion — if it ends this year. As former President Eisenhower said  “It’s an expensive business.”by 13 posted onby Paul R.

This follows the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).Wayrilz can help address the underlying causes of ITP through multi-immune modulation  targeting different pathways across the immune system.“ITP is caused by complex immune system dysregulation leading to low platelet counts  bleeding and other often overlooked symptoms that can affect both physical and mental health  significantly impacting quality of life ” said Waleed Ghanima  MD  Head of Research and a Consultant Hematologist at Østfold Hospital  Norway. “The traditional approach to disease management focuses on restoring platelet counts and reducing bleeding risk  but patients may still experience other symptoms. Wayrilz offers a new approach  targeting the underlying cause of ITP through multi-immune modulation to help address the multi-faceted burden of this disease.”“The approval of Wayrilz in the EU for the treatment of ITP underscores Sanofi’s commitment to leveraging our knowledge of the immune system to develop innovative treatments that make a meaningful impact on people living with rare and inflammatory diseases ” said Brian Foard  Executive Vice President  Head of Specialty Care at Sanofi. “Wayrilz has a differentiated mechanism of action  enabling multi-immune modulation to address the underlying pathology of ITP  allowing patients to benefit from an advanced treatment to help manage their disease.”The EU approval of Wayrilz is based on the pivotal LUNA 3 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766)  in which Wayrilz met the primary and secondary endpoints  demonstrating a positive impact on sustained platelet counts as well as other ITP symptoms.The LUNA 3 phase 3 study  presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition  and also published in Blood  evaluated the efficacy and safety of Wayrilz compared to placebo in adults (n=202) with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients who achieved platelet count response at 12 weeks were eligible to continue the full 24-week double-blind period (64% of patients in the Wayrilz arm and 32% of patients in the placebo arm). Patients receiving Wayrilz experienced the following compared to patients receiving placebo:Statistically significant durable platelet response at week 25 (23% of patients in Wayrilz arm vs. 0% in placebo arm; p<0.0001)Faster time to first platelet response (36 days in Wayrilz arm vs. not reached in placebo arm; p<0.0001)Longer duration of platelet response (least square mean of 7 weeks in Wayrilz arm vs. 0.7 weeks in placebo arm)Patients receiving Wayrilz reported an overall 10.6-point improvement in the overall quality of life domain compared to a 2.3-point increase in the placebo arm  based on The Immune Thrombocytopenia Patient Assessment Questionnaire  a clinical tool designed to measure ITP symptoms and impacts. The results of this analysis are descriptive and were not powered for statistical significance.The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea  nausea  headache  abdominal pain  and COVID-19.Wayrilz has already been approved in the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)  and it is currently under regulatory review for ITP in Japan and China. It received fast track and orphan drug designations (ODD) in the US for ITP  with similar orphan designations in the EU and Japan. In other indications under investigation  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Wayrilz ODD for three additional rare diseases  including warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA)  IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)  and sickle cell disease (SCD). Wayrilz also received FDA fast track designation and EU orphan designation in IgG4-RD.About the LUNA 3 studyLUNA 3 (clinical study identifier: NCT04562766) was a randomized  multicenter  phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Wayrilz vs. placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients received either oral Wayrilz 400 mg twice a day or placebo through a 12- to 24-week double-blind treatment period  followed by a 28-week open-label treatment period  and then a four-week safety follow-up or long-term extension period. The adolescent part of the study is ongoing. The primary endpoint for the EU is the proportion of adult participants able to achieve platelet counts at or above 50 000/μL for at least eight out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week blinded treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. Secondary endpoints included time to platelet response (platelet count ≥50 x 109/L or between 30 x 109/L and <50 x 109/L and at least doubled from baseline in absence of rescue therapy)  number of weeks maintaining a specific platelet response (i.e.  doubled or within range)  rescue therapy use  physical fatigue score  and bleeding score as assessed by change from baseline in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Bleeding Scale (IBLS) assessment at Week 25.About WayrilzWayrilz (rilzabrutinib) is the first BTK inhibitor for ITP that helps address the root cause of disease through multi-immune modulation. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in multiple immune-mediated disease processes and inflammatory pathways. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  Wayrilz can selectively inhibit the BTK target. This innovative therapy is now approved for ITP in the US  in the EU  and in the UAE. Regulatory review for use in ITP is currently ongoing in China and Japan.Wayrilz is being studied across a variety of rare diseases  including wAIHA  IgG4-RD  and SCD. These additional indications are currently under investigation and have not been approved by regulatory authorities.About ITPITP is a disease of complex immune dysregulation that causes low platelet counts (<100 000/μL)  resulting in a variety of bleeding symptoms and high risk of thromboembolism risk. Beyond bruising and bleeding  which can include potentially life-threatening episodes like intracranial hemorrhage  people living with ITP may experience reduced quality of life  including physical fatigue and cognitive impairment.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors In November  Volta Finance posted a net return of -0.6%  taking the year-to-date performance to +2.3%. For comparison  US High Yield bonds returned +7.8%*** and Euro High Yield bonds achieved +4.8% over the same period  while the Morningstar Leveraged Loan indices were up +5.2%*** in the US and +3.6% in Europe.This month  financial markets became more unpredictable. Many investors worried that technology company shares  especially those linked to artificial intelligence (AI)  might be overvalued. For example  after Nvidia’s earnings report  there were concerns that investments in AI are not yet delivering strong profits. This led to a sharp drop in technology share prices and increased market volatility. Some companies with a lot of AI exposure  like Oracle  saw the cost of insuring their debt (through credit default swap) go up.At the same time  economic data was mixed. The US economy showed some strength  but growth outside the technology sector was weak  and the job market continued to soften. Global events  such as political tensions and government decisions in the UK and Japan  also affected investor confidence. The US central bank kept interest rates steady and did not signal any cuts for December. However  as consumer confidence and retail sales weakened later in the month  many investors began to expect that interest rates might be cut soon.Turning to loans  the Morningstar LSTA Leveraged Loan Indices recorded returns of +0.32% in the US*** and +0.58% in Europe. While the European loan index had a relatively flat performance in terms of price variation  US Loans were slightly down although carry helped smooth their price impact. CLO tranches saw spreads stabilise for senior while Mezzanine tranches experienced spread widening  especially in Europe. European BB-rated CLOs reached +600 basis points notably for Reset Primary deals  while single-B from similar transactions reached +900 basis points. Regarding CLO Equity  credit concerns regarding tail in portfolios remained a focus in the context of Loan repricing squeezing value for Equity holders  although we noticed that distributions started to stabilise following a few quarters of steady decline.Volta Finance continued to invest actively in November  buying about €5.5 million worth of new investments. Most purchases were in new issues  which offered better value than in the secondary market. We invested in BB-rated and single-B rated tranches respectively in the +550bps context (US CLOs) and +925bps context (European CLOs) and participated in a European Equity tranche already owned by the fund. As a result  Volta Finance’s cash position decreased down to 13% of its assets. The fund generated about €26 million in cash flow  which is about 20% of November’s NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of performance breakdown  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -1.5%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +0.8% performance**.As of end of November 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €263.6m  i.e. €7.21 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.14% of Volta’s NAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The equivalent % proportions of Volta’s NAV as of 30 September and 31 August were 0.07% and 0.07%  respectively.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** These figures are presented in USD.

Additionally  data from EXCURSION (NCT03560466)  an open-label extension of VOYAGE that included a sub-study of exclusively Japanese pediatric patients supported the approval. In the VOYAGE study  Dupixent added to standard-of-care asthma therapy significantly reduced severe exacerbations (by 54% to 65%  p<0.0001) and improved lung function (by 4.68% to 5.32%  p=0.0012  p=0.0009 and p=0.0036  respectively) in the overall population  those with type 2 inflammation   and those with raised blood eosinophils  compared to placebo. In the sub-study of Japanese pediatric patients  Dupixent improved lung function from baseline at 12 weeks and resulted in a low rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year. The treatment-related adverse events most commonly reported with Dupixent were injection site reactions (erythema  edema  and induration) in VOYAGE and fever  oral herpes  eosinophilia  and injection site reactions (erythema and induration) in EXCURSION.Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing  and difficulty breathing. Additionally  impaired lung function in young children can have potentially long-lasting impacts such as reduced lung growth and persistent airway obstruction  if not addressed early. Patients also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities  like sleeping  attending school  and playing sports.In addition to asthma  Dupixent is approved in Japan in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dupixent has been approved in 50 countries around the world for the treatment of asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is available in Japan as a 200 mg or 300 mg pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen and is now available for children aged 6 to 11 years with asthma. Dupixent is intended for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and is given every two or four weeks based on weight. It can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  COPD  and BP in different age populations. More than 1.3 million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  lichen simplex chronicus  and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of bronchial asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe or refractory disease whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with existing therapy. This expands the previous approval in Japan in this indication for patients aged 12 years and older.The approval in Japan is based on data from the overall population and those with a type 2 inflammation phenotype (defined by raised blood eosinophils and/or fractional exhaled nitric oxide) in VOYAGE  a global Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Additionally  data from EXCURSION  an open-label extension of VOYAGE that included a sub-study of exclusively Japanese pediatric patients supported the approval. In the VOYAGE trial  Dupixent added to standard-of-care asthma therapy significantly reduced severe exacerbations (by 54% to 65%  p<0.0001) and improved lung function (by 4.68% to 5.32%  p=0.0012  p=0.0009 and p=0.0036  respectively) in the overall population  those with type 2 inflammation  and those with raised blood eosinophils  compared to placebo.

Dupixent has been approved in 50 countries around the world for the treatment of asthma in children aged 6 to 11 years.About DupixentDupixent is available in Japan as a 200 mg or 300 mg pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen and is now available for children aged 6 to 11 years with asthma. Dupixent is intended for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) and is given every two or four weeks based on weight. It can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  CSU  COPD and bullous pemphigoid (BP) in different age populations. More than 1 300 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.1About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes Dupixent® (dupilumab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg). In addition  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab) had been authorized by the FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  lichen simplex chronicus and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with AD under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled.
