54492,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://mypeoplesreview.com/2025/12/25/review-of-world-affairs-77/,Review of World Affairs,By Shashi P.B.B Malla To the chagrin of Russia  European leaders agreed last Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan […]The post Review of World Affairs appeared first on Peoples' Review.,Spread the loveEuropean Union Agrees to Extend Euro Loan to UkraineLegality of Trump’s Blockade of Venezuelan OilBy Shashi P.B.B MallaTo the chagrin of Russia  European leaders agreed last Friday to provide a massive interest-free loan to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years (AP/Associated Press  Dec. 19).However  they did not bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.In fact  after nearly four years of Russia’s aggressive war  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that Ukraine will need 137 billion euros (US Dollar $ 161 billion) in 2026 and 2027.The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy and desperately needs the funds by spring.The original plan had been to use some of the 210 billion euros worth of Russian frozen assets in Europe  mostly in Belgium.The leaders worked deep into Thursday night to reassure Belgium that they would protect it from any Russian retaliation if it backed the “reparations loan” plan.But in the end  the leaders did not use that option  but as the talks bogged down the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.“We have a deal. Decision to provide 90 billion euros of support to Ukraine for 2026-27 approved. We committed  we delivered ” EU Council President Antonio Costa said in a post on social media.[The European Council is responsible for setting the EU’s political agenda and providing impetus for its development. It should not be confused with the European Commission which is its executive arm].Not all countries agreed to the loan package.Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic refuse to support Ukraine and opposed it [forgetting that it is not only fighting for itself  but for the whole of Europe]  but a deal was reached in which they did not block the package and were promised protection from any financial fallout.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban  who is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe [and is also ‘beloved’ by Trump and his MAGA crowd] and describes himself as a peacemaker  said: “I would not like a European Union in war. To give means war.”[Orban also forgets that for all practical purposes  the EU is already at war on the side of Ukraine  supplying it with funds  arms and ammunition].Orban described the rejected plan to use the frozen Russian assets as a “dead end”.French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was a major advance  saying that borrowing on capital markets “was the most realistic and practical way” to fund Ukraine and its war efforts.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz  who had been the most prominent champion of using the Russian assets  also hailed the decision.“The financial package for Ukraine has been finalized ” Merz said in a statement  noting that “Ukraine is granted a zero-interest loan.”Merz added: “These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come.”He said the frozen assets will remain blocked until Russia has paid war reparations to Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that would amount to 600 billion euros.“If Russia does not pay reparations we will – in full accordance with international law – make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan ” Merz said.Zelensky  who travelled to Brussels for a summit that took place during fiery protests by farmers angry about a proposed trade deal with five South American countries  had appealed for a quick decision to keep Ukraine afloat in the new year.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned early on Thursday that it would be a case of sending “either money today or blood tomorrow” to help Ukraine.The plan to use frozen Russian assets got bogged down as Belgian Prime Minister rejected the scheme as legally risky and warned that it could harm the business of Euroclear  the Brussels-based financial clearing house where 193 billion euros in frozen Russian assets are held.Belgium was rattled last Friday when Russia’s Central Bank launched a lawsuit against Euroclear to prevent any loan being provided to Ukraine using its money  which is frozen under EU sanctions slapped on Moscow after it launched its full-scale aggressive war in February 2022.Russia claims its military goals will be achievedRussian President Vladimir Putin said last Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine [although at snail’s pace]  voicing confidence that the Kremlin’s military goals would be achieved (AP  Dec. 19).However  with the recent shot in the arms from the EU  Ukraine will be able to outlast Putin’s war for at least another two years. Whether that is the case with Putin’s war-torn and devastated economy  is anybody’s guess.Speaking at his highly orchestrated year-end news conference  Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized the strategic initiative” and would make more gains by the year’s end. [This is more bravado than reality].But it is true that Russia’s better-equipped and larger army has made slow but steady and incremental progress in Ukraine in recent months.The annual live news conference is combined with novel nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of Putin  who has led the country for 25 years.Putin  who is divorced  was even asked about his love life and is reported to have blushed!This year  observers were watching for Putin’s remarks on Ukraine and the US-backed peace plan there.US President Donald Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.But Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.Above all  the US is not applying the same amount of pressure on Moscow as it has on Kyiv.Putin reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement – but only on his own sweet terms!Moreover  the settlement would have to address the “root causes of the conflict”.This means nothing else than that Putin is insisting on his own terms for ending the conflict – that is  he is dictating the terms.Unfortunately  Trump is ready to appease  and the European leaders are too chicken-hearted to resist his soft corner for Putin.Earlier last week  Putin warned that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin demands.Thus  in the negotiations  Putin is not willing to make any concessions at all – and a consensus cannot be reached. His attitude is hardened because he is aware that the Trump and the US are on his side.Is this not a very peculiar situation in the so-called diplomatic negotiations? The US is supposed to be the peace mediator  but it is openly and decisively leaning towards Moscow.The Russian leader wants all the areas in four key regions captured – not wholly – by his forces  as well as the Crimean Peninsula  which was illegally annexed back in 2014 [when the Western Powers did nothing  in spite of security guarantees]. All these are to recognized as Russian territory.Putin has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured as yet – demands that Kyiv has rightfully rejected.VenezuelaPresident Donald Trump’s ‘blockade’ of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela’s coast is raising new question about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America  while fueling concerns that the US could be edging closer to a hot war [which would rightly require authorization by the US Congress  as before the 2003 Iraq War].The Trump administration says its blockade is narrowly tailored and not targeting civilians  which would be an illegal act of war.But some experts say seizing sanctioned oil tied to leader Nicolas Maduro could provoke a military response from Venezuela  engaging American forces in a new level of conflict that goes beyond their attacks on alleged drug boats.“My biggest fear is this is how wars start and how conflicts escalate out of control ” said Representative Jason Crow  a Colorado Democrat who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.“And there are no adults in the room with this administration  nor is there consultation with Congress. So I’m very worried.”Claire Finkelstein  a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania  said the use of such an aggressive tactic without congressional authority stretches the bounds of international law and increasingly looks like a veiled attempt to trigger a Venezuelan response.“The concern is that we are bootstrapping our way into armed conflict ” Finkelstein said.“We’re upping the ante in order to try to get them to engage in an act of aggression that would then justify an act of self-defense on our part” (AP).Trump has used the word ‘blockade’ to describe his latest tactic in an escalating pressure campaign against Maduro  who has been charged with narco-terrorism in the US and now has been accused of using oil profits to fund drug trafficking.While Trump says it only applies to vessels facing US economic penalties  the move has sparked outrage among Democrats and mostly shrugs  if not cheers  from Republicans.The president has declared the US is in ‘armed conflict’ with drug cartels in an effort to reduce the flow of drugs to American communities.US seizes oil tanker off coast of Venezuela  againThe United States again ‘apprehended’ an oil tanker off Venezuela last Saturday  in the latest salvo of a pressure campaign by Washington  the Us government said.Caracas slammed the seizure as theft and kidnapping  saying ‘those responsible for these serious events will answer to justice and to history for their criminal conduct.’Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez voiced defiance: “We are waging a battle against lies  manipulation  interference  military threats  and psychological warfare ” adding “that will not intimidate us” (AFP/Agence France Presse  Dec. 21).The writer can be reached at:shashimalla125@gmail.com,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.09,0.22,0.69,True,English,"['World Affairs', 'Review', 'Shashi P.B.B Malla', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'EU Council President Antonio Costa', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky', 'Brussels-based financial clearing house', 'five South American countries', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Belgian Prime Minister', 'The European Council', 'year-end news conference', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Russian immobilized assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'massive interest-free loan', 'next two years', 'full-scale aggressive war', 'frozen assets', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian forces', 'financial fallout', 'international law', 'financial package', 'four years', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'Venezuelan Oil', 'economic needs', 'AP/Associated Press', '137 billion euros', 'US Dollar', '210 billion euros', 'capital markets', '90 billion euros', 'social media', 'political agenda', 'executive arm', 'Czech Republic', 'closest ally', 'MAGA crowd', 'practical purposes', 'major advance', 'practical way', 'prominent champion', 'budgetary needs', '600 billion euros', 'full accordance', 'fiery protests', '193 billion euros', 'Central Bank', 'EU sanctions', 'recent shot', 'devastated economy', 'strategic initiative', 'Euro Loan', 'zero-interest loan', 'means war', 'war efforts', 'reparations loan', 'loan package', 'Thursday night', 'new year', 'military goals', 'European leaders', 'war reparations', 'dead end', 'quick decision', 'original plan', 'trade deal', 'love', 'Ukraine', 'Legality', 'Trump', 'Blockade', 'chagrin', 'Dec.', 'differences', 'Belgium', 'funds', 'fact', 'IMF', 'government', 'Kyiv', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'spring', 'option', 'talks', 'money', 'support', 'post', 'impetus', 'development', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'protection', 'peacemaker', 'arms', 'ammunition', 'borrowing', 'realistic', 'statement', 'summit', 'place', 'farmers', 'case', 'blood', 'scheme', 'business', 'Euroclear', 'lawsuit', 'Moscow', 'February', 'troops', 'battlefield', 'snail', 'pace', 'confidence', 'Kremlin', 'war-torn', 'gains', 'reality']",2025-12-25,2025-12-25,mypeoplesreview.com

The US...,Sanofi provides update on tolebrutinib regulatory submission in non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosisParis  December 24  2025. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the new drug application of tolebrutinib to treat non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (nrSPMS) in adult patients.On December 15  2025  Sanofi provided an update on the ongoing review which stated that: (i) FDA was expecting the review to go beyond the previously communicated revised US target action date of December 28  2025; (ii) further guidance from the FDA was expected by the end of the first quarter of 2026; and (iii) in response to an FDA request  Sanofi had submitted an expanded access protocol for tolebrutinib in nrSPMS. The announcement was based on the latest discussions with the FDA  which took place just before the update was provided.“Today’s FDA decision is a significant and meaningful change in direction from the feedback the agency previously provided to Sanofi. We are very disappointed by the FDA's action. Disability progression remains a large unmet medical need in MS  and tolebrutinib was previously awarded breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in recognition of its potential to address this critical gap. We believe that the FDA should also take the advice of scientific experts  clinicians  and patients in this matter to ensure all perspectives are considered. We remain committed to working with the FDA to find a path forward for tolebrutinib and ultimately serve the MS community ” said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research & Development at Sanofi.Tolebrutinib was provisionally approved in the United Arab Emirates in July 2025 for the treatment of non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and to slow disability accumulation independent of relapse activity in adults. It is currently under regulatory review in the EU and other jurisdictions worldwide.Financial considerationsAs communicated on December 15  2025  Sanofi is conducting an impairment test in accordance with IFRS (IAS 36) on the intangible asset value attached to tolebrutinib with a status to be provided with Q4 and FY 2025 results in January 2026. The outcome of this test will have no impact to the business net income / business EPS and there is no change to the financial guidance for 2025.About tolebrutinibTolebrutinib is an investigational  oral  brain-penetrant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target smoldering neuroinflammation  a key driver of disability progression in MS.

Sanofi...,Sanofi to acquire Dynavax  adding a marketed adult hepatitis B vaccine and phase 1/2 shingles candidate to the pipelineParis  December 24  2025. Sanofi announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Dynavax)  a publicly traded vaccines company with a marketed adult hepatitis B vaccine (HEPLISAV-B®) and differentiated shingles vaccine candidate. The acquisition augments Sanofi’s presence in adult immunization by bringing together Dynavax’s vaccines with Sanofi’s global scale  development capabilities and commercial reach.Dynavax’s adult hepatitis B vaccine HEPLISAV-B is currently marketed in the US and is differentiated by its two-dose regimen over one month  which enables high levels of seroprotection faster than other hepatitis B vaccines  which are given in three doses over six months.The acquisition also includes Dynavax’s shingles vaccine candidate (Z-1018)  which is currently in phase 1/2 clinical development and additional vaccine pipeline projects.“Dynavax enhances Sanofi’s adult immunization presence by adding differentiated vaccines that complement Sanofi’s expertise ” said Thomas Triomphe  Executive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi. “Its marketed adult hepatitis B vaccine and shingles candidate bring new options to our portfolio and underscore our commitment to providing vaccine protection across the lifespan.”“Joining Sanofi will provide the global scale and expertise needed to maximize the impact of our vaccine portfolio ” said Ryan Spencer  Chief Executive Officer  Dynavax. “We believe Sanofi’s commercial reach  development capabilities  and commitment to evidence-based immunization will amplify the opportunity for HEPLISAV-B and our innovative pipeline to address important public health needs  further advancing our mission to help protect the world against infectious disease. We are confident that this transaction – and the compelling value it provides – is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.”Hepatitis B and shingles represent a significant public unmet health need and adult vaccination opportunities. In the US alone  nearly 100 million adults born before 1991 remain unvaccinated  with many potentially at risk for infection. Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus can cause liver damage and lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Shingles  which is caused by the varicella zoster virus  affects one in three adults over their lifetime  according to the World Health Organization. In most people  shingles causes a painful  itchy rash but  in some cases it can lead to long-term nerve pain  serious eye infections that can damage the vision  and  rarely  to dangerous inflammation of the brain.Financial considerationsUnder the terms of the merger agreement  Sanofi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Dynavax for $15.50 per share in cash  reflecting a total equity value of approximately $2.2 billion.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Dynavax board of directors. The consummation of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions  including the tender of a number of shares of Dynavax common stock that represent at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Dynavax common stock  the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976  certain foreign regulatory filings and clearances  and other customary conditions.If the tender offer is successfully completed  then following the successful completion of the tender offer  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with and into Dynavax  and all of the outstanding Dynavax common stock that are not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $15.50 per share in cash offered to Dynavax shareholders in the tender offer.Sanofi plans to fund the acquisition with available cash resources.The agreement to acquire Dynavax is not expected to have any impact on Sanofi’s financial guidance for 2025. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions  the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.About HEPLISAV-BHEPLISAV-B is an adult hepatitis B vaccine that combines hepatitis B surface antigen with Dynavax's vaccine adjuvant  a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist  to enhance the immune response.HEPLISAV‑B is an injection given to adults 18 years of age and older to help prevent infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. HEPLISAV‑B is usually given in the arm muscle. HEPLISAV‑B is given in two doses  one month apart  by a healthcare provider.Important safety informationDo not take HEPLISAV-B if you have a history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine  or to any ingredient of HEPLISAV‑B  including yeast. HEPLISAV‑B must be given by a medical professional  who will monitor you afterwards  to check for allergic reaction. If you are immunocompromised  or receiving immunosuppressant therapy  you may have less of an immune response to HEPLISAV‑B.Some people have hepatitis B infection without being aware of it or showing any symptoms. If you already have hepatitis B present in your body  HEPLISAV‑B may not prevent hepatitis B infection.The most common side effects include pain at the injection site  tiredness  and headache.Tell your provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast feeding.Vaccination with HEPLISAV‑B may not protect all individuals.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people's lives and delivering compelling growth.
