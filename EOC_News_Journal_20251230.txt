54501,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/630203-us-peace-eu-war/,The EU has everything to gain from peace. Why does it keep insisting on war?,At the very moment America steps back from the abyss  Western European elites are pushing the continent closer to it Read Full Article at RT.com,At the very moment America steps back from the abyss  Western European elites are pushing the continent closer to itEurope is no longer sleepwalking into disaster. It is marching toward it with wide-open eyes  clenched fists  and a disturbing sense of moral self-satisfaction. At the very moment when the United States  under Donald Trump’s leadership  is returning to diplomacy  restraint  and strategic realism  the European Union’s governing elite is choosing escalation  economic self-harm  and permanent confrontation with Russia.This is ideological obsession masquerading as virtue. Nothing captures this moral and intellectual collapse more clearly than the EU’s recent push to expropriate Russia’s frozen sovereign assets. Brussels and Berlin have been aggressively pressuring member states to approve a plan to seize up to €210 billion in Russian state funds and funnel them into Ukraine. It is a frontal assault on the principles of sovereign immunity and property rights that underpin the global financial system – and the EU’s own credibility within it.The fact that this plan was ever taken seriously reveals how far the European leaders have drifted from reality. Confiscating sovereign assets sets a precedent that will haunt the EU for decades  shattering trust among international investors and signaling that legal guarantees in Europe are conditional on political fashion.Belgium  of all countries  became the unlikely voice of reason. Because most of the frozen Russian assets are held by Euroclear  a firm registered on Belgian soil  Brussels understood the obvious: when Russia inevitably challenges this theft in international arbitration  Belgium – not the European Commission – will be left holding the bill. Rather than acknowledging this legitimate concern  EU leaders considered outvoting Belgium altogether  sacrificing national sovereignty on the altar of ideological obsession.This is what the European Union has become: a bloc that lectures the world about the rule of law while actively conspiring to destroy it when inconvenient.The reckoning came at the December 18–19 EU summit in Brussels. After sixteen exhausting hours  European governments failed to reach an agreement on confiscating Russian assets. It was a humiliating defeat for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and for Friedrich Merz  who has increasingly positioned himself as Germany’s most aggressive advocate of confrontation with Moscow.But instead of stepping back  EU leaders did what they always do when reality intrudes: they borrowed money.Unable to steal Russian assets outright  the EU agreed on an 'emergency' plan based on €90 billion in joint EU debt – money that will be transferred to Kiev and never repaid. This is not aid; it is a permanent transfer of wealth from European taxpayers to prolong a war that the EU has already lost strategically.European citizens were not consulted. They never are. They will simply pay – through higher debt servicing  inflation  and reduced public spending – while being lectured about values and sacrifice by the same elites who will never bear the consequences of their decisions.Yet even in this climate of hysteria  cracks are forming. Czechia  Hungary  and Slovakia refused to follow Brussels off the cliff. Their leaders – Andrej Babiš  Viktor Orbán  and Robert Fico – stood against asset confiscation  endless debt  and permanent war. In doing so  they articulated a sovereigntist  peace-oriented vision that is quietly gaining ground across Central Europe  understanding a simple truth Brussels refuses to face: the EU cannot build its future on the permanent demonization of its largest neighbor.It is no accident that this shift coincides with clear signals from Washington. The Trump administration has made it plain: it will support patriotic forces in Europe willing to challenge liberal dogma and endless war. For the first time in years  European dissenters are no longer isolated.What terrifies Brussels is not Russia  but the possibility that EU citizens might realize another path exists.European progressivists and liberal globalists have driven themselves into a kind of collective hysteria. Anyone who questions escalation is branded immoral. Anyone who speaks of negotiation is accused of betrayal. The result is a foreign policy driven not by outcomes  but by emotional conformity and performative outrage. Europe’s leaders talk endlessly about values yet ignore consequences.Donald Trump described the EU as a decaying collection of countries ruled by weak leaders. The response from the European Commission was pure denial: a self-congratulatory declaration of gratitude for its “excellent leaders ” starting with von der Leyen herself. Nothing could better illustrate the chasm between the EU’s governing class and the societies they claim to represent.Reality  meanwhile  intrudes. Friedrich Merz has now openly admitted what many feared: NATO troops could end up fighting Russia directly in Ukraine. This is no longer a hypothetical risk. It is a logical endpoint of Europe’s current trajectory. Escalation begets escalation. Red lines dissolve. What began as 'support' inches closer to direct confrontation between nuclear powers.At the same time  the EU continues to sabotage itself economically. Just days ago  an overwhelming majority of members of the European Parliament voted to ban imports of Russian gas starting in late 2027. Once again  this was framed as independence and prosperity. Once again  it will deliver the opposite.Energy prices will rise permanently. Industry will continue to flee. Ordinary Europeans will pay more to live poorer lives – all while being told this is necessary for moral reasons. Hungary and Slovakia have already announced legal action against Brussels  recognizing the ban for what it is: economic vandalism dressed up as virtue.Combined with radical green policies and aggressive cultural progressivism  this agenda is not merely misguided – it is suicidal. The EU is transforming itself into a zone of economic stagnation  social tension  and strategic irrelevance. Spengler’s “decline of the West” no longer reads like prophecy. It reads like a daily briefing.Against this backdrop  Trump’s approach to Russia looks restorative. Washington increasingly understands that endless proxy war benefits no one – least of all Ukraine. The Trump administration’s goal is clear: end the war  stabilize the region  rebuild Ukraine for people to live normal lives  and restore pragmatic engagement with Russia.This is what responsible great-power politics looks like. That realism extends to the global order. The White House’s regret over Russia’s expulsion from the G8 and its openness to new formats – a “core five” of the US  China  Russia  India  and Japan – reflect a clear-eyed assessment of power. These are the states that shape global outcomes. The EU  for all its rhetoric  does not. Its absence from such a framework is not an insult  simply a consequence.The EU has excluded itself through its own arrogance and delusion. By outsourcing strategy to ideology and leadership to bureaucracy  it has made itself irrelevant. Ironically  Europe would still be represented indirectly – by Russia  which increasingly positions itself as a defender of traditional European civilizational values abandoned by the Western European elites.The great  unspoken truth is this: Europe has everything to gain from US-Russia rapprochement. Peace would mean cheaper energy  revived trade  reduced security risks  and space to repair Europe’s internal fractures. Normal relations with Moscow are not a concession. They are a necessity.Yet Brussels resists peace with astonishing determination. Why? Because peace would force accountability. It would expose years of catastrophic misjudgment. It would shatter the myth of moral infallibility that the EU’s ruling class clings to so desperately.Trump’s America is moving forward. Western Europe is digging in.Unless the EU realigns. Unless it abandons its war obsession and restores diplomacy  it will continue its slide into decline. Peace is not Europe’s enemy.

We are in the middle of the festive period with sunny and pleasant weather  though it has been quite a hassle for travelers who went on winter getaways  even amidst roadblocks. From the official data we have (airports  national roads)  traffic hasn’t decreased compared to last year despite the obstacles  though there were quite a few cancellations (I hear especially in Pelion)  as well as arrivals at resorts delayed by a day or two. Meanwhile  what farmers gained from all this fuss is hard to understand—perhaps only a few points in public support for the KKE  which has been persistent these days—while most union leaders realize the matter isn’t likely to continue much further and would do well to enter a formal dialogue  gain a bit more (they were given everything except Europe’s disarmament!) and then remove the tractors from the roads. Last week  we witnessed the drama of the old-school political figure Anestidis (a longtime supporter of Rafina)  who  after claiming to be a blue supporter since the ERE era  was almost crying on TV with a cheese pie in hand  insisting he did nothing  while… the prosecutor’s investigation found otherwise. The day before yesterday  there was another “star ” a certain Bota  who claimed that “the Mitsotakis family cut his child’s milk via account seizures ” while pretending to know nothing; yet the prosecutor’s official memo showed he had declared around twenty fake fields and received over a hundred thousand euros from OPEKEPE. I hear that 3–4 other farmers  not union leaders  are in the same category  whose accounts were frozen  and of course  they don’t come out to speak with the brazenness of the farm union leaders.Dialogue…Logically  some movement regarding dialogue is expected from today. Yesterday  another public invitation was made by the representative Marinakis—and possibly Mitsotakis himself. Ultimately  it’s likely that a meeting will take place with Tsiaras and some farmer representatives  mainly from Northern Greece. At KKE  while serious professional farm union leaders always knew how far to push things  due to perceived leftist threats (Zoi  Karystianou  etc.)  there’s concern about losing influence  and people seem somewhat confused.Time for reshuffle speculationEvery year around this time  just before the New Year  reshuffle scenarios appear—it’s like the “Halcyon days.” This year  the scenario suggests that K.M will wait for “OPEKEPE file No.2” to see who will face issues from the case  and after those involved resign  he will proceed with a reshuffle  not just there  but also in other positions he wants to change. The latest version I’ve heard is that  from the recorded conversations of the European Prosecutor  a deputy and a party official from ND are involved  not a minister (seriously). So  as things stand  nothing urgent is happening. How Mitsotakis will execute a broader reshuffle at this time—and who will be replaced or added without upsetting those left out—I cannot imagine yet. But we are here to write; the column exists…Mitsotakis interviewThe days may be relaxed  but Mitsotakis wants to review the past year  which wasn’t easy. That’s why he will give his last interview of 2025 on Action24’s show “Better Late” with Athinaida Nega  expected to air tonight.Environmental Studies for Marine ParksAnother act of national sovereignty is unfolding these days: the Ministry of Environment and Energy is preparing to publish Special Environmental Studies for two new national marine parks  Ionian and South Aegean 1–Southern Cyclades. As Minister Stavros Papastavrou promised  this will happen before the end of the year. The next step is sending the relevant Presidential Decrees to the Council of State. With the two new parks  Greece formally—and earlier than expected—reaches the 30×30 target (over 30% of its marine ecosystem protected by 2030)  specifically placing about 35% of its marine areas under protection.Nikitas and the 5%Over the weekend  it may have gone unnoticed that Parliament President Nikitas Kaklamanis  in an interview  supported raising the parliamentary entry threshold from 3% to 5%. This implies an intervention in the electoral law  something many ND deputies want  though Mitsotakis rejects it. Even though Nikitas shared his personal view  he does not speak randomly  as he gauges the “temperature” among deputies. Some clever observers think an initiative could come “from below” rather than from M.M.Pierrakakis and GEK TERNA bring good newsStarting with the positive market news  as today we also have sad mishaps with EXAE. Firstly  Pierrakakis seems determined to tidy up his ministry’s mess. From an interview with “Kathimerini ” we learned that by the end of the year—possibly today—the Ministry of Finance will announce the contractor for the Property Leasing and Reacquisition Agency for vulnerable borrowers. I won’t claim the issue is resolved until the tender concludes  but it’s a step forward  as the Agency  enabling “red” loan liquidations  has been pending for over five years—maybe more; honestly  I don’t remember exactly. The second significant event in the coming days is tomorrow  Tuesday 30/12  the signing of the concession for the Egnatia Odos for 35 years to the GEK TERNA (75%) – Egis (25%) consortium. The state will receive €1.269 billion  ending a pending matter dating back to August 2021  when TAIPED—now in a different form—awarded Egnatia to GEK TERNA – Egis.New EYDAP tariffs approved tomorrowAlso note that tomorrow  December 30  the proposal from EYDAP regarding major changes in water and sewage tariffs will be presented for approval to the Regulatory Authority of Waste  Energy  and Water (RAAEY). According to the proposal  the fixed charge will triple from €1 to €3  now including a €1 sewage fee  along with a doubling of water costs (from €1 to €2). These changes mark a substantial adjustment to EYDAP’s tariffs after 17 years of stagnant  low rates. The Ministry of Environment and Energy  EYDAP  and RAAEY are fully coordinated  aiming for the increases to take effect early next year  generating estimated additional annual revenue of around €400 million over the next five years  enhancing the company’s financial sustainability and enabling investments in water and sewage infrastructure.The fiasco with the general meeting of EXAENow to the unfortunate mishaps. Not everything was conducted by the book  as the outgoing EXAE chairman claimed  at the recent extraordinary general meeting of EXAE  which now has to be repeated. The December 22 general meeting  which was supposed to “seal” the developments for the transition to Euronext  turned into a legal thriller. It all started with objections from shareholder and lawyer Konstantinos Drougas  who “picked” the dates. The invitation should have been issued by November 28 but was only sent on December 1—a three-day difference  which legally translates into a “legality issue.” The outgoing chairman  Giorgos Chantzinikolaou  insisted  wrongly as it turned out  that everything was “by the book” and completed the process  but the legal advisors apparently saw potential invalidity. To avoid lingering “shadows” and objections over the new board  the administration decided to take a safety step. Therefore  the previous GM is now considered “never held ” and shareholders are called again on January 20  2026. If a quorum is not reached (likely  given the mobilization of the canceled GM)  the meeting will move to January 27. The agenda? Exactly the same: a new  smaller board—reducing members from 11 to 9. The dual goal is to reduce operating costs (confirmed by Chantzinikolaou) and fully align with the Euronext model. Essentially  the Greek stock exchange is beginning to “speak” the language of the pan-European group  with Giannos Kondopoulos remaining CEO to manage the transition.Holiday embarrassment of magnitudeDon’t expect peace on January 20. Some shareholders have already drawn their “swords ” questioning both the legality of Euronext’s acquisition of shares and the validity of proxy voting. It’s certain that EXAE’s legal team will have a lot of work in 2026. Personally  being naturally suspicious  I don’t dismiss market rumors suggesting that behind the GM fiasco could lie the difficult relationship between Chantzinikolaou and Kondopoulos. Kondopoulos  initially far from enthusiastic about Euronext  changed his stance after a conciliatory approach  and since the CEO-chairman relationship hasn’t always been smooth  it’s possible the dates got confused. But  to be fair  Kondopoulos as CEO (earning €500 000) is also exposed  since this is a full-blown embarrassment. Pier worked hard to bring Euronext  and the meeting will be repeated due to a three-day miscount? That’s life: you get what you pay for. In EXAE’s case  the saying “after the removal from the treasury” seems fitting.Many “brides ” one deal  and a dividend that makes noiseIt’s known in the market that National Bank is very close to a deal with NN. According to sources  technical issues still prevent an official announcement. Banking insiders emphasize that  especially now that Piraeus Bank finalized its agreement with Ethniki Insurance  the National Bank management will not announce results in late February or early March without first finalizing and disclosing this deal. The part still unfinalized concerns collaboration with a non-life insurance company  as the NN deal relates exclusively to health-life insurance. In the past  National Bank was close to Allianz  but today there are more “suitors.” Many insurance companies are offering very attractive proposals  creating a strategic and financial dilemma for the management. Despite this  National Bank has  supposedly  the “disadvantage” of capital accumulation but maintains by far the strongest balance sheet among banks. With no Swiss franc exposure  no step-up  low fees for managing NPLs via servicers  and no pending synthetic securitizations  the bank is expected to distribute a dividend significantly higher than the already announced 60%. Notably  a JP Morgan report estimated distributions could reach up to 100% of 2026 profits. For 2025  the 60% payout is considered conservative  with many expecting dividends around 70–80%.Paulson’s stake rises… without purchasesPaulson & Co’s stake in Piraeus Bank rose slightly to 14.18%  from roughly 14% previously. However  this change was not due to new stock purchases but purely technical reasons: the bank canceled 14 million shares in an interim €100 million distribution. As a result  Paulson appears to hold a larger percentage of the bank without materially changing its investment position or indicating any substantive development.End of an era for Marinopoulos–Marks & SpencerQuietly  one of the oldest partnerships in Greek retail ended. The Marinopoulos family fully exited the joint venture with the British multinational Marks & Spencer  selling its remaining 20%. The sale of Marinopoulos Holding’s stake occurred just before the end of the last fiscal year  March 2025  according to financial statements released on Christmas Day. This marks the gradual divestment of the Marinopoulos family from a partnership spanning decades  accelerated after the group’s collapse and the crisis years. For the record  in 2024/25  the Greek company recorded: sales €71.65 million  net profit €2.05 million  cash €10.05 million.Proodeftiki: Trial postponement and critical shareholder meeting on January 5The first legal battle between major shareholder Chrysas Koutla and the board of the listed construction company PROODEFTIKI over the controversial capital increase was postponed to January 22  2026. This was the second postponement. The initial hearing was scheduled for December 12 but postponed at the company’s representative request due to the lawyer’s unavailability. The rescheduled hearing moved to December 23 but was again postponed by mutual agreement  now to January 22. PROODEFTIKI publicly committed not to complete the announced capital increase before the general meeting on January 5  effectively leaving the critical decision to shareholders. However  the company’s announcement to the Stock Exchange was not entirely accurate  omitting that the first postponement was its own request and the second arose from joint agreement of both parties’ lawyers. The January 5 meeting will decide on the fate of the financing agreement with LDA Capital Ltd signed in September 2022 but never executed. Shareholder participation already exceeds the percentage that initially approved the deal. Koutla’s 16% dissent focuses on the usefulness and prudence of a non-executed agreement  which entails abandoning plans and the pursuit of a strategic investor.Fragkou buys building on Akti MiaouliAngeliki Fragkou purchased the iconic building at Akti Miaouli 85 and Flessa 2  where Navios has its offices. She tried to acquire the entire building but hit a wall  as the 4th and 6th floors belong to Cosco Hellas  which has no intention of leaving  and the 2nd floor houses the Hellenic Shipowners’ Association offices  currently undergoing extensive renovation. The association aims to inaugurate the renovated offices before the global shipping event  the Posidonia Exhibition  scheduled for the first week of June 2026.Dividends… even from the beachThe column has highlighted several times how “golden” the investment by the Arab-Turkish consortium that acquired Astir Vouliagmeni proved to be. Although the iconic complex has now passed into the hands of shipowner Giorgos Prokopios  the former owners continue to receive dividends from profits of previous years. For example  for the recent fiscal year 01.01.2024 – 31.12.2024  the (former) shareholder Apollo Investment Holdco S.A. was allocated a partial dividend of USD 746 873.87 (converted to euros at the applicable exchange rate). It was clarified that “this amount will be used to repay an existing debt to the law firm Dechert LLP  while the remaining profits will stay in the company as retained earnings to maintain liquidity.” Moreover  the General Assembly of Astir Beach S.A. decided to distribute a dividend of €72 882.61 from 2024 profits to the (former) sole shareholder  Apollo Investment Holdco S.A. In other words  they are still collecting even from the beach at Astir.Danaos’ long-term betDanaos’ recent charter of the Rio Grande by Giannis Coustas for MSC impresses more for its duration than the headline rate. At $29 000/day for 32 months  analysts note that it’s not top-of-market but locks in cash flows over a cycle that  despite current strength  remains cyclical. For Danaos and Greek control in this sector  it translates into reduced earnings volatility risk—valued by institutional investors more than short-term freight maximization. In a higher-interest  tighter capital evaluation environment  such agreements serve as cash-flow smoothing tools rather than aggressive growth plays.Christmas with… orders  not cookiesWhile most are in a festive mood  Greek shipowners apparently spent Christmas at shipyards. In Greek shipping  there are no holidays  only delivery slots. Last week  Greek owners maintained a “strong presence” in newbuilds  signaling fleet renewal regardless of season or geopolitical climate. TMS Cardiff Marine  of Giorgos Oikonomou  raised the bar by expanding its 11 400 TEU containership program at Zhoushan Changhong with eight orders and two optional LNG dual-fuel ships for 2029 delivery. Simply put  while Brussels debates regulations and targets  Greeks place newbuild orders. Interestingly  there were no Greek deals in the secondhand market. The “gift under the tree” this year is a newbuild  not a secondhand bargain. Over the last 12 months  Greek interests have placed 134 newbuild orders and acquired 179 secondhand ships  sending a clear message: the Greek-owned fleet is not merely renewing—it’s being redesigned for 2026.Greeks leading in feeders2025 has emerged as the year of feeder containerships (1 000–3 000 TEU)  with Greek shipowners at the forefront globally. According to Intermodal Shipbrokers  feeders remain the only container segment with strong  consistent investment interest despite market fluctuations. Of 133 containerships ordered by Greek interests  71 are feeders—22.6% of the global orderbook in this category. Globally  194 new feeders were built in 2025  bringing the total orderbook to 314—nearly triple the year’s start. This is driven by fleet fundamentals and shifting trade flows. The average feeder age exceeds 15 years  with over a quarter over 20 years old  meaning accelerated retirements under stricter environmental standards. Key Greek players include Costamare (Kostis Konstantakopoulos)  Danaos (Giannis Coustas)  and Chartworld Shipping (Lou Kollakis)  often pairing orders with long-term charters. Capital Group is especially active with 19 of 35 feeders on order  and Minerva Group (Andreas Martinos Jr.) is strengthening its container presence. New entrants like Alpha Bulkers (Anna Angelicou)  Marla Dry Bulk (Latsis family)  and Venergy Maritime (V Group/Bryon Vassiliadis) highlight feeders as a strategic pillar for the next phase of Greek container shipping.China changes the game in silverThe Chinese government announced that from January 1  2026  new restrictions on silver exports will require government licenses for each shipment. This year was already historic for silver  with prices up +175% and an eight-month streak  the first since 1980. On the Shanghai exchange  silver trades at $85/oz  $5 higher than in the U.S. In December alone  silver rose +41%  its best monthly performance since December 1979. Along with gold  precious metals added $16 trillion in capitalization this year. The rally started from the dollar’s weakness  which lost -9% in 2025—the worst year since 2017. Fed rate cuts and POTUS announcements fueled the rally  with Trump stating rates could fall to 1% or lower  pending the new Fed Chair. Bonds are under pressure; bond ETFs have dropped -12% since September  reflecting high long-term inflation expectations. China’s export restrictions and the structural supply deficit have intensified the market. Industrial demand (electronics  solar  EV batteries) remains strong  and investment demand is rising amid geopolitical uncertainty  making 2026 a challenging year.Solved: U.S. inflation mysteryThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  the U.S. counterpart of Greece’s ELSTAT  is the main agency measuring labor  wages  productivity  and inflation since 1884. In December  BLS announced a sudden  unexpected drop in November inflation to 2.7%  against analysts’ 3%+ estimates. However  it was revealed that almost 40% of the structural inflation data for October–November relied on estimates  not actual prices  due to the prolonged government shutdown. BLS is designed to track 90 000 monthly price observations across 200 categories. Historically  estimated entries covered ~10% when data were missing; this year  for five consecutive months  estimates exceeded 30%. This issue affects more than statistics. When the Fed sets rates based on data one-third extrapolated  monetary policy shifts from science to philosophical speculation. Markets react to numbers increasingly reflecting models  not reality. BLS should theoretically rely on extensive household and business surveys  with hundreds of thousands of monthly observations  making credibility critical for economic policy. The recent rise in estimated vs. measured data raises analysts’ concerns.,neutral,0.01,0.72,0.27,mixed,0.17,0.1,0.73,True,English,"['Alkyonides days', 'cabinet reshuffle', 'electoral threshold', 'Christmas cookies', 'farmer-bosses', 'prosecutors', 'Nikitas', 'brides', 'deal', 'dividend', 'orders', 'serious professional farm union leaders', 'two new national marine parks', 'South Aegean 1–Southern Cyclades', 'Parliament President Nikitas Kaklamanis', 'two new parks', 'most union leaders', 'old-school political figure', 'twenty fake fields', 'hundred thousand euros', 'relevant Presidential Decrees', 'parliamentary entry threshold', 'red” loan liquidations', 'positive market news', 'Special Environmental Studies', 'Minister Stavros Papastavrou', 'M.M.
