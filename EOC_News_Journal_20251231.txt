Now  anyone who tells you that the government’s handling was correct or even appropriate regarding the farmers’ blockades simply does not want to tell the truth  since life itself proved that things developed badly. Mind you  I am not saying that the government should have satisfied their last demand just so that they would open the roads. Because  given the way things evolved  the majority of these unacceptable types who torment their fellow citizens and damage professionals who were waiting for the holidays to work clearly are not interested in “demands.” Most of those who today… do not listen to a word and do not engage in dialogue are unionist “farmers’ leaders ” anarchic troublemaking youngsters  so-called farmers  or party stooges. Therefore  the M.M. should have ended it one way or another by December 20. Why they did not  there is of course an excuse: that “in the current circumstances  when farmers were late being paid due to OPEKEPE  we did not want to escalate.” But as you understand  there is always (in history) an excuse for everything.What the M.M. is saying nowYesterday there was quite a bit of discussion in the M.M. on this issue. Some said that even now the Authorities must act and impose administrative fines on those who close the emergency lanes  obstruct transport  etc. Others wondered why the Justice system is not moving (there are 200 case files ready for related offenses of obstruction)  but no decision was taken. Mitsotakis  from what I learned  does not want to take the issue to extremes  but the specific farmers who are at the blockades are not interested—as we said—in a solution. Of the 57 blockades  the 18 that wanted to come to dialogue the day before yesterday (mainly from northern Greece) were bullied by the rest and did not remove their tractors from the blockades. I foresee that in the end no solution will be given during the holidays  so the inconvenience will continue and fines will be imposed  as well as prosecutions  the way things are going. I hope it changes.Karystianou’s preparationsThese days  however  the talk of the town at invitations and dinners with a political aroma is whether Maria Karystianou will form a party. Everyone now takes it for granted that she will  while various willing people appear ready to do backstage work. One person  however  is genuinely close: the remarkable Patras politician Nikos Nikolopoulos (for friends NikNik  “oh elder ” the blessing  etc.)  who served as a captain under Karamanlis  then as a Samaras supporter  and later as a friend of Kammenos and SYRIZA  until they fell out and he went his own way. If some are waiting for Karystianou to announce her initiative immediately  they are probably mistaken  as she wants to wait for a year closer to the elections. Also note that a Karystianou party could essentially put the brakes on a Samaras party  who in any case is maintaining a wait-and-see stance and has not made substantial preparations beyond conversations with various friends around Greece. In any case  I asked my (good) polling source where Maria draws votes from. The answer was clear: “Don’t talk to me about votes because Karystianou hasn’t formed a party yet  but her reservoir is from everywhere except ND  and she doesn’t seem to take from PASOK either. However  she takes quite a lot from Tsipras  a lot from Zoe  and from Velopoulos.” This does not surprise me at all  especially when I read that she herself states (Estia) that she will form a party with the goal of the “seizure of assets of corrupt politicians.” This particular “position ” as you understand  sticks everywhere  from the far Left to the far Right—from the “clean hands” operation to Michaloliakos.Close to a Kotsovolos–Amoiridis–Savvidis dealLet me move on to market news  with the column revealing today the latest deal that was “cooked” in 2025 and—barring surprises—will be one of the first we hear about in the new year. According to information  it seems a decision has been made and white smoke will come out regarding Kotsovolos’ acquisition of the company Amoiridis–Savvidis. It is a well-known and reputable company that has been in the market since 1989 and is active in the import and distribution of electrical and electronic appliances. Amoiridis–Savvidis  among other things  is the representative and distributor of Morris  F&U  United  Miyato General  etc. The deal has been in the works for quite some time  but now it seems the time for decisions has arrived. PricewaterhouseCoopers has an active role in the process. Further details  e.g. about the next-day business plan  the column does not know  but if it proceeds  synergies through Kotsovolos will obviously be utilized.The Filippou family put €9.5 million into Hellenic Quality FoodsHellenic Quality Foods of the Filippou family increasingly resembles a bottomless barrel. Not because there is no money  but because new capital keeps going in and still is not enough. Specifically  during 2025  the shareholders reached into their pockets three times to strengthen the cash position: it started with €4 million in February  then another €2 million was needed in September  and now there was another capital injection of €3.5 million. That is a total of €9.5 million in fresh money in less than a year. Thus  the brands KANAKI and MIMIKOS continue to “run ” share capital now stands at €156 million  but the much-desired stabilization is still being sought.Allwyn–OPAP: The positive signal and the €14.8 billion valuationWe are approaching the milestone date for the Allwyn–OPAP deal  and ahead of the general meeting on 7/1 where shareholders will be asked to ratify the merger of the two companies  investors and analysts are taking positions on the prospects of the next day. Citi estimated the combined valuation of the scheme at €14.8 billion  which means that under current conditions it will be the second-largest listed company (behind Coca-Cola at €16 billion) on Euronext Athens. According to Citi’s projections  adjusted EBITDA is expected to approach €2 billion in 2026  recording annual growth of around 32%. A decisive role in this dynamic is played by the contribution of PrizePicks  which is estimated to strengthen the group’s figures by about €270 million. At the same time  the decision to cancel the issuance of preferred shares with enhanced rights continues to be positively valued by investment houses in the first reports published after the relevant announcement. Citi notes that the preferred shares were a key point of concern for investors and that their withdrawal significantly increases the chances of approval of the agreement. In the same vein  brokerages such as Eurobank Equities and Piraeus Securities point out that the modification removes key obstacles to the deal  reduces complexity  and enhances visibility of completion. Similarly  NBG Securities emphasizes that the Allwyn economic stake remains unchanged at 78.5%  with no impact on valuation. Alpha Finance  Pantelakis Securities  and Beta Securities also take a positive stance  underscoring that the new structure eliminates asymmetries in rights and control  reduces governance risk  and strengthens the confidence of the investment community.Bulgaria  Greece and… the euroCelebrations for Bulgaria’s accession to the euro have begun  and the European Central Bank will grandly welcome Bulgaria  which from 1/1/2026 replaces the lev with the euro. Thus  from tomorrow  December 31  until January 11  the ECB’s main building will be illuminated every evening from 17:30 to celebrate Bulgaria’s entry into the euro area. The country will become the 21st member of the eurozone. The previous accession was Croatia  which adopted the euro on January 1  2023  becoming the 20th member of the euro area. For Greece  Bulgaria’s accession is of particular importance  as the two countries are closely connected economically and business-wise. According to data from the Bulgarian National Bank  Greece ranks third in net inflows of foreign direct investment into Bulgaria in the first quarter of 2025  with a total value of €115.2 million  behind only the Netherlands (€190.3 million) and Austria (€127.2 million). The total stock of Greek investments in Bulgaria amounts to approximately €4.415 billion. More than 18 000 Greek companies operate in the country  with total investments of around 6 billion leva (approximately €3 billion)  which have created over 60 000 jobs. Greek investments in Bulgaria have increased impressively by about 466% in recent years  strengthening the close economic connection between the two countries. In the banking sector  Eurobank remains the main Greek player in the country through its subsidiary Eurobank Bulgaria AD  operating under the Postbank brand. The bank is one of the largest in the country  with a wide presence in both retail and corporate banking.At COSCO they are getting nervous – traffic is fallingThe decline in container handling at Piers II and III of PCT in Piraeus is not being treated merely as a collateral loss of the Red Sea situation. COSCO Shipping Ports’ data for the period January–November 2025—3 645 900 TEUs versus 3 861 700 last year  a drop of 5.6%—have already rung alarm bells for financial analysts and port-industry executives  who see that the narrative of a temporary dip is starting to become troubling. In the corridors  however  everyone whispers about a more specific reason: MSC’s decision to withdraw the mothership that was calling at Piraeus and send it to a Turkish port. A purely operational move  insiders say  but with a clear imprint on the numbers. “When you lose a mothership  you don’t just lose TEUs ” comments a port official with experience in Mediterranean hubs  implying that Turkey is gaining points as an alternative hub. Financial analysts point out that when COSCO’s competitors in the Western Mediterranean are posting growth  the problem is not only geopolitical. And indeed  the Spanish ports of Valencia and Bilbao ran at +12.6% in November  Antwerp and Rotterdam are rising  and overall COSCO’s terminals outside China are closing the eleven-month period at +10.7%. The message is clear: trade flows are shifting westward  where liner companies find stability  market depth  and fewer risks. At COSCO  however  they are keeping a low profile and betting on the return of routes through Suez in 2026. At the political-insider level  though  the question remains: if MSC and other major players get used to elsewhere  how easily does Piraeus return to their radar?Egnatia opens the road for Elefsina and 22 airportsToday the financial transaction is being completed for Egnatia Odos to pass to the consortium GEK TERNA (75%) – Egis Projects (25%) for the next 35 years. Today’s signing opens the way for the next moves of the Hellenic Asset Development Fund  which has already proceeded with hiring advisors for the concession of the 22 regional airports and is expected in the first months of 2026 to present the final model for their utilization. The package includes the airports of Naxos  Paros  Ioannina  Alexandroupoli  Lemnos  Araxos  Syros  Milos  Chios  Kozani  Kastoria  and others. Information indicates that Fraport will be the first to appear as a bidder for a new concession. At the same time  large logistics parks are entering a development trajectory. The pivotal project is the port of Elefsina  which has firmly entered the American radar as a counterbalance to the “Chinese” Piraeus. The tender announcement by the Hellenic Asset Development Fund for the Elefsina Port Authority is expected in 2026  with the U.S. development bank DFC and the ONEX Group openly expressing their interest. The plan provides for the creation of a new port of 400 acres  with rail access  which will function as a commercial  energy  and transshipment hub of strategic importance. For the U.S. government  Elefsina constitutes a critical link in the architecture of energy and defense security in the Eastern Mediterranean  especially if there is a connection to the Thriasio Freight Center and LNG corridors. Privatizations with a strong geopolitical footprint.A “royal” landingNot one  not two  but four new companies were set up yesterday by the Vasilias family. This is the family of Loukas Vasilias  who was active in the automobile market—he had also served as president of the Association of Automobile Dealers in the past—but later moved from cars to… real estate  which is obviously far more profitable. According to information  he holds a large real estate portfolio in the southern suburbs (Alimos  Palaio Faliro  Keratsini  Piraeus  etc.). Yesterday  therefore  four companies were established with his children as shareholders  all based in Alimos  with purposes including holding-company activities  working-capital (liquidity) management consulting  as well as services for the exploitation and management of assets of legal entities. Specifically  KLV Holdings S.A. with initial share capital of €7 470 000  divided into 747 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €10 each. Here  Kreon Vasilias paid €11 413.88 in cash and received 1 141 corporate units  while contributing in kind shares and participations with a total value appraised at €7 458 586.12  corresponding to 745 859 corporate units. Dimilucia Holdings has initial capital of €4 400 000  divided into 440 000 corporate units of capital contributions with a nominal value of €10 each  and Dimitra Vasilias paid €13 823 in cash and received 1 382 corporate units  while contributing in kind shares and participations with a total value appraised at €4 386 177  corresponding to 438 618 corporate units. The management of the company was assigned to Fani Vasilias. She herself proceeded with the establishment of Holon Holdings  with capital of €4 400 000 divided into 440 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €10 each. Fani Vasilias paid €11 855.31 in cash and received 1 186 corporate units  while contributing in kind shares and participations with a total value appraised at €4 388 144.69  corresponding to 438 814 corporate units. In addition  CVL Holdings was established  with capital of €7 320 000 divided into 732 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €10 each. Chrysanthi Vasilias paid €8 534.25 in cash and received 853 corporate units  while contributing in kind shares and participations with a total value appraised at €7 311 465.75  corresponding to 731 147 corporate units. Let me remind you that last March Loukas Vasilias—who is a football supporter of the yellow-and-black colors and in the past had shown interest in acquiring a majority stake in AEK FC—had established the company Southern Riviera Properties with share capital of €500 000  with the purpose of leasing and managing owned real estate  while a few months earlier he had opened another eight companies for the exploitation of real estate assets. We are talking about a… royal landing…When the Wall Street ticker disagrees with Net Asset ValueOn Wall Street  big stories often begin when the market “sees” less than what the assets are worth. The listed Imperial Petroleum of Harry Vafias is such a case. With a market capitalization of about $171 million on Nasdaq and an estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) of over $508 million  the stock is priced at roughly one third of its net value. The recent $60 million capital increase via Maxim triggered a sharp correction  proving that the market fears dilution. At the same time  however  the Greek shipowner maintains 30% of the common shares and has not sold a single one. In the language of Wall Street  this translates into confidence in the narrative. The NAV is based on a fleet of tankers and bulkers  participations and cash  without including seven vessels under acquisition. With new capital in the treasury and a strategy of radio silence regarding upcoming purchases  Imperial is playing the long game. The question is not whether the stock is cheap  but when the market will admit it.The silent advance of Peter GFor those who follow shipping  the latest moves by Peter G carry a clear message: he is present  he moves fast  and he is taking up space. The acquisition of Norvic’s dry bulk segment by United Overseas Trading was interpreted not as a simple commercial transaction  but as a move of control. Peter G did not simply buy contracts and vessels. He acquired a team  know-how  and a ready-made machine that works from day one. In a market where many are still searching for direction  this counts more than the price  which in any case was not announced. Norvic had for some time been moving out of the dry bulk picture: fewer deals  desk closures  departures. The exit was only a matter of time. Peter G entered at the right moment  without noise  without leaks  and took whatever had value. A classic move by a player who knows how to wait. At the same time  P.G.’s $230 million SPAC in New York shows the other face of the same strategy. Public money  an international audience  and freedom of choice for the next two years. Officially it is not connected to Norvic. In practice  however  it shows that Peter G wants to have both private tools and public ammunition.Rendezvous in ParisPiraeus Securities is preparing its own roadshow with many companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange  in Paris. The dates 30–31 January 2026 have been locked in  and the first participants include FTSE 25 companies with an emphasis on the industrial sector  such as Motor Oil and Athens International Airport. This roadshow comes at a time when international houses (JP Morgan  UBS  Bank of America  Goldman Sachs) are placing Greek stocks high—once again—for 2026  with particular emphasis on banks  energy  and industrial shares. Despite five consecutive years of gains  the Greek narrative remains positive in international markets.TITAN carries heavy weight on its shouldersThe TITAN giant of the Athens Stock Exchange comfortably surpassed a market capitalization of €4 billion  with the share price at €52.3  that is  +42% higher than the stock price three months ago. The density of trading and the steady upward movement of the share are attributed—among other things—to the apparent intention of the parent company to proceed with a placement of shares of its American subsidiary. The information has not been confirmed so far by management; however  a few days ago Pantelakis Securities hastened to inform its clients that it is raising the target price for Titan’s share to €59 from €51.5 previously. The management of the TITAN Group is  for the time being  limiting itself to reminding the market that the sales target has been raised to €4 billion by 2029  with a promise of operating profits of around €1 billion by 2029. Pantelakis Securities  for its part  estimates that TITAN’s operating profits will record an average annual increase of +8% through 2029  discreetly reminding that the Group has “firepower” of approximately €1 billion  which can be used for acquisitions. Finally  it considers unjustified TITAN’s discount of 37% and 51% compared to its European and American peers.The block trades of Real ConsultingApproximately 1.5% of the share capital of Real Consulting changed hands in yesterday’s session of the Athens Stock Exchange through pre-arranged transactions  at prices ranging from €5.04 to €5.08. The moves indicate a careful reshuffling of investment positions  without any sign of an exit by a strategic investor. The block prices at €5–5.08 are slightly below the revised target price of Eurobank Equities at €6.2  announced last week. The brokerage revalued the stock after the summer acquisition of Romania’s Smart UX Development  which expanded the company’s activities in the utilities sector and added critical SAP S/4HANA capabilities. Real Consulting closes 2025 with strategic capital in its coffers. Analysts estimate net cash of more than €7 million. At the same time  management tied down its top executives with an incentive program  as in October it distributed 367 671 shares free of charge to 56 employees  worth €1.87 million.TREK Development now has 400 shareholdersOn November 17  TREK Development began its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. At that time it had 55 shareholders. Today  shareholders have exceeded 400  while yesterday the Chairman and CEO Konstantinos Papapolyzos and his wife  Vice Chairwoman Melina Lazaropoulou  sold 375 000 shares (4.7% of the share capital)  with a total value of €937 500  with the aim of expanding the company’s free float  as they had committed at the time of listing. Immediately after the transaction  the share jumped to limit up and TREK Development’s market capitalization exceeded €25.2 million  that is  108.46% higher than its listing price.Banks failed to move the ASE away from March 2010 levelsThe first session of the Athens Stock Exchange after the short holiday break—it had been closed since December 23—provided a good opportunity for the few traders to absorb part of the strong annual gains. Banking stocks were in the spotlight—with the exception of CrediaBank—as well as certain titles that showed signs of fatigue after successive breakouts  such as Motor Oil and the shares of the Viohalco group. However  Metlen—which until recently had been underperforming—picked up speed  to some extent countering the “wave” of selling and keeping Athens close to March 2010 levels. Some other blue chips also accelerated  such as GEK TERNA  Aktor  and EYDAP  which approached their yearly highs. In mid-cap stocks  AVAX stood out  now just a breath away from €3 for the first time since December 2009. Papoutsanis recorded a “jump” of 15% yesterday  setting course for its 18-year highs of €4. At exactly the same price as Papoutsanis (€3.88)  Evrofarma closed  marking a new record of approximately 24 years (February 2002).The scandal all of America is talking about todayOne day after Christmas  a young (23-year-old) independent journalist named Nick Shirley published a 42-minute investigation which  according to him  reveals “the largest fraud scandal in U.S. history.” Within one day  his investigation exceeded 100 million views on X and 1 million views on YouTube  surpassing in reach the country’s largest news agencies and newspapers. The journalist searched for and found “suspicious” social service businesses in Minnesota  mainly daycare centers operated by members of the Somali community. These businesses receive state funds for childcare programs under Minnesota’s Medicaid program. Shirley found empty buildings without children during “working hours ” stands in front of a “Quality Learning” daycare center whose owner cannot correctly spell the word “learning ” yet has received $4 million in state funds. The Justice system reacted immediately  with Assistant Attorney Joe Thompson stating that he suspects the scale of fraud in Minnesota’s Medicaid program may have reached $9 billion  slightly less than Somalia’s total GDP.
