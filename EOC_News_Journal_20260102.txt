Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesBut it is still not clear whether Trump – who bragged about being able to end the war in one day and talks up the moneymaking potential of a rapprochement with Russia – now accepts that any deal must satisfy Kyiv and Europe  or believes that only he and Putin will ultimately decide the fate of Ukraine and European security.His long-standing admiration for Putin and other autocrats  his eagerness to repair US-Russia relations  his reluctance to put pressure on Moscow and his habit of blaming Ukraine and its president  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  for hampering peace efforts  make Ukrainians deeply distrustful of Washington.Yet they also know their country still relies on the US for crucial components of its war effort.For all Ukraine’s progress in producing drones – which have hit military and industrial targets well more than 1 000km inside Russia – there is no substitute for top-line US air defence systems or for the intelligence that spy satellites and other US resources can provide.Nato members in Europe are now buying billions of dollars of US weapons for Kyiv  but there is no guarantee Trump will not suddenly halt deliveries  cancel intelligence sharing or interfere with the Starlink satellite internet service that their army relies upon  if he wants to put yet more pressure on Zelenskiy to sign a deal.Privately  senior EU sources recognise any decision by Washington to cut off the flow of US intelligence would be devastating and severely undermine Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.Ukraine’s relations with the US are fractious and unpredictable at a time when it needs maximum support from its allies on the battlefield  as well as at the negotiating table.Volodymyr Zelenskiy  Ukraine's president  and US president Donald Trump during a fractious meeting at the White House in February: Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/BloombergRussia has lost about a million soldiers to death and injury since 2022  according to western intelligence  but its offers of high pay  big signing-on bonuses and other financial incentives are still attracting an estimated 30 000 recruits every month.With plentiful supplies from Russia’s vast arms industry  its allies Iran and North Korea and so-called dual-use items from China  Moscow’s invasion force continues to grind forward along several stretches of the 1 200km front line in eastern Ukraine.The small city of Pokrovsk and the town of Siversk in Donetsk region may fall to Russia in the coming weeks  opening routes towards Kramatorsk and Slovyansk  larger cities that are home to most of the 250 000 or so civilians who still live in Kyiv-run parts of the province. Ukraine’s weary  outnumbered and badly stretched forces also face continuing battles in parts of Kharkiv  Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions.Putin has vowed to take all of Donetsk through force or Ukraine’s withdrawal  and the Kremlin bristled at reports that revised US proposals foresee the area around Slovyansk and Kramatorsk becoming a demilitarised “free economic zone” rather than Russian land.Sources who have been directly briefed by Zelenskiy on the ongoing negotiations say the Ukrainian leader is likely angling for the creation of some type of demilitarised zone in the talks.Yet Kyiv says it cannot simply hand over heavily fortified territory that would make swathes of northern and central Ukraine vulnerable to future Russian attack  especially in the absence of ironclad security guarantees from the West and peacekeepers on the ground.[ ‘Ukraine’s most successful battlefield’: Black Sea wins keep Odesa port open for businessOpens in new window ]Moscow says it will never accept western troops in Ukraine  just as it will never allow its neighbour to join Nato. And the Kremlin insists Russia and the US will decide on all these issues – through talks that should remain secret – treating Ukraine as a western puppet state and Europe as a hindrance that Trump will ultimately ignore.Putin’s regime is still confident it can get what it wants from Trump because  even though Kyiv and other European capitals appear to have partly reshaped US peace proposals  the US leader remains unchanged.He is still vain and capricious  impatient for a deal and the riches he thinks will flow from access to Russia’s natural resources and other economic opportunities.He is also disdainful of the mainstream  liberal Europe that backs Kyiv  and what he seems to regard – egged on by Russia – as the obstacles that Zelenskiy and European leaders keep putting in the way of “more winning” for the self-styled “president of peace”.The site of a bombing in Sloviansk  Ukraine  in February 2024. Photograph: Tyler Hicks/New York TimesBut what Trump treats as petty problems are in fact the fundamental elements of a potential deal  which could decide whether Europe’s biggest war since 1945 really ends  resumes after a pause or keeps rumbling on.How will the West ensure Russia never attacks Ukraine again? What will be the status of occupied territory? What will become of Kyiv-controlled parts of Donetsk region and its residents? How will any peace deal be secured and monitored?Who will run the Russian-occupied nuclear power station sitting on the front line in Zaporizhzhia? Who will pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine  which the United Nations and World Bank said earlier this year would cost more than $500 billion (€427 billion)?Who will answer for the well-documented war crimes committed by Russia’s invasion force? And what of the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for senior Russian officials who ordered attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine  and for Putin himself over the abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children?[ From city hall to house arrest: fall of Odesa’s mayor exposes Ukraine power strugglesOpens in new window ]Russia is banking on Trump to simply make uncomfortable questions disappear  and facilitate its near pain-free reintegration into the world economy.Through state media  Putin is sending the same message to Russians: total victory is inevitable  either on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. There is no sense of a nation being prepared to moderate maximalist expectations whipped up by the Kremlin.Polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed this week that 72 per cent of Ukrainians were ready for a deal that included some compromises and froze the front line – but 75 per cent saw as “completely unacceptable” any plan that gave land to Russia or limited Ukraine’s army without including strong security guarantees.Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen  European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen at the end of the EU Council Summit in Brussels on December 19th. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAOne of the big question marks that hung over 2025 was whether Kyiv’s allies in Europe would be able to fill the shortfall opened up when the Trump administration curtailed financial and military aid to Ukraine. The US is still sending weapons and equipment  but now on the condition someone pays for them.The leaders of the EU’s 27 member states gave a definitive answer in the early hours of December 19th  emerging from a Brussels summit having agreed on a €90 billion loan for Ukraine.The EU will borrow money as a bloc  backed against its €1.2 trillion budget  rolling over the debt for years  similar to the way governments do. Ukraine would only pay back the money if Russia paid reparations for the destruction its invasion had caused.The loan represents a significant departure for the EU. Berlin and other fiscally conservative capitals have long opposed the union taking on joint debt  but previously made an exception for a recovery fund in the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.The departure seemed extremely unlikely just three weeks before  when ambassadors from each member state met in the Europa building  where their prime ministers and presidents would later gather for the key summit.The 27 largely unknown senior officials are an important axle in the European policymaking machine  bridging the Brussels-based institutions and national governments.A Ukrainian artillery crew fires an M777 howitzer at Russian targets at the Kurakhove front line in eastern Ukraine in February. Photograph:Tyler Hicks/New York TimesTwo options were put on the table by the European Commission  the union’s powerful executive led by Ursula von der Leyen.A €90 billion loan could be funded by joint borrowing  or instead be backed by Russian central bank assets frozen inside EU financial institutions by sanctions introduced in the early weeks of the war.The commission predicted Ukraine would begin to run out of money in the second half of 2026  risking a possible collapse on the battlefield.The Hungarian ambassador representing Viktor Orban’s far-right government made it clear they would not go for an EU loan.Given that option would require the sign-off of all national capitals  it seemed to die in the room.The plan to use Russia’s frozen assets only required a weighted majority to be approved  so that’s where EU officials focused their energy.[ ‘We live with danger’: Ukrainian farmers risk deadly harvest in fields sown with bombsOpens in new window ]The Belgian government feared it would be exposed to Russian retaliation  given most of the assets were on ice in Euroclear  a Belgian depository housing government bonds. The commission and German chancellor Friedrich Merz – a big backer of the plan to tap the Russian state cash – failed to convince the Belgians.In the days before EU leaders met in Brussels  a small circle of officials and diplomats started to consider what to do in the event Belgium’s prime minister Bart De Wever could not be persuaded to lift his opposition. The other leaders would not push ahead over the objections of Belgium.A back channel was opened up to Budapest  sounding out Orban again on the idea of an EU-backed loan.A workaround was constructed  relying on emergency powers laid out in the union’s treaties  that meant Hungary would be exempt from covering any costs associated with the loan.Orban told fellow EU leaders he would not veto the plan  once Hungary wasn’t on the hook in any way.Populist governments in Slovakia and Czech Republic  who are also lukewarm on the idea of aiding Ukraine  joined Hungary.The result was a 3am deal that will go a long way to shoring up Ukraine’s finances for the next two years. The EU loan puts Kyiv in a more secure position in the twisting negotiations the US has been running  to broker a deal between Russia and Ukraine.Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban. Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty ImagesIn private discussions  some European leaders doubt Putin has any serious intention of supporting a peace deal where Moscow would agree to make concessions.Europe’s strategy  which has stayed the same since Trump’s summit with the Russian leader in Alaska  has been to convince the White House that Moscow is the real obstacle to a truce  and that Putin will only compromise when put under serious pressure.Jamie Shea  a former senior Nato official  said one of the worst scenarios would be an unstable truce that hamstrung Ukraine and allowed Russia to regroup and plot a further attack. “The Russian army will still be in good shape and reconstitute quickly ” he said.[ How Russia recruits Ukrainians to attack their own countryOpens in new window ]A freeze in the conflict could look similar to a 2014 deal intended to end the fighting in the Donbas between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist forces  which did not hold  he said.For any truce to be successful it would need to create the conditions “for a 30-year stalemate” in the east  he said  before pointing to Cyprus and East Germany during the Cold War as two examples.Shea  who served as Nato’s deputy assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges  told The Irish Times the problem was western support for Ukraine had given Kyiv “enough to not lose  but not enough to win”.“Ukraine is still in the fight and no one would have predicted that four years ago ” he said. However  the “Russian steamroller” is inching forward.“For the Europeans  if they want Ukraine to keep fighting  in the interests of a solution that’s in line with justice and European values ... they will have to  in terms of financial support  do a hell of a lot more ” he said.,neutral,0.0,0.74,0.25,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Ukraine', 'fight', 'one', 'Kyiv', 'initial 28-point draft peace plan', 'top-line US air defence systems', 'Starlink satellite internet service', 'demilitarised “free economic zone', 'several big European states', 'Russian president Vladimir Putin', 'Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg', 'a million soldiers', 'vast arms industry', '1,200km front line', 'US president Donald Trump', 'future Russian attack', 'other financial incentives', 'ironclad security guarantees', 'western puppet state', 'latest Russian attacks', 'senior EU sources', 'other US resources', 'demilitarised zone', 'peace efforts', 'European security', 'big signing', 'several stretches', 'Russian envoys', 'Russian land', 'European leaders', 'latest pronouncements', 'other regions', 'European Union', 'other autocrats', 'western troops', 'US weapons', 'US proposals', 'western intelligence', 'little attention', 'fantastical boasts', 'jawed threats', 'earnest pledges', 'air-raid alerts', 'world news', 'combined efforts', 'main demands', 'Andrew Harnik', 'Getty Images', 'one day', 'moneymaking potential', 'standing admiration', 'crucial components', 'industrial targets', 'spy satellites', 'maximum support', 'negotiating table', 'fractious meeting', 'White House', 'high pay', 'plentiful supplies', 'North Korea', 'dual-use items', 'small city', 'coming weeks', 'larger cities', 'continuing battles', 'Dnipropetrovsk regions', 'ongoing negotiations', 'Ukrainian leader', 'fortified territory', 'Black Sea', 'Odesa port', 'new window', 'US intelligence', 'intelligence sharing', 'US-Russia relations', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'war effort', 'Nato members', 'invasion force', 'Donetsk region', 'Kyiv-run parts', 'successful battlefield', 'most Ukrainians', 'eastern Ukraine', 'central Ukraine', 'headlines', 'country', 'relevance', 'night', 'light', 'heat', 'water', 'military', 'momentum', 'Moscow', 'Alaska', 'August', 'Photograph', 'rapprochement', 'deal', 'fate', 'long', 'eagerness', 'reluctance', 'pressure', 'habit', 'Washington', 'progress', 'drones', '1,000km', 'substitute', 'billions', 'dollars', 'deliveries', 'army', 'decision', 'flow', 'ability', 'time', 'allies', 'February', 'death', 'injury', 'offers', 'bonuses', '30,000 recruits', 'Iran', 'China', 'Pokrovsk', 'town', 'Siversk', 'routes', 'Kramatorsk', 'Slovyansk', 'civilians', 'province', 'forces', 'Kharkiv', 'Sumy', 'withdrawal', 'Kremlin', 'reports', 'area', 'creation', 'type', 'talks', 'heavily', 'swathes', 'northern', 'absence', 'peacekeepers', 'ground', 'businessOpens', 'neighbour', 'issues', 'hindrance', 'regime', '250,000']",2026-01-01,2026-01-02,irishtimes.com

This included co-founder and CEO Keith McGrane stepping down in November 2024  and chairman Frank Allen’s departure from the company.Another co-founder  Darren Patrick Green  stood down as president and executive director after unrelated companies he was involved in were named in relation to a UK tax probe.Corre Energy had been focused on the development  construction and eventual operation of grid-scale underground renewable storage facilities as well as the production of green hydrogen.In July 2024  it had announced what it described as “one of Europe’s largest battery projects” that was to be part of a €300m scheme to store up to 640MWh in batteries in the Netherlands as part of a joint partnership with the Dutch battery storage firm SemperPower.However  by December of that year  the company said that it had sold its 50pc stake in the joint venture for €4m  describing the sale as an “important milestone” following a restructuring undertaken in September.The company had also touted what it described as its flagship compressed-air energy storage project  known as ZW1 in the north east of the Netherlands  which was designed to serve as a storage platform for offshore windfarms.Corre Energy also claimed to be the consortium lead  alongside Eurowind Energy and Gas Storage Denmark  in the development of the Green Hydrogen Hub Denmark project  which aimed to combine large-scale hydrogen production and storage in Denmark.Storage is an important part of developing renewable energy into more dependable  long-term power sources  with wind and sunshine often at variance with grid requirements.In July of last year  Corre Energy agreed a debt repayment plan aimed at reducing a tax bill of over €1m owed to the UK Revenue.However  the firm’s bankruptcy and liquidation means that it will not be able to discharge any further debts.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['renewable energy firm', 'Liquidator', 'Corre', 'grid-scale underground renewable storage facilities', 'flagship compressed-air energy storage project', 'Green Hydrogen Hub Denmark project', 'dependable, long-term power sources', 'troubled renewable energy firm', 'Dutch battery storage firm', 'largest battery projects', 'Darren Patrick Green', 'CEO Keith McGrane', 'chairman Frank Allen', 'debt repayment plan', 'large-scale hydrogen production', 'UK tax probe', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'Dutch city', 'storage platform', 'Gas Storage', 'Corre Energy', 'Eurowind Energy', 'tax bill', 'UK Revenue', 'latest stage', 'two years', 'executive departures', 'executive director', 'unrelated companies', 'eventual operation', '€300m scheme', 'to 640MWh', 'joint partnership', '50pc stake', 'joint venture', 'important milestone', 'north east', 'offshore windfarms', 'consortium lead', 'grid requirements', 'last year', 'important part', 'Dublin', 'liquidator', 'Ireland', 'move', 'fortunes', 'company', 'Netherlands', 'October', 'Groningen', 'funding', 'listing', 'series', 'founder', 'November', 'president', 'relation', 'development', 'construction', 'July', 'Europe', 'batteries', 'SemperPower', 'December', 'sale', 'restructuring', 'September', 'ZW1', 'sunshine', 'variance', 'bankruptcy', 'liquidation', 'debts']",2026-01-01,2026-01-02,independent.ie
