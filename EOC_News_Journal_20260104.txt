Photograph: Daniel Roland/AFP/GettyOTC Markets Group  a US stock trading venue  says more Irish companies should follow the likes of AIB  Cairn Homes and Greencore in using its platform to court US investors without having to go down the route of seeking a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.“Some of the largest global brands and corporations use us as their entrée into the US without the cost  complexity and risk” of being regulated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission  Jason Paltrowitz  executive vice-president of corporate services  said in a recent interview with The Irish Times.He said the benefit for the home markets  where the stocks have their actual listing  is that trades are ultimately reported there  boosting local liquidity. The list of Irish companies that have opted to have their shares quoted on the market also includes FBD  Glenveagh Homes  DCC and C&C.OTC offers trading in more than 200 European companies.While Mr Paltrowitz conceded that  primarily  US listing opens up the prospects of a company joining a key Wall Street index  he said mid-sized European companies have no chance of joining the S&P 500  the world’s most widely followed stocks index.“The S&P 500 is only for the largest companies. If you are an ordinary Irish company being courted by investment banks about the benefits of a US listing  but are not eligible for the S&P 500  you are not going to see any real upside ” he said.Mr Paltrowitz said non-US companies with market valuations of less than $1 billion (€850 million) often “essentially become orphan companies that are not traded a lot”.The lack of investor interest is often compounded as companies that dump their home listing are also typically dropped by local analysts  he added.“We hear from companies all of the time that have been enticed by US bankers to list in New York with pitches like  ‘It’s going be great. We’re going to raise a lot of money for you. Your CEO will have their photo in Times Square’ ” said Mr Paltrowitz. “And after the transaction and the bankers have pocketed their fees  the companies find themselves running around in circles trying to maintain – and justify – that listing.”OTC  which traces its roots back to 1913  has collaboration agreements with the Canadian Securities Exchange and Aquis Exchange in London  which is aimed at small companies  and recently struck a partnership deal with Deutsche Börse  which runs the Frankfurt exchange  to encourage the companies listed on their markets to tap US investors without opting for a full dual listing on Wall Street.[ Greencore on track for €1.4bn Bakkavor deal as Bristol site sale appeases watchdogOpens in new window ]OTC is also in talks with Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group AG for a similar agreement  and has a data distribution deal with the London Stock Exchange.However  it has yet to convince Euronext  which runs the Irish market  of the merits of an alliance – even as it has lost a number of large primary listings to Wall Street in recent years.These include Irish corporate giants CRH  Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Westrock  formerly known as Smurfit Kappa.Mr Paltrowitz said a formal alliance with Euronext – which runs six primary European exchanges  including Dublin  Paris and Amsterdam – would give the exchange operator a way to reassure European companies concerned that listing locally might limit access to well-funded US investors.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.43,0.12,0.45,True,English,"['OTC Markets', 'Irish companies', 'New York', 'alternative', 'six primary European exchanges', 'Swiss stock exchange operator', 'US stock trading venue', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'key Wall Street index', 'SIX Group AG', 'large primary listings', 'largest global brands', 'Deutsche Börse', '€1.4bn Bakkavor deal', 'data distribution deal', 'German stock market', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Canadian Securities Exchange', 'The Irish Times', 'Irish corporate giants', 'full dual listing', 'The S&P 500', 'ordinary Irish company', 'mid-sized European companies', 'OTC Markets Group', 'full listing', 'Exchange Commission', 'Aquis Exchange', 'new window', 'US Securities', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'partnership deal', 'corporate services', 'stocks index', 'Times Square', '200 European companies', 'Irish market', 'Frankfurt exchange', 'US listing', 'Irish companies', 'largest companies', 'actual listing', 'US investors', 'Daniel Roland', 'Cairn Homes', 'entrée', 'Jason Paltrowitz', 'executive vice-president', 'recent interview', 'local liquidity', 'Glenveagh Homes', 'C&C.', 'Mr Paltrowitz', 'investment banks', 'real upside', 'investor interest', 'local analysts', 'collaboration agreements', 'Bristol site', 'similar agreement', 'recent years', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'market valuations', 'home listing', 'orphan companies', 'small companies', 'home markets', 'US bankers', 'formal alliance', 'Photograph', 'AFP/Getty', 'likes', 'AIB', 'Greencore', 'platform', 'route', 'Nasdaq', 'corporations', 'cost', 'complexity', 'risk', 'benefit', 'trades', 'shares', 'FBD', 'DCC', 'prospects', 'chance', 'world', 'less', 'lack', 'pitches', 'lot', 'money', 'CEO', 'transaction', 'fees', 'circles', 'roots', 'track', 'watchdogOpens', 'talks', 'Euronext', 'merits', 'number', 'CRH', 'Dublin', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'way', 'access', 'funded']",2026-01-03,2026-01-04,irishtimes.com
