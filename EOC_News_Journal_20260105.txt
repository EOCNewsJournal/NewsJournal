Photo: GettyThe spectre of asset bubbles  geopolitical policy shocks and elections in the US are among the key trends investment analysts will closely monitor in 2026 as the artificial intelligence investment boom continues to gather pace.With global economic headwinds persisting  the focus in the year ahead will be on how AI optimism  trade frictions and evolving political risks define opportunities for Irish investors at home and abroad.The Sunday Independent asked analysts from Irish stockbrokers Davy and Goodbody  wealth management firm Fordel  and UK-based investment bank Barclays  about their predictions for 2026.The huge boom in artificial intelligence investments was a dominant investment theme heading into the year.Most analysts agreed AI would continue to be a huge feature with potentially huge upsides.'A market sell-off is likely to be focused on those areas of the market that are over-valued.' And Bitcoin is an example  said one analyst. Photo: Getty“We expect AI to be the most important macro factor in 2026  as traditional drivers such as monetary policy and trade policy fade ” said Emmanuel Cau  head of European equity strategy at Barclays Investment Bank.“The focus is increasingly shifting from pure technology builders toward companies enabling and adopting AI at scale.”There are real fears of a potential AI bubble  with tech firms valuations soaring in value.Any subsequent correction to those valuations  if profits fail to materialise  could result in swingeing losses for investors.Most analysts agreed fears of a bubble were overblown  but being cautious was key.Cau believes the concerns over an AI-led correction are “overdone”.“We expect the expansion to continue into 2026 ” he said. “Earnings should make a comeback as the primary driver of returns for European markets in 2026.”Oliver Moloney  chief investment officer with Fordel  said investors should be careful with areas of the market that have become very expensive or heavily concentrated  particularly some individual technology and AI-related stocks.“While we don’t believe the overall market is in a bubble  sharp pullbacks are always possible ” he said.'We also believe 2026 should be a good year for AIB  Cairn Homes and Ryanair.' Pictured  Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary“A market sell-off is likely to be focused on those areas of the market that are over-valued. We have already seen this play out somewhat in the second half of 2025.“A good example is Bitcoin  in our view a risk sentiment barometer  which fell by 32pc between October 6 and November 21.""Oracle is another good example of an individual AI name that fell by 42pc at its worst in the second half of 2025.”Dudley Shanley  head of research at Goodbody  believes the big focus for global equity markets in 2026 is AI and whether or not the technology has resulted in a bubble in the equity markets.Shanley has his doubts.“Unlike the dot-com bubble  the so-called AI hyperscalers such as Amazon  Google  Meta and Microsoft are all generating both profits and cash flow to fund their AI investments ” he said.“There is no doubt that some of this investment will not deliver the returns expected in the short term  but putting it all together  we believe it is too early to call the bursting of an AI-related bubble.”Shanley believes an Irish-listed firm could benefit from AI. There are market trends set to boost others too.“From an Irish equity market perspective  there are few companies that offer a play on the AI theme  with Kingspan being the clear outlier given its leading capabilities in data centre construction.“Outside of Kingspan  the more muted global consumer and the more challenging UK macro environment have a disproportionate impact on many of the listed Irish companies ” he added.“As such  we look to names that have significant domestic exposure  clear operational moats  and self-help opportunities. In that context  we also believe 2026 should be a good year for AIB  Cairn Homes and Ryanair.”'Areas such as defence  energy and infrastructure could benefit from policy priorities'. Photo: GettyAside from AI  what else are the experts keeping an eye on?Trump’s trade tariffs were expected to pose significant challenges for European firms over the last year.So far  many of the predictions of doom and gloom have yet to materialise.Barclays’ Cau said the market reaction suggested some of the worst fears were overblown.“Policy uncertainty remains a source of volatility  particularly around tariffs and industrial policy ” he said.“However  markets have turned the page on tariffs  reacting less to each headline  suggesting some adjustment has already occurred.“Macro and geopolitical tail risks still abound  however  with politics continuing to influence sentiment and valuations.”Fordel’s Moloney agreed the markets have shown they can “look through political noise when economic conditions are stable”.However  with US mid-term elections coming up – and two wars ongoing – politics and geopolitics will likely be the forces that bring about volatility.“Areas such as defence  energy and infrastructure could benefit from policy priorities  while sectors that rely heavily on global trade may face more uncertainty ” Moloney said.The mid-term elections in the US are also set to have ramifications far beyond the States.Aidan Donnelly  head of global equities at Davy  said Trump’s approach to the elections carries risk for the markets.“The mid-term elections happen in November  and while Trump will want to let the economy run hot into these  in the hope that the Republicans can avoid defeat in one or both Houses of Congress  the risk will be if the bond market takes fright and we see yields moving higher.“This would have a knock-on effect to investor sentiment in the stock market  but also to consumer sentiment in the economy.”Looking ahead to 2026  Diarmaid Sheridan  head of research at Davy  believes the fundamentals for Irish-listed businesses remained supportive.He noted the Irish Stock Exchange was up around 30pc this year.Cau is also optimistic about European and Irish businesses“Key sectors such as housebuilding are expected to benefit from sustained demand and recent government initiatives aimed at addressing housing supply ” he said.“Airlines  notably Ryanair  continue to pursue an ambitious growth trajectory  while the banking sector is well positioned to maintain solid performance into next year.”Cau is also optimistic about European and Irish businesses.“There are several companies that stand out to us based on their fundamentals  earnings momentum and exposure to long-term structural themes ” he said.“In Europe  we see strong interest in SAP and Adyen  each of which is supported by durable cash generation and positioning in areas such as enterprise software  digital payments and financial market infrastructure.One of the key trends for the Irish Stock Exchange has been companies shifting listings to US markets“In an Irish context  Flutter Entertainment and Kerry Group continue to screen well  reflecting global scale advantages and exposure to consumer and food innovation trends.""These companies operate in segments where we see sustained long-term growth drivers.”One of the key trends for the Irish Stock Exchange has been companies shifting listings to the more lucrative US markets.The likes of Smurfit Westrock  Flutter and CRH have done just that  hoping share prices would benefit thanks to vastly greater liquidity.Damian Roddy  head of capital markets at Davy  said more could be done to make Euronext Dublin cost competitive and encourage smaller IPOs.“Continued focus on reducing barriers to investment and fostering a supportive environment for listings will be key to ensuring that Irish businesses secure global capital to scale and grow into global leaders to replicate existing listed entities such as Ryanair  Kingspan and Kerry Group ” he said.“The capital markets ecosystem in Ireland has supported the growth and scaling of CRH  Smurfit and Flutter to become major international stocks.”",neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.41,0.22,0.37,True,English,"['AI investments', 'Allure', 'sign', 'dimming', 'analysts', ""Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary"", 'Taoiseach
