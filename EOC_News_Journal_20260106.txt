In the last 24 months  we have demonstrated our ability to meet our timelines and fulfil our obligations  and we appreciate the support that our long-term debtholders have given us ” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “To reinforce our cash position and better manage our resources  we have taken the opportunity to continue our successful collaboration with our financing partner and shareholder  Vester Finance. Based on our current cash on hand and the current timelines  this additional financing of up to €4 million extends our cash runway beyond the end of 2027. We are now in a healthier and significantly stronger position to navigate the future  including in our strategic discussions.”Nicox has fully repaid all outstanding debt with funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital1 using existing cash at 31 December 2025  thereby releasing all security guarantees over Nicox assets and terminating the right for Kreos Capital to appoint an Observer to the Board of Directors. This transaction coincides with raising new financing through the issuance of bonds to European investors  including Vester Finance  a current financing partner and established institutional investor. This financing consists of an issue of €3 million of convertible bonds and €1 million of ordinary bonds (subject to certain conditions precedent) and extends the Company’s cash runway beyond the end of 2027.

Today’s payment reimburses the remaining outstanding balance of that debt in totality. In accordance with the amendment announced on 14 October 2024  Kreos Capital retains 17 warrants giving the right to acquire 400 000 shares per warrant in Nicox at €0.25  which can be exercised until 14 October 2036.As of 31 December 2025  Nicox’s remaining debt amounted to €0.3 million  consisting entirely of the outstanding balance of a COVID loan  which will be repaid from cash in hand by the end of August 2026.New Bond Financing from Institutional InvestorsThe issuance of the convertible bonds was carried out based on the delegation granted by the Company’s shareholders during the General Meeting held on June 27  2025  under the 13th resolution2.The convertible bonds  with a nominal unit value of €10  were subscribed at 92% of their nominal value for a total subscription price of €3 000 028.00  paid in full on the day of subscription. The bonds bear no interest and are unsecured. The bonds are convertible at any time  at a conversion price determined based on the stock market price3 at the time  in accordance with pricing rules and the ceiling set by the shareholders’ meeting.The ordinary bonds with a nominal unit value of €9.20  have been subscribed by the same investors at 100% of their nominal value  for a total subscription price of €1 000 003.20. They do not bear any interest nor guarantees and have the same term as the convertible bonds. Their subscription price will be made as one payment  at the moment when certain conditions have been met  at the latest at the start of September 2026.At a term of 24 months following the issuance of the debt  the bonds will be redeemed at maturity at 100% of their nominal value if they have not been converted at that date.This transaction was advised by Vester Finance  which is also a subscriber to these bonds.For illustrative purposes  if all convertible bonds were converted based on the Nicox share closing price on December 31  2025  a shareholder holding 1% of the capital (calculated on the basis of the number of outstanding shares as of December 31  2025) prior to the issuance and conversion would hold 0.876% of the capital on a non-diluted basis and 0.650% on a fully diluted basis. The new shares issued from conversion will be subject to all the provisions of the Company’s bylaws. They will be fully fungible with existing ordinary shares and will carry the same rights.Risk FactorsRisk factors affecting the Company are detailed in section 3 of the “Rapport Annuel 2024” and in section 4 of the “Rapport semestriel 2025” which are available on Nicox’s website (www.nicox.com).Since the conversion price of the bonds set out above is linked to the Company’s share price  the exact number of shares to be issued upon conversion cannot be determined at the time of issuance  and such conversion may significantly dilute existing shareholders.Impact on the shareholder’s situation and on the distribution of share capitalThe following table  provided for illustrative purposes only  outlines various scenarios regarding the impact of the issuance of new shares resulting from the conversion of convertible bonds on the shareholder’s situation  depending on the evolution of the share price.Convertible bonds conversion price -10% Current* +10% Number of shares issued upon conversion of the convertible bonds 13 935 470 12 541 920 11 401 750 Number of outstanding shares after the issuance 102 377 243 100 983 693 99 843 523 Dilution of existing capital** 15.76% 14.18% 12.89% Stake of shareholder holding 1% of the share capital before conversion 0.864% 0.876% 0.886%*Closing price at 31 December 2025  i.e. €0.2980**Calculated on the basis of 88 441 773 Nicox shares as of December 31  2025The table below presents the Company’s share capital structure before and after the conversion of the convertible bonds  based on information available to the Company  and on the assumption that all the bonds are converted at a conversion price corresponding to the closing share price as at 31 December 2025:Shareholders Before conversion of the convertible bondsAfter conversion of the convertible bonds Number of shares % of equity Number of shares % of equity Ocumension 3 059 046 3.46 3 059 046 3.03 HBM Healthcare Investments 1 801 421 2.04 1 801 421 1.79 Vester Finance 175 000 0.20 10 033 580 9.95 Other bond holders - - 2 508 360 2.49 Treasury shares 311 067 0.35 311 067 0.31 Public 83 095 239 93.95 83 095 239 82.43 Total 88 441 773 100.00 100 808 713 100.00Prospectus – Admission to tradingThe bonds will not be subject to any application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of novel therapies for cancer and eye diseases  announced today updates on its research and development activities and its potential investment strategies.NOX-E36 developmentsTME Pharma announces the initiation of a subsequent study for NOX-E36 and the simultaneous termination of its collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) for the development of NOX-E36 for glaucoma filtration surgery  as previously announced on June 18  2025. The end of this partnership is unrelated to the quality and potential of NOX-E36. TME Pharma is pleased to confirm its commitment to this program with the launch in January 2026 of studies to validate detection of NOX-E36 in a toxicologically relevant animal  which are the first of the studies necessary to enable local administration of NOX-E36 to patients undergoing glaucoma filtration surgery to continue advancing this promising program.The costs of this initial study are limited  and by starting the study as planned  no further delays are necessary for follow-up studies. TME Pharma believes strongly in the potential of NOX-E36 and by starting this new program it will become easier to find a new partner to help further the research and development of this program either in collaboration with TME Pharma or through a carveout  sale  or joint venture for NOX-E36.Fibrosis is a major contributor to glaucoma filtration surgery treatment failure and increased severity in several clinically important eye diseases with significant unmet needs  such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Collectively  these conditions affect approximately 30 million people in the US alone  with millions at risk of vision-threatening complications. This underscores the substantial market potential for innovative anti-fibrotic therapies like NOX-E36 and the interest in a future partnership for this program.NOX-A12TME Pharma continues its active discussions with potential partners for the NOX-A12 program. TME Pharma has kept the clinical trial for glioblastoma open so that it can be resumed as soon as a suitable partner is found. TME Pharma expects to be able to present a clear update and strategy to the market in the coming weeks.Investment in CryptocurrenciesOn June 30  2025  TME Pharma announced a new treasury policy to allow investment in higher-risk assets such as crypto-currency related investments. To date  no attractive opportunity has presented itself  and the Company has not invested in the crypto markets. TME Pharma has closed the year with approximately €2.0 million in cash-on-hand (as compared to €2.06 million as at June 30  2025)  reflecting a responsible treasury policy and strict cost control.Investment in ‘GRDC’On November 5  2025  TME Pharma announced it had signed a non-binding LOI with a ‘German Resource Development Company’ (‘GRDC’). Discussions with this partner are still ongoing  and due diligence is underway. Only in the event that the discussions and due diligence are positive and the Company believes the transaction will create significant value  TME Pharma will submit it to the shareholders for approval.""We have high expectations for NOX-36 and NOX-E12 and are currently considering all options. We would have liked to continue the collaboration with SERI  but we also see opportunities to develop the program with other partners. TME is pursuing alternatives and will inform the market as soon as there is concrete news about ongoing discussions about NOX-E36 and NOX-E12."" said Diede van den Ouden  CEO. ""Moreover  as previously announced  I'm enthusiastic about the additional activities we are considering. Our status of being a listed company  which is structured as an holding company  is still opening up new interesting opportunities. I emphasize again that we will only present potential partnerships to shareholders that we believe could create significant shareholder value. We will act responsibly and proposals will be presented to our shareholders for approval when necessary.""For more information  please contact:TME Pharma N.V.Diede van den Ouden  CEOir@tmepharma.comAbout TME PharmaTME Pharma is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of novel therapies for cancer and eye diseases.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the supplemental biologic license application (sBLA) for Tzield (teplizumab-mzwv) to expand the current age indication from eight years and above  to as young as one year old and above to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. The sBLA is supported by the positive interim one-year data from the ongoing PETITE-T1D phase 4 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05757713)  evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Tzield in young children. The target action date for the FDA decision is April 29  2026.“This priority review emphasizes the urgent need for innovative therapies like Tzield which has the potential to prevent the natural progression of T1D by delaying the loss of endogenous insulin production. This might be particularly significant in this young population  as it is well documented that the autoimmune attack that drives this disease in many cases  begins  early in life ” said Christopher Corsico  Global Head of Development at Sanofi. “If approved  Tzield could represent an important advance for delaying the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes in early childhood  which would benefit patients and caregivers alike.”Interim data for the PETITE-T1D phase 4 study was presented at the 51st Annual Conference of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes and simultaneously published in Diabetologia.Priority review is given to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions.The safety and efficacy of Tzield in the PETITE-T1D population has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About PETITE-T1DPETITE-T1D (clinical study identifier: NCT05757713) is an ongoing phase 4 single-arm  non-randomized  open-label  multicentre study designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of Tzield in children under eight years diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Stage 2 T1D is defined by the presence of two or more T1D-related autoantibodies and dysglycaemia.The study has enrolled 23 participants. The regimen consists of an intravenous infusion of Tzield once daily for 14 consecutive days. The study duration for each individual may last up to 26 months for follow up and monitoring.About TzieldTzield (teplizumab-mzwv) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody. Tzield is the first and only disease-modifying therapy in autoimmune T1D; it was first approved in the US in November 2022 to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and children eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Today  it is also approved in China  the UK  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait for the same indication. In November 2025  the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use issued a positive recommendation for the same population (Tzield will be known as Teizeild in the EU). Other regulatory reviews are ongoing.About autoimmune T1DT1D is a progressive autoimmune disease where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin-producing beta cells by one’s own immune system. There are four stages to the progression of T1D:In stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range (normoglycaemia). At this stage  T1D is presymptomatic.In stage 2 (also presymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycaemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells/beta-cell function.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycaemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will start to experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision  and generalized fatigue. Management of stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.Stage 4 is defined as long-standing autoimmune T1D  often accompanied by evidence of chronic diabetic complications  where little to no beta cells remain (it’s been estimated that the beta-cell mass is reduced by up to 95%). At this point  the T1D-related autoantibodies might not be present anymore in the blood  as most beta cells have been rendered useless by the autoimmune attack.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.

The weekend just past  the first of the new year  truly delivered impressive bread and circuses worldwide  with the most cinematic arrest (or abduction) of all: the dictator Maduro being seized by the U.S. military and brought before a U.S. court in New York. Since the day before yesterday  an enormous amount has been written—thousands of analyses around the world. Let’s agree that the Americans changed the way they… finish off a regime. They basically did it Trump Administration–style: they went in and grabbed him  instead of waiting around with the classic methods of sabotage  etc. Before we get to the facts  I’d like to remind the domestic grieving Leftists (and other “democratic forces”) who are howling over Maduro of an article published shortly after Venezuela’s presidential elections in The Guardian—hardly a paper you’d call right-wing. The ideologically left-leaning British newspaper wrote in August 2024 that the Venezuelan opposition—now backed by Trump—proved  in many and varied ways  that the supposed 51% Maduro allegedly won was the product of widespread violence and ballot fraud. In short  he never actually got that percentage  since if you consult any mainstream Western media outlet today  you’ll read that the opposition took over 65%. For the record  let me remind you that the countries that recognized Maduro as the legitimately elected president were Russia  China  Iran  Serbia  Syria  Cuba  Bolivia  Nicaragua  and other such… democratic regimes. No Europeans  no Americans of course  and no one else in the West recognized the regime  at least after 2024. So those crying today should remember that Maduro was not a legitimately elected president chosen by his country’s citizens  as the entire opposition in Greece told us—from Alexis  who sent Pappas along with the offshore-savvy Cypriot Artemiou and… they were bringing something in private jets  all the way to Haritsis and the rest of the Left. Even Androulakis  in PASOK’s statement  produced some… mumblings  lest he be seen as right-wing. So yes  Maduro is both a dictator and a narco-trafficker  and the rest is of course up for discussion—but we’re not going to cry over international legality because  quite simply  in this case  it doesn’t exist. He was a ruthless narco-dictator  and in the coming days his atrocities will be revealed.Athens FIR – The year’s first mess-up!We leave the big international event and move on to an extremely serious incident that occurred yesterday morning at 9 a.m. and lasted for several hours: the closure of the Athens FIR due to interference on almost all frequencies used by pilots to communicate with Air Traffic Control. The issue  of course  is not just why it happened and how  but the most worrying fact is that we don’t actually know exactly what happened. Was it a malfunction  a hardware failure  or sabotage (which seems to have been ruled out)  and when will we find out? Since a lot is being said—mainly by air traffic controllers—about old systems  the need for new equipment  etc.  it would be good if today  even today  the competent minister Dimas told us and explained what happened and how. Yesterday was not the country’s best look…The lucky coin and Mitsotakis’ New Year’s Eve resolutionI’m moving away from the heavy and serious topic of the days with the Left’s beloved Nicolás and turning to our own festive matters  starting with some reporting I did (via a well-connected gossip) on the prime ministerial New Year’s Eve dinner and the news revealed by K.M. himself on New Year’s Day  during the exchange of wishes with President Tasoulas  about his son’s engagement. First of all  let me tell you that Mitsotakis spent New Year’s Eve with his family at a friend’s house where he traditionally goes (on the last day of the year) without fail since 2015. There are  after all  the relevant family photos—for the observant—with the same background  the Christmas tree  the same paintings  etc.  all these years. For the first time in his life  as he himself revealed—my source told me—Mitsotakis won the lucky coin in the New Year’s pie and also made a New Year’s Eve resolution (wishes–goals for the new year  if I may translate it)  which was more personal than political. So I learned that he said: “I wish 2026 to be a stepping-stone year  that we work well in all sectors and that things go well politically in 2027  but… even more  I wish that in 2027 we become grandparents!” That’s how  or something very close to it  he announced the engagement of his son Konstantinos to Maria Sakkari  to whom the 28-year-old proposed over Christmas. You  beyond the prime minister’s family matters  keep this in mind: elections are being planned for spring 2027.Escalation with the farmersAfter yesterday’s meeting at the Maximos Mansion and today’s first morning coffee of the year  the government’s final stance toward the farmers—who yesterday decided to go all-in on… the tsamiko dance and adopt a logic of full rupture—is being locked in. Administrative fines for tractors are obviously on the table  as is a more active stance by the police  since the farmers plan in the coming days to permanently block critical infrastructure of the country. It’s also being examined whether legislative regulation is needed to tighten the framework. The government  however  will also seek an overall new positioning on the issue  as the scenario of dialogue—and the prospect of breaking up the blockades—has now come to an end.Marinakis’ response to the KKEYesterday morning  at one of the New Year’s pie-cuttings in the municipality of Nea Filadelfeia  Pavlos Marinakis found himself confronted by a KKE municipal councilor who went after the government over its stance on Venezuela. The spokesman didn’t mince words  of course—something I expect to see again today at the briefing. “I’m proud to represent a prime minister who is on the right side of history; some choose to side with a dictator  a friend of Erdoğan and Putin ” Marinakis said  continuing his fire by adding that he doesn’t recall the KKE showing the same sensitivity when Russia invaded Ukraine—a country with an internationally recognized government.Psyomiadis–KarystianouGiven that the people around Maria Karystianou come from the right and probably the far right  over the weekend scenarios began circulating about the involvement of former Thessaloniki prefect Panagiotis (Panikas to friends) Psyomiadis in the whole venture. Psyomiadis has withdrawn from the spotlight because he has court cases  but he continues to maintain a significant network of contacts in Thessaloniki and Macedonia in general  especially within the Pontic Greek community. He may not be in the first flush of youth  but he doesn’t seem to be giving up—although people around him were saying things like “there’s nothing for now” regarding the prospect of his participation in a new party. As for the future  though?Markets: Business as usual and we’ll seeReturning to Maduro’s arrest  I should note that analysts’ assessments for the markets are not alarming. We’ve entered a new period of international politics; the bar of geopolitical concern was raised after U.S. references to Cuba  Colombia  and Mexico  but for now we do not expect shocks in the markets due to developments in Venezuela. The market had priced in—not the specific operation  of course  but the escalation of the crisis. The oil market showed no signs of concern; analysts are talking at most about limited short-term upward moves. Overall  initial reactions in futures products raise no concern  so the event will be priced in today by stock markets as well  without—at least it seems—the Venezuela factor exerting downward pressure.The Greek businessman who paid €735.5 million in taxes and the builder with €4.5 billionIn the U.S.  where everything is measured  the most successful hedge fund manager is considered to be Soros  who delivered a 20% return every year for many consecutive years. The hedge fund manager who broke every annual return record was Paulson  who made around $6 billion in profits during the 2008 crisis. By the same logic  then  the company and businessman who contributed the largest amount to public coffers last year was Karelias. Due to excise duties  VAT  corporate and other taxes  Karelias calculated that it paid a total of €735.5 million—an amount corresponding to over 1% of the Greek state’s total tax revenues of all kinds in 2025  and the largest tax contribution in its history  as it pays significant sums every year. This record for the Kalamata-based company is the result of its performance last year  as its sales volume increased by 9% and its organic profitability by about 11% compared to 2024—despite Karelias being affected by the weak dollar against the euro. The record for a one-off boost to public coffers belongs to Peristeris of GEK TERNA  who over the last 14 months (October ’24–December ’25) paid €4.54 billion in concession fees (€3.27 billion for Attiki Odos and €1.27 billion for Egnatia). Everything seems to come in sevens—won’t he buy a lottery ticket too?OPAP’s big dayAt the shareholders’ general meeting of OPAP the day after tomorrow  the organization’s plan for the next day will be decided. Allwyn continues to increase its stake and on the last day of 2025 acquired an additional 131 967 OPAP shares at an average price of €18.7743 per share (a total of €2 477 588). So  the day after tomorrow  Wednesday  OPAP shareholders will be called upon to decide on the proposed terms of the reverse merger. Those OPAP shareholders who decide to vote against the proposed agreement secure an exit option at a price of €19.04  with a one-month window to exercise it. Those voting in favor must do so in writing by today  since tomorrow  6/1  is the Epiphany public holiday. OPAP and Allwyn have stated that if the percentage of those validly exercising the exit right exceeds 5% of OPAP’s share capital  the cross-border conversion will be canceled—unless it is deemed necessary to have a different outcome regarding changing or lifting this threshold  following Allwyn’s written consent.Zeroes don’t dent Tyler’s moraleWith delays  it seems  is progressing Tyler Macbeth’s business venture regarding the gym he wants to open in Athens. As is known  Stefanos Kasselakis’ husband founded the company Barry’s Greece Single-Member S.A. on September 30  2024  with the purpose of providing gym services  specialized fitness (aerobics  Pilates  yoga  etc.)  apparatus and non-apparatus training—essentially aiming to bring a branch of the renowned American fitness chain Barry’s to Greece. The company’s registered office is at Leventi 5 in Kolonaki  where the couple’s luxury apartment is located  while the initial share capital amounted to €1 000  paid by Tyler Macbeth himself. According to information circulating at the time  two floors of a building on Kanari Street  also in Kolonaki  had been leased for the gym. However  along the way  something appears to have gone… wrong  and the gym never opened. More recent information says that another space has been leased  this time on Othonos Street in Syntagma  and that the opening is scheduled for the first months of 2026. Recently  however  Tyler’s company released its first financial results for the 2024 fiscal year  which are an… ode to zero. That is  for the September–December 2024 quarter  the company understandably recorded zero turnover and zero results  while every column (profit margin  loans  equity  liquidity  etc.) is dominated by… zero. As noted—apparently out of sheer habit—“the company’s financial ratios are satisfactory  especially considering the specific conditions affecting the sector in which it operates.” As for the next fiscal year  the continuation of the company’s course is anticipated  while regarding “significant events after the end of the fiscal year ” it is stressed that “beyond the events already mentioned  there are no material post-balance-sheet events as of 31/12/2024 that concern the company.” The balance sheet is signed on September 10  2025—so I assume we’re still in the… warm-up phase.Airport blackout: the first real test for the Athens Airport shareI return from a different angle to the unprecedented problem that paralyzed Greek airspace yesterday  which today will constitute the first serious test for the share of Athens International Airport (AIA). Since its stock market debut in February 2024  AIA has been the great success story of the Greek capital market. Its market capitalization rose to €3.3 billion  delivering an annual return of 36.4%. Today it faces its first major test  and the reaction of international investors toward a high-yield “utility” stock is of great interest. The AIA share began its stock market journey on February 7  2024  with an impressive debut  opening at €9.50 (+15.85%) compared to the offer price of €8.20. Demand exceeded supply by 23 times in the domestic market  while overall the IPO attracted more than €3 billion in interest. Athens Airport aims to establish itself as a leading transportation hub in Southeastern Europe  having handled more than 34 million passengers last year. In approximately 40 days from now  the international tender process for the expansion projects of the main and satellite terminals will be completed—a project worth €1.28 billion.New corporate bond issues on the Athens Exchange—and shipping in the backgroundOther companies are preparing to take the baton of corporate bonds being listed for trading on the Athens Stock Exchange in 2026. Activity was already elevated last year  with the most recent example being AKTOR’s retail bond (the company’s first)  amounting to €140 million. Lamda Development  Aegean  and GEK TERNA had preceded it. In total  more than €1.3 billion was raised last year through retail bond issues. Now it’s the turn of other major groups—as well as shipping companies  specifically Greek-interest firms listed on Wall Street—to proceed with corporate bond issues targeting Greek investors. At the same time  ahead of the anticipated inclusion of the Athens Exchange in Euronext  efforts are underway to attract additional Greek shipping companies that are currently listed or have bonds trading in Oslo and on the NYSE. After all  Euronext’s CEO had indirectly revealed this intention when  during a press conference in Athens and answering a question about what Euronext membership could offer  he said: “You have the largest shipping industry globally  yet Oslo has more listed shipping companies.”The Public Debt Management Agency’s New Year traditionAt the start of each new year  Greece’s Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) presents to the Ministry of Finance the overall plan for sovereign bond issuances. This year  according to information  the program begins in a few days with the issuance of a 10-year bond. This is primarily a precautionary move  aimed at testing market sentiment toward Greek bonds. The same approach was taken last year by Dimitris Tsakonas. Early on—mid-January 2025—he mandated Goldman Sachs  BofA Securities  Morgan Stanley  Deutsche Bank  Société Générale  and the National Bank of Greece to coordinate a €3 billion issue  which ultimately met with spectacular success  as demand from international investors exceeded €33 billion. As a result  the country covered its borrowing needs very early in the year  avoiding major turbulence and periods of congestion. This year  beyond covering financing needs  Greece aims to drastically reduce its liabilities from the bilateral loans (Greek Loan Facility) of the first bailout  which carry much higher interest rates compared to those Greece secures today.2026: the year of big debtIf there is one common characteristic in today’s economic and business landscape  it is the ease with which debt is created. Governments  businesses  and individuals borrow easily (not always cheaply)  because there is always someone with abundant capital willing to lend. The IIF Global Debt Monitor presented its latest data  revealing that global debt reached a historic record of $346 trillion in the third quarter of 2025. At the exact same time  the era of “free money” from Japan came to an end. According to the IIF  global debt rose by +57% over eight years  from $220 trillion in 2017. Interestingly  debt as a percentage of GDP paints a different picture: after peaking above 340% in 2020  it gradually declined to around 310%. Global economic growth is trying to outpace debt accumulation. The big change this year  however  comes from the explosive rise in Japanese bond yields. The yield on the 10-year JGB surpassed 2%  a level not seen since 1999  while 30- and 40-year bonds reached historic highs of 3.42% and 3.72%  respectively. The Bank of Japan has been led since April 2023 by the “wise elder” Kazuo Ueda  aged 73—the first academic economist to head the BoJ in the postwar era. His appointment surprised everyone  as he wasn’t even a candidate. Ueda proceeded with the first yen interest rate hike in 17 years  definitively ending the zero-interest-rate policy.…and the year of major records at the Athens Stock ExchangeThe Athens Stock Exchange opens today’s session at 2 158 points  having delivered a positive return for the fifth consecutive year in 2025  with the General Index gaining +44.3%. This is the sixth-highest return globally  following the stock markets of Seoul  Tel Aviv  Vietnam  Madrid  and Vienna. Over the past five years  the General Index has delivered returns of +162.4%  while the Banking Index recorded five-year gains of 342%. Particularly significant is the dividend yield of the Athens Exchange  with dividend distributions totaling €5 billion. Retail investor participation increased significantly (+20%) but remains far from past records. According to ATHEX data  active investor accounts reached 29 037. In the first half of December alone  1 091 new accounts were opened. Foreign investor participation—or rather  investors placing capital in Athens from abroad—has reached 70% of total market capitalization  which stands at €146.2 billion. Greece’s GDP in 2025 is estimated at €243–245 billion  meaning stock market capitalization amounts to 60% of GDP. In the U.S.  where things have gone off the rails  Wall Street’s capitalization corresponds to over 150% of GDP; in Germany  the figure ranges between 60–65%  while in troubled France it has exceeded 110% of GDP.Maduro’s arrest boosted… Nike salesIn one of the most unexpected cases of viral marketing we’ve seen  the arrest of Nicolás Maduro created an… upward trend in Nike sales. The Venezuelan dictator evolved into a Nike influencer. Search engine data show a striking spike in searches for “Nike Tech Fleece” immediately after photos of the Venezuelan leader were posted. Maduro appeared on our screens wearing Nike’s signature tracksuit  and within hours  Maduro’s size sold out in stores. The phenomenon is not unprecedented in Latin America. Fidel Castro  another famous leader of the region  was known for his love of tracksuits  effectively making the “track suit” an almost official uniform for socialist leaders on the continent. Nike’s brand managers couldn’t have imagined better—albeit ironic—advertising. In the age of social media dominance  even the most serious geopolitical developments can turn into moments of pop culture and consumer behavior.The Minnesota scandal put 6 900 borrowers on holdLike all bailout-era governments  the Trump administration periodically exposes past financial scandals to justify layoffs of public employees  spending cuts  and heavy consumption taxes (i.e.  tariffs) imposed to clean up public finances. The Small Business Administration (SBA) announced the suspension of 6 900 borrowers in Minnesota due to suspected fraudulent activity. The move  reported by FOX  reveals the scale of a problem that has plagued the U.S. business support system since the pandemic era. The suspensions mainly concern loans granted under COVID-19 emergency programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and EIDL loans. According to information  authorities identified suspicious patterns in thousands of applications  including falsified income statements  non-existent businesses  and forged documents. The most striking element is that despite the massive scale of the scandal  no criminal charges have yet been announced. The SBA is currently focusing on administrative suspensions  while federal prosecutors are expected to act at a later stage. The question now is whether the Minnesota case is isolated. It appears it is not. According to FOX News  U.S. authorities have identified tens of thousands of potential fraud cases in pandemic support programs. The Department of Justice has already prosecuted more than 3 000 cases nationwide  with the total amount of improperly paid funds exceeding $1.4 billion.,negative,0.0,0.3,0.69,mixed,0.24,0.19,0.57,True,English,"['The Left', 'first stumble', 'Athens FIR', 'K.M.', 'Eve resolution', 'biggest tax', 'New Year', 'tears', 'Maduro', 'Greek', 'mainstream Western media outlet', 'prime ministerial New Year', 'domestic grieving Leftists', 'offshore-savvy Cypriot Artemiou', 'Air Traffic Control', 'U.S. military', 'U.S. court', 'other “democratic forces', 'big international event', 'competent minister Dimas', 'first morning coffee', 'relevant family photos', 'Nicolás', 'democratic regimes', 'international legality', 'first mess-up', 'first time', 'New York', 'new equipment', 'impressive bread', 'cinematic arrest', 'enormous amount', 'classic methods', 'The Guardian', 'varied ways', 'widespread violence', 'ballot fraud', 'private jets', 'Even Androulakis', 'ruthless narco-dictator', 'Athens FIR', 'serious incident', 'several hours', 'worrying fact', 'hardware failure', 'old systems', 'best look', 'lucky coin', 'serious topic', 'festive matters', 'K.M.', 'same background', 'same paintings', 'Maria Sakkari', 'family matters', 'Maximos Mansion', 'final stance', 'tsamiko dance', 'full rupture', 'Administrative fines', 'stepping-stone year', 'Eve resolution', 'Eve dinner', 'Venezuelan opposition', 'entire opposition', 'Trump Administration', 'presidential elections', 'coming days', 'Christmas tree', 'President Tasoulas', 'last day', 'dictator Maduro', '51% Maduro', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'circuses', 'abduction', 'yesterday', 'thousands', 'analyses', 'world', 'Americans', 'style', 'sabotage', 'facts', 'article', 'paper', 'August', 'many', 'product', 'percentage', 'record', 'countries', 'Russia', 'China', 'Iran', 'Serbia', 'Syria', 'Cuba', 'Bolivia', 'Nicaragua', 'Europeans', 'country', 'citizens', 'Greece', 'Alexis', 'Pappas', 'something', 'Haritsis', 'PASOK', 'statement', 'mumblings', 'right-wing', 'narco-trafficker', 'course', 'discussion', 'case', 'atrocities', '9 a', 'closure', 'interference', 'frequencies', 'pilots', 'issue', 'malfunction', 'need', 'Mitsotakis', 'heavy', 'reporting', 'connected', 'gossip', 'exchange', 'wishes', 'son', 'engagement', 'friend', 'house', 'observant', 'years', 'life', 'source', 'pie', 'sectors', 'things', 'grandparents', 'Konstantinos', '28-year', 'mind', 'spring', 'Escalation', 'farmers', 'meeting', 'government', 'logic', 'tractors', 'table']",2026-01-05,2026-01-06,en.protothema.gr
