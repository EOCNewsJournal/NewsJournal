Kingspan will also hold a capital markets day in the US later in the year to provide “further insights” on the strategy  it said.Chief executive Gene Murtagh said the group was “very pleased with investor appetite” for Advnsys  a world leader in bespoke critical infrastructure primarily focused on data centres  ventilation  and daylighting.“In light of that interest  and given current momentum and outlook  our considered view is that retaining full ownership of this fast-growing business is the optimum route to maximise value for our stakeholders ” he said.Kingspan said it believes strongly in the unit’s trajectory  including its target of more than doubling earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) over the next four to five years.The group’s Dublin-listed shares fell by more than 3 per cent in early trading on Wednesday before paring losses later in the day.In September  the group announced that it was exploring plans to list about 25 per cent of the business on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as the first quarter of 2026.Shares in Kingspan jumped as much as 13.5 per cent immediately after the initial announcement.Still  analysts on Wednesday broadly welcomed the decision to drop the spin out.“The more granular level of information that has been published by Kingspan on Advynsys since the potential IPO was announced makes us even more bullish on the medium-term prospects for the group as a whole ” Goodbody analyst Shane Carberry said in a research note. “The backdrop for Advynsys continues to go from strength to strength and as the group further unlocks the significant opportunities to gain greater share of wallet  not just through increasing its array of products but also through modularity  future ambitions to double profitability look very well underpinned ” he added.Pulling back from the IPO meanwhile has “no impact on our financial forecasts as we had not made any adjustments for this possibility ” said Davy analyst Flor O’Donoghue. “Kingspan remains exceptionally well placed as a business  and this should be confirmed when the group announces 2025 results in February ” he added.The planned IPO could have valued Advynsys at about €6 billion if it had gone ahead  Mr O’Donoghue said when Kingpsan announced its IPO plan.Advynsys accounts for about a fifth of Kingspan’s group earnings as it stands.The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has seen a surge in data centre construction around the world  as companies from OpenAI to Google pump billions into building out the computing power needed for their large language models.The data centre sector could require as much as $3 trillion (€2.6 trillion) in spending globally between now and 2030 to meet demand  property firm JLL said in a report published this week.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.43,0.32,True,English,"['unit riding data centres boom', 'Kingspan', 'spin-off', 'next four to five years', 'Davy analyst Flor O’Donoghue', 'Goodbody analyst Shane Carberry', 'The Cavan-based insulation giant', 'Chief executive Gene Murtagh', 'artificial intelligence (AI) boom', 'advanced building systems unit', 'Mr O’Donoghue', 'artificial intelligence-driven boom', 'bespoke critical infrastructure', 'large language models', 'data centre construction', 'data centre sector', 'capital markets day', '100 per cent ownership', 'data centres', '25 per cent', 'full ownership', '3 per cent', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'first quarter', 'further insights', 'investor appetite', 'current momentum', 'optimum route', 'early trading', 'initial announcement', 'granular level', 'medium-term prospects', 'research note', 'significant opportunities', 'greater share', 'future ambitions', 'financial forecasts', 'computing power', 'property firm', 'world leader', 'Dublin-listed shares', 'potential IPO', 'IPO plan', 'growing business', 'group earnings', 'plans', 'Kingspan', 'Advnsys', 'Wednesday', 'strategy', 'ventilation', 'daylighting', 'interest', 'outlook', 'view', 'value', 'stakeholders', 'trajectory', 'target', 'doubling', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Ebitda', 'losses', 'September', 'analysts', 'decision', 'spin', 'information', 'Advynsys', 'backdrop', 'strength', 'wallet', 'array', 'products', 'modularity', 'profitability', 'impact', 'adjustments', 'possibility', '2025 results', 'February', 'Kingpsan', 'fifth', 'surge', 'companies', 'OpenAI', 'Google', 'billions', 'demand', 'JLL', 'report', '13.5']",2026-01-07,2026-01-08,irishtimes.com

Updates from the ABTECT Phase 3 maintenance trial evaluating obefazimod for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active UC reinforce the therapy’s safety profile and inform potential future combination strategies.Marc de Garidel  MBA  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  commented: “As I reflect on our advances in 2025  I am beyond thankful for the patients and physicians who have helped advance our trials and for the Abivax employees and investors who supported this progress. This past year was a monumental one for Abivax as we announced positive data from our ABTECT Phase 3 8-week induction trial demonstrating obefazimod’s safety and potential as a first-in-class oral therapy for UC  we shared updates at major international meetings  and we closed a successful significant fundraising round. In 2026  I look forward to continuing this momentum as we evaluate the ABTECT-UC Phase 3 maintenance and ENHANCE-CD Phase 2 induction data and identify new opportunities for advancement of our pipeline. The findings shared today from the updated market research and DSMB safety analyses demonstrate the significant opportunity we have for making a real impact for the millions of patients inadequately addressed by current treatment options.”LOOKING AHEAD TO 2026:Ulcerative Colitis Market OpportunityMultiple third-party industry analyses forecast significant growth in the ulcerative colitis (UC) market over the coming years  driven by increased use of advanced therapies and the launch of innovative mechanisms of action (MOAs). In one recently published report  worldwide UC sales are expected to more than double  increasing from $9.2 billion in 2025 to $21.2 billion by 2032.In this context  market research following the announcement of the ABTECT Phase 3 induction results in July 2025 indicates that obefazimod may emerge as the future market leader in UC  potentially outperforming both currently approved therapies and anticipated future entrants  including TL1A inhibitors and oral IL-23 agents.The research estimated that roughly 500K patients within the United States are currently on conventional therapies (5ASA’s/corticosteroids)  with approximately 60% of these patients being moderate/severe (~300K patients). Physicians indicated they would likely initiate treatment with obefazimod for this population where reluctance to advanced therapies hinder their use.ABTECT Phase 3 DSMB Update  Maintenance Topline Results  and Expected US Filing TimingThe ABTECT Phase 3 DSMB meeting occurred on December 18  2025  and reported no new safety signals with over 80% of participants having completed the 44-week double blind maintenance phase of the trial.Topline results from the ongoing ABTECT Phase 3 maintenance trial are expected in late Q2 2026 which has the potential to further demonstrate the durability of obefazimod treatment in UC and extended duration of therapy versus the currently available treatment options.Ongoing New Drug Application (NDA) preparation includes planned engagement with the FDA in anticipation of planned filing in late 2026.Pipeline AdvancementObefazimod has a first-in-class mechanism of action that targets the site of inflammation and  together with preclinical evidence of a clear anti-fibrotic effect in Crohn’s disease  underscores its potential as a differentiated treatment option for patients with the condition. Detailed results  including 22 abstracts  will be shared at the 2026 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) Annual Meeting taking place in Stockholm  Sweden on February 18-21  2026.The ENHANCE-CD Phase 2b  designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of obefazimod in patients with moderate-to-severely active Crohn’s disease (CD)  is actively progressing. The 12-week induction trial results are anticipated in late 2026 and will help inform the design of subsequent registrational studies.Throughout 2026  initial preclinical results from ongoing studies evaluating obefazimod in combination with other agents (currently targeted combination MOAs include IL-23  a4b7  PDE-4 and AhR) will be shared  with a lead combination candidate selected to advance into development by year-end.The company is also continuing to evaluate follow-on miR-124 enhancers in various chronic inflammatory models to further extend the mechanistic framework established with obefazimod. In parallel  the team is evaluating potential in-licensing opportunities for innovative  mechanistically complementary assets in inflammatory bowel disease to strengthen its portfolio.Marc de Garidel continued: “This past year we have worked diligently to advance obefazimod in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease  showcasing the immense opportunity we have in expanding the current market and the potential for movement into first- and second-line therapy options. With our recently secured funding poised to support us into Q4 2027  we are now focused on completing our ABTECT Phase 3 maintenance trial to support potential NDA filing by the end of the year  completing our Phase 2b Crohn’s disease trial  and evaluating additional opportunities for advancement across our pipeline. We look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year as we aim to offer a safer  more effective and durable treatment option for those impacted by chronic inflammatory diseases like UC and Crohn’s.”Abivax 2026 Financial Reporting CalendarMarch 23  2026: Fiscal Year 2025 Financial ResultsJune 1  2026: Q1 2026 Financial ResultsJune 5  2026: Annual General Meeting / Extraordinary General MeetingSeptember 14  2026: H1 2026 Financial ResultsDecember 14  2026: Q3 2026 Financial ResultsAbout AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.
