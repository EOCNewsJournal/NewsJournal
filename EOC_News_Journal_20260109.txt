Read full story,"FRANKFURT  Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's benchmark DAX index surged to a new all-time intraday high on Thursday  trading amid signs that the bullish trends at the stock market are going on.The DAX index reached 25 217.52 points after surpassing the key threshold of 25 000 points for the first time in history on Wednesday.German shares have climbed in the first week of trading in the new year despite heightened global geopolitical tensions. The DAX index has already notched four new record highs in 2026  extending a bullish trend that began in the second half of 2022.Thursday's rally was fueled by the stronger-than-expected incoming orders for the manufacturing sector. New orders rose by 5.6 percent in November compared with October  according to official data.""It is finally good news for the industry again "" Marc Schattenberg  an economist from Deutsche Bank Research  was quoted as saying by German media.The DAX  seen as a barometer of the German economy  has been on a strong upward trajectory since the second half of 2022. The index gained 23 percent in 2025  18.85 percent in 2024  and 20.3 percent in 2023  reflecting investor optimism despite Germany's faltering economic performance.A December forecast by the German central bank projected that recovery would remain subdued early in 2026  with stronger growth expected only from the second quarter.A major reason for the disconnection between the DAX and the national economy is the global reach of DAX-listed firms. Nearly all DAX constituents are large multinationals with operations worldwide.The market rally has coincided with a notable shift in public sentiment toward stock trading. Traditionally seen as risk-averse  German retail investors - especially younger ones - have increasingly become shareholders in recent years.Some 12.1 million people in Germany  or 17.2 percent of the total population  were investing in equity funds  ETFs or shares in 2024  according to the German institute Deutsches Aktieninstitut.As the DAX index is hovering around record highs  the latest survey published by Deutsche Boerse on Wednesday showed diverging views between institutional and retail investors. The share of institutional investors with a bearish outlook rose by six percent compared with the previous survey  while 56 percent of private investors are now on the bullish side.",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.0,positive,0.67,0.32,0.0,True,English,"['new record highs', 'DAX index', 'Roundup', 'Germany', 'German institute Deutsches Aktieninstitut', 'four new record highs', 'strong upward trajectory', 'faltering economic performance', 'German central bank', 'global geopolitical tensions', 'Deutsche Bank Research', 'benchmark DAX index', 'German retail investors', 'The DAX index', 'German media', 'German economy', 'global reach', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'DAX constituents', 'new year', 'New orders', 'private investors', 'German shares', 'intraday high', 'bullish trends', 'stock market', 'key threshold', 'first time', 'first week', 'second half', 'incoming orders', 'manufacturing sector', 'official data', 'good news', 'Marc Schattenberg', 'investor optimism', 'December forecast', 'stronger growth', 'second quarter', 'major reason', 'national economy', 'DAX-listed firms', 'large multinationals', 'notable shift', 'public sentiment', 'recent years', '12.1 million people', 'total population', 'equity funds', 'latest survey', 'diverging views', 'bearish outlook', 'previous survey', 'bullish side', 'institutional investors', 'market rally', 'stock trading', 'six percent', '5.6 percent', '23 percent', '18.85 percent', '20.3 percent', '17.2 percent', '56 percent', 'FRANKFURT', 'Jan.', 'Xinhua', 'Germany', 'Thursday', 'signs', '25,217.52 points', '25,000 points', 'history', 'Wednesday', 'November', 'October', 'industry', 'economist', 'barometer', 'recovery', 'disconnection', 'operations', 'risk', 'averse', 'younger', 'shareholders', 'ETFs']",2026-01-09,2026-01-09,thestar.com.my

This effect was further compounded by the weakening of the British pound  the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.The currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures.FINANCIAL POSITIONApart from the seasonal changes in working capital  there were no material changes in the Group's financial position as of November 30  2025  relative to that presented in the Fiscal 2025 Universal Registration Document filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) on October 31  2025.PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESThere were no significant changes to the principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group in the Risk Factors section of the Fiscal 2025 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on October 31  2025.ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURE DEFINITIONSGrowth excluding currency effectThe currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures except in hyper-inflationary economies where all figures are converted at the latest closing rate for both periods when the impact is significant.For Türkiye  despite being in hyperinflation  the average exchange rates of the previous period are used due to the lack of materiality.Organic growthOrganic growth corresponds to the increase in revenue for a given period (the “current period”) compared to the revenue reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year  calculated using the exchange rate for the prior fiscal year; and excluding the impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments  as follows:for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Underlying operating profit marginThe Underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe Underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting Fiscal 2026 figures at Fiscal 2025 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.Attachment",neutral,0.13,0.87,0.0,mixed,0.48,0.19,0.33,True,English,"['Sodexo Q1 Fiscal 2026 revenues', 'line', 'expectations', 'Q1 FY26 Q1 FY25 ORGANIC', 'First quarter Fiscal 2026 consolidated revenues', 'neutral to moderate contribution', 'U.S. Education initiatives', 'Q1 organic revenue growth', 'U.S. dollar', 'Q1 FISCAL 2026 REVENUES', 'exceptional event activity', 'Grupo Mediterránea', 'customary regulatory approvals', 'operating profit margin', 'negative currency impact', 'clear near-term priorities', 'past contract losses', 'Fiscal 2026 guidance framework', 'Global Business Services', 'strong prior-year comparison', 'net new business', 'new Healthcare contracts', 'Organic growth', 'first actions', 'GROWTH CURRENCY', 'new contracts', 'operating model', 'high prior-year', 'early priorities', 'critical priorities', 'Operational priorities', 'GROWTH EXTERNAL', 'solid growth', 'growth drivers', 'strong assets', 'contract exits', 'existing contracts', 'strong commitment', 'minimum +2% contribution', 'large contract', 'Euronext Paris', 'million euros', 'North America', 'Thierry Delaporte', 'initial observations', 'real room', 'client centricity', 'operational efficiency', 'important work', 'initial views', 'full assessment', 'summer break', 'full potential', 'billion euros', 'negligible effect', 'positive contributions', 'recent months', 'dynamic markets', 'sales effectiveness', 'supply management', 'medium term', 'M&A', 'coming months', 'prestigious A-List', 'highest rating', 'transparent disclosure', 'climate journeys', 'one-off reclassification', 'Leadership changes', 'direct leadership', 'Planned investments', 'Group CEO', 'strong performance', 'EFFECT TOTAL', 'talented people', 'environmental sustainability', 'Sodexo CEO', 'Sodexo Live', 'climate performance', 'Issy-les-Moulineaux', 'January', 'OTC', 'SDXAY', 'Europe', 'World', 'time', 'field', 'teams', 'clients', 'understanding', 'realities', 'order', 'opportunity', 'motion', 'execution', 'half-year', 'Highlights', 'period', 'depreciation', 'acquisitions', 'disposals', 'geography', 'Administration', 'Paralympics', 'Australia', 'India', 'Brazil', 'Chile', 'technology', 'region', 'CDP', 'recognition', 'stakeholders', 'Outlook', 'pricing', 'volume', 'renewal', 'mix', 'phasing', 'foundations']",2026-01-08,2026-01-09,globenewswire.com

While the transition to a low-carbon economy is a long-term journey  this recognition reinforces our ability to create sustainable value for our customers and stakeholders.”The improvement in Quadient’s CDP score is notably driven by the validation of its climate targets by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  an advanced analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities to better inform decision-making and for continued progress in life cycle assessments and eco-design  including the launch of more energy-efficient solutions.Quadient’s climate targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway and validated by SBTi. These targets include a 64% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 30% reduction in absolute Scope 3 emissions by 2030  compared to 2018  as well as the achievement of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050. As of 2024  Quadient has already achieved a 55% reduction in combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions.This progress reflects ongoing efforts to reduce emissions across the company’s operations by optimizing energy use in buildings  increasing the share of low-carbon energy  decarbonizing its vehicle fleet and limiting business travel through remote and flexible work practices. Sustainability is also embedded into product design and manufacturing. Quadient aims to have 80% of its product ranges covered by life cycle assessments by the end of 2026  ensuring that new designs have a lower environmental impact than previous generations.Transparency and accountability remain central to Quadient’s approach. The company measures its carbon footprint annually in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and reports its progress through recognized frameworks such as CDP  providing stakeholders with a clear and consistent view of its climate performance. This recognition reinforces Quadient’s ambition to elevate sustainability beyond compliance and make it a strategic lever for growth and impact. It also reflects Quadient’s ongoing efforts to integrate sustainability into its solutions  supporting customers and stakeholders in their sustainability journeys through 2030 and beyond.For more information about Quadient’s sustainability commitments  visit invest.quadient.com/en/corporate-social-responsibility.About Quadient®Quadient is a global automation platform powering secure and sustainable business connections through digital and physical channels.

RUCONEST® continued to grow in an increasingly competitive environment  while Joenja® uptake accelerated with rising U.S. patient demand and international expansion.
