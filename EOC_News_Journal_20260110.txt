Transgene’s trial with TG4050 was designed to assess whether inducing neoantigen-specific T-cell responses following treatment with an INTV encoding up to 30 predicted tumor neoantigens delivered via a Modified Ankara Virus (MVA) vector could help reduce the risk of relapse.Half of the participants received TG4050 immediately after completing primary adjuvant treatment  while the other half were administered the vaccine at the time of disease recurrence  as an additional therapy alongside the standard of care.With 100% disease-free survival at two years  the data suggest that individualized treatment with TG4050 does have the potential to prevent cancer relapses when administered as monotherapy in an adjuvant treatment regimen in patients with high risk  resected  locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC. In addition  TG4050 was well-tolerated and showed no unexpected safety signals.Detailed translational findings from patients treated with TG4050 confirm durable  neoantigen-specific T-cell responsesThe translational data show that TG4050 induced neoantigen-specific T cell responses in the majority of treated patients (73% of 15 evaluable patients). These responses were durable  with cytotoxic and effector phenotype markers expressed up to one year after the end of treatment.An overview of these data were first presented at the 2025 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting (see press release) and support TG4050’s ability to induce neoantigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses capable of targeting and eliminating tumor cells  thereby contributing to the prevention of cancer relapse  when used as monotherapy in patients with HNSCC.TG4050 is currently under further evaluation in a randomized Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT04183166)  in patients with HNSCC.“The publication of TG4050’s Phase I results on medRxiv is an important step for Transgene. Making these data available to the global scientific community underscores our commitment to transparency and scientific rigor. The findings show encouraging evidence of TG4050’s ability to induce durable  neoantigen-specific immune responses and its potential in preventing relapse in patients with HPV-negative operable head and neck cancer. We look forward to advancing TG4050 through Phase II with the same determination and patient-centered approach” said Katell Bidet-Huang  Head of translational medicine at Transgene.The preprint on medRxiv provides early access to these important clinical findings ahead of peer-reviewed journal publication.Title: “Viral-based individualized neoantigen vaccine as adjuvant treatment in resected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: immunogenicity and efficacy from a randomized Phase I trial”The preprint is available on medRxiv and on Transgene websites.***ContactsTransgene: Media: Investors & Analysts: Caroline Tosch Lucie Larguier Corporate and Scientific Communications Manager Chief Financial Officer (CFO) +33 (0)3 68 33 27 38 Nadege Bartoli communication@transgene.fr Investor Relations Analystand Financial Communications Officer MEDiSTRAVA +33 (0)3 88 27 91 00/03 Frazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi investorrelations@transgene.fr + 44 (0)203 928 6900 transgene@medistrava.comAbout TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

This virus-based individualized neoantigen therapeutic vaccine (INTV) encodes neoantigens (patient-specific mutations) identified and selected by NEC’s Neoantigen Prediction System. The prediction system is based on more than two decades of expertise in AI and has been trained on proprietary data allowing it to accurately prioritize and select the most immunogenic sequences.TG4050 is designed to stimulate the immune system of patients in order to induce a T-cell response that is able to recognize and destroy tumor cells based on their own neoantigens. This individualized immunotherapy is developed and produced for each patient.About the Phase I/II Clinical TrialTG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancers ( NCT04183166 ). An individualized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants received their vaccine immediately after completing adjuvant treatment. The other half were given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to standard of care (SoC). This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who are at risk of relapse. In the Phase I part  thirty-two evaluable patients have been included. First immunogenicity data from the Phase II part of the trial are expected to be available in H2 2026. The first efficacy data will become available as soon as all patients display two-year follow-up from randomization unless an event (relapse  death or lost to follow-up) occurs earlier.DisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements  which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

I think that started to stabilise last year "" he said.""The values that have been raised in the market has increased quite a lot so that gives good confidence that there's bigger companies coming to the market raising more capital "" he added.There is also anticipation that some of the rapidly growing - but currently private - AI companies could start to come to market - sparking a sharp rise in activity.OpenAI is reportedly eyeing a $1 trillion IPO this year  and if that is a success  others could follow suit.""I think there's been a lot of kind of private equity backed large firms for many years at this stage "" he said.""They've gone through a couple of cycles of various investors of private equity and we're now starting to see hopefully that these companies need an exit  they need to return money to their shareholders  their investors "" he said.""So we'd hope to begin to see if we've got one or two good IPOs in the first quarter  you could see quite a number of large private companies come to the market  particularly in the US "" he added.Mr McAleavey said that the hope would be that a few flotation successes would give other firms the encouragement to launch IPOs of their own.Most of that activity is likely to be US and Asia-based  though.The EY data shows that the bulk of the IPO activity in 2025 was in the US  Hong Kong and India - with China and Japan also accounting for a large number of deals.However European deals are grouped within the ""other"" category  showing how low the level of activity is here.""There's probably a lot of older  industrial-type companies in Europe  a lot of them kind of bigger owned  family owned businesses "" he said. ""Where I think you probably see it in the US it's been a lot of technology companies  particularly in India as well  where that has driven the volume there.""I think Europe is a little bit behind  definitely  but I think it's driven by the technology  particularly out of the US.""For the Irish Stock Exchange  meanwhile  the focus is on trying to hold onto the companies that are already there.Last year Dalata was the latest firm to leave Euronext Dublin  following the likes of CRH  Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment and Smurfit Kappa (now Smurfit Westrock).And while PTSB may join that list of departees in the near future  Mr McAleavey said there have been efforts to ensure the stock exchange does not get too much smaller.""They've launched a new programme  the Access Market  where we saw one company list pre-Christmas  Seenas  a software company "" he said. ""So I think that is giving companies an alternative channel to private equity or to debt that you can raise  even if you're not a large cap.""In the US you take a view that you probably need to be north of a $1 billion valuation before you can take a US listing  whereas this is designed specifically for smaller companies who need capital to grow and scale "" he added.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,positive,0.61,0.39,0.0,True,English,"['IPO values', 'volumes', 'EY', 'latest EY Global IPO Trends report', 'bigger owned, family owned businesses', 'private - AI companies', 'The EY data', '1,293 initial public offerings', 'corporate finance partner', 'Paddy Power owner', 'older, industrial-type companies', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'two good IPOs', 'large private companies', 'one company list', 'latest firm', 'EY Ireland', 'bigger companies', '$1 trillion IPO', 'private equity', 'IPO volumes', 'good confidence', 'software company', 'large firms', 'IPO activity', 'large cap', 'smaller companies', 'recent years', 'Fergal McAleavey', 'sharp rise', 'many years', 'first quarter', 'Mr McAleavey', 'flotation successes', 'other firms', 'Hong Kong', 'other"" category', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Smurfit Westrock', 'near future', 'new programme', 'alternative channel', '$1 billion valuation', 'technology companies', 'large number', 'various investors', 'European deals', 'market sentiment', 'Access Market', 'US listing', 'world', '39% increase', 'values', 'numbers', 'upheaval', 'capital', 'anticipation', 'OpenAI', 'others', 'suit', 'kind', 'stage', 'couple', 'cycles', 'exit', 'money', 'shareholders', 'hope', 'encouragement', 'bulk', 'India', 'China', 'Japan', 'level', 'focus', 'Dalata', 'likes', 'CRH', 'PTSB', 'departees', 'efforts', 'Christmas', 'Seenas', 'debt', 'view', 'scale']",2026-01-09,2026-01-10,rte.ie

Photograph: PA Media/SpaceXInitial public offerings (IPO) raised $171.8 billion (€148 billion) globally last year  an increase of 39 per cent on 2024  despite the number of completed deals remaining essentially flat throughout the year  EY Ireland has said.New analysis from the Big Four accounting firm indicates that the IPO market finished on a stronger footing after a rebound in the third quarter of 2025.The fourth quarter of the year was the strongest in value terms since the final quarter of 2021  with $60 billion raised. Some 381 deals were recorded in the quarter  also making it the strongest three-month period in volume terms since the fourth quarter of 2022  EY said.Industrials remained the strongest sector for public listings globally  while technology and “AI-aligned businesses” continued to attract premium interest  according to the report.Ireland also finished the year with what EY described as a “meaningful milestone”  when environmental software company Senus became the first company to list on Euronext Dublin’s Access market  a springboard platform for small and medium enterprises.Fergal McAleavey  EY Ireland corporate finance partner  said: “After years without domestic IPO activity  the combination of targeted Government measures  including the stamp‑duty exemption for smaller Irish‑listed companies  and Euronext Dublin’s work to establish a simplified ‘springboard’ market has created a more practical pathway for early‑stage and scaling businesses to consider going public.”Ireland’s record tax take makes light of Trump tariffs fear Listen | 49:42He said that while the pipeline for Irish IPOs remains “modest”  the “underlying fundamentals are encouraging”.“With recognised strengths in fintech  medtech and AI‑enabled innovation  Irish companies that prioritise readiness will be well placed to step forward as confidence continues to build in 2026 ” Mr McAleavey said.At a European level  the number of IPOs fell 20 per cent to 105 in 2025  while the total amount raised fell 10 per cent to $17.3 billion  EY said.The decline is largely attributed to “competition between public and private markets  where companies are staying private longer due to ample dry powder in the private sector”  the firm said.Looking ahead  Mr McAleavey said that 2026 is shaping up to be a “pivotal year” for global capital markets.“With companies like SpaceX  OpenAI and Anthropic actively exploring possible IPOs – each with the scale to command tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars – the market could see one of the most significant cycles of large‑cap technology listings in over a decade ” he said.“This wave of activity could create opportunities for other businesses considering an IPO  but standing out will require more than ambition.”The Financial Times reported last week that Elon Musk’s rocket maker SpaceX and artificial intelligence labs OpenAI and Anthropic are working on listings expected to raise tens of billions of dollars in proceeds  according to multiple people with direct knowledge of their plans.,positive,0.55,0.45,0.0,negative,0.01,0.33,0.66,True,English,"['Global IPO market', 'big year', 'strong footing', 'EY', 'EY Ireland corporate finance partner', 'Big Four accounting firm', 'large‑cap technology listings', 'smaller Irish‑listed companies', 'The Financial Times', 'stamp‑duty exemption', 'record tax take', 'AI‑enabled innovation', 'ample dry powder', 'artificial intelligence labs', 'environmental software company', 'global capital markets', 'Initial public offerings', 'strongest three-month period', 'domestic IPO activity', 'Irish companies', 'first company', 'private markets', 'public listings', 'Irish IPOs', 'Elon Musk', 'rocket maker', 'PA Media/SpaceX', '39 per cent', 'New analysis', 'stronger footing', 'strongest sector', 'premium interest', 'meaningful milestone', 'Euronext Dublin', 'springboard platform', 'medium enterprises', 'Fergal McAleavey', 'Government measures', 'practical pathway', 'early‑stage', 'Trump tariffs', 'underlying fundamentals', 'Mr McAleavey', 'European level', 'total amount', 'private sector', 'significant cycles', 'multiple people', 'direct knowledge', 'third quarter', 'fourth quarter', 'final quarter', 'Access market', 'springboard’ market', 'AI-aligned businesses', 'possible IPOs', 'other businesses', 'IPO market', 'volume terms', 'pivotal year', 'Photograph', 'increase', 'number', 'deals', 'rebound', 'value', 'Industrials', 'report', 'Senus', 'years', 'combination', 'work', 'light', 'pipeline', 'strengths', 'fintech', 'medtech', 'readiness', 'confidence', 'decline', 'competition', 'OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'scale', 'tens', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'decade', 'wave', 'opportunities', 'ambition', 'proceeds', 'plans']",2026-01-09,2026-01-10,irishtimes.com
