Avalanche is trading at a key support zone as analysts debate trend continuation  Chainlink is facing renewed price pressure during fading ETF inflows  while Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is gaining visibility through a $5M Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) reward campaign tied directly to its presale auction.Taken together  these developments highlight how capital currently rotates between established layer one networks  mature infrastructure protocols  and early stage projects experimenting with alternative incentive frameworks. As larger assets are evaluated on price structure and institutional flows  newer entrants such as Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) are being examined through the lens of participation design and early access mechanics  a recurring theme across new crypto presales.Avalanche Tests Structural Support as Market Weighs Trend ContinuationAvalanche is trading near the $13.50 to $14.00 region  a zone that has formed as a key structural base following recent volatility. Analysts tracking price action note that AVAX has reclaimed $13.50  an area that has repeatedly acted as support since early 2024. Current trading reflects a tug of war between buyers attempting to defend this range and sellers testing downside conviction.From a technical perspective  holding above $13.50 keeps the short term structure constructive. A sustained breakdown below this region would reopen downside risk toward the $12.80 to $12.50 range  where prior demand has appeared. On the upside  acceptance above $14.80 could expose AVAX to a recovery toward the $16.50 to $17.50 resistance band  an area that previously capped advances.Beyond charts  on-chain data has strengthened the broader narrative. Avalanche recently surpassed $1 trillion in cumulative token volume  reflecting sustained network activity. In addition  more than 43% of all C Chain transactions recorded to date occurred in 2025 alone. Historically  periods where usage growth outpaces price have preceded longer term repricing rather than immediate breakouts  adding context to the current Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction debate.Chainlink Price Pressured as ETF Demand Cools Despite Strong FundamentalsChainlink price has come under pressure after retreating for several consecutive sessions  coinciding with fading demand for exchange traded products tied to LINK. The token has dropped to around $13  placing it more than 50% below its August highs  while market capitalization has declined to roughly $9.3 billion.Data indicates that the Grayscale Chainlink ETF has seen no inflows in recent days  bringing cumulative net inflows to approximately $63.3 million. Monthly inflows have slowed significantly compared with prior periods  raising questions about near term institutional appetite. Other altcoin focused ETFs  including those tied to XRP and Solana  have attracted substantially larger inflows since launch  leaving Chainlink products comparatively underrepresented.Despite ETF softness  several fundamentals remain constructive. Exchange balances of LINK have continued to decline  while the Chainlink strategic reserve has expanded  including a recent purchase of over 87 000 LINK. The protocol has also deepened its role in real world asset tokenization through partnerships with Swift  Euroclear  JPMorgan  and UBS. Still  technical patterns such as a bearish pennant and resistance below key moving averages suggest near term downside risk for Chainlink price remains elevated.Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Creates Massive FrenzyZero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is drawing attention through a participation focused incentive structure linked directly to its presale auction. A Gleam competition allocating $5M worth of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is currently active  designed to reward contributors who engage during the early distribution phase rather than passive observers.Participation requirements include holding at least $100 worth of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)  completing defined engagement steps  and optionally referring others. Referral mechanics have been structured to allocate 20% of rewards to the referrer and 10% to the referred participant  creating a compounding participation model rather than dilution. Ten winners are set to receive $500 000 USD worth of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) each.The campaign operates alongside the presale auction  which remains the only live phase of the project. There are no implications of broader network availability  and messaging consistently emphasizes early commitment and verifiable contribution. This framing places Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) within ongoing discussions around how early access is structured across new crypto presales.Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) positions its approach as building through proof rather than promotion. By tying presale incentives to measurable actions and referrals  the project is being evaluated on how effectively it aligns early participation with long term community formation  a factor increasingly scrutinized by market observers.Closing AnalysisAvalanche and Chainlink illustrate the challenges faced by established protocols operating in uncertain market conditions. Avalanche is dealing with a technically critical base that may determine its next directional move  while Chainlink faces near term pressure as ETF demand cools despite strong infrastructure fundamentals.In contrast  Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is being assessed primarily through its presale auction mechanics and incentive design. With $5M USD worth of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) allocated through a Gleam competition focused on participation  attention remains on how early engagement models influence visibility and commitment ahead of later phases.Explore Zero Knowledge Proof:Auction: https://auction.zkp.com/Website: https://zkp.com/X: https://x.com/ZKPofficialTelegram: https://t.me/ZKPofficial,neutral,0.01,0.87,0.12,negative,0.0,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['Zero Knowledge Proof', 'Chainlink ETFs Gain', 'Talking Point', 'AVAX Steadies', 'ZKP', '$500,000 Giveaway', 'Coverage', 'current Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction debate', 'Other altcoin focused ETFs', 'real world asset tokenization', 'near term institutional appetite', 'participation focused incentive structure', 'near term downside risk', 'early stage participation models', '$5M Zero Knowledge Proof', 'alternative incentive frameworks', 'longer term repricing', 'short term structure', 'early stage projects', 'layer one networks', 'mature infrastructure protocols', 'new crypto presales', 'key moving averages', 'A Gleam competition', 'compounding participation model', 'key structural base', 'sustained network activity', 'C Chain transactions', 'several consecutive sessions', 'broader network availability', 'cumulative net inflows', 'early distribution phase', 'cumulative token volume', 'Chainlink strategic reserve', 'early access mechanics', 'Grayscale Chainlink ETF', 'fading ETF inflows', 'key support zone', 'ZKP) reward campaign', 'Current trading', 'price structure', 'participation design', 'Participation requirements', 'technical structure', 'institutional demand', 'institutional flows', 'downside conviction', 'early commitment', 'Structural Support', 'sustained breakdown', 'broader narrative', 'ETF Demand', 'fading demand', 'ETF softness', 'several fundamentals', '$5M worth', 'Referral mechanics', 'live phase', 'price action', 'Chainlink Price', 'Monthly inflows', 'larger inflows', 'distinct reasons', 'trend continuation', 'presale auction', 'larger assets', 'newer entrants', 'recurring theme', 'Avalanche Tests', 'Market Weighs', 'recent volatility', 'technical perspective', 'prior demand', 'chain data', 'usage growth', 'immediate breakouts', 'Strong Fundamentals', 'August highs', 'market capitalization', 'recent days', 'recent purchase', 'technical patterns', 'bearish pennant', 'Massive Frenzy', 'passive observers', 'engagement steps', 'Ten winners', 'verifiable contribution', 'ongoing discussions', 'presale incentives', 'measurable actions', 'price pressure', 'market attention', '$13.50 to $14.00 region', '$12.80 to $12.50 range', '$17.50 resistance band', 'prior periods', 'Chainlink products', 'Exchange balances', '$100 worth', 'participants', 'analysts', 'visibility', 'developments', 'lens', 'area', 'tug', 'buyers', 'sellers', 'upside', 'acceptance', 'recovery', 'advances', 'charts', 'addition', 'date', 'context', 'questions', 'XRP', 'Solana', 'launch', '87,000 LINK', 'role', 'partnerships', 'Swift', 'Euroclear', 'JPMorgan', 'UBS', 'contributors', 'others', 'rewards', 'referrer', 'dilution', 'implications', 'messaging', 'framing', 'approach', 'promotion', 'referrals']",2026-01-12,2026-01-13,punchng.com

The transaction was previously announced in September 2025 and has now closed following customary clearance.UCP is based in San Diego and has strong positions in hormones and urology  alongside a solid compliance record. The business is highly complementary to Anazao and supports Fagron’s strategy to build a nationwide platform in the United States  spanning both 503A (patient specific) and 503B (outsourcing) services.The acquisition also strengthens Fagron’s position in California  one of the largest and most tightly regulated healthcare markets in the United States  where licenses are difficult to obtain.As previously disclosed  the enterprise value of the acquisition is c.$41.5 million  with annual revenues of around $25 million and an EBITDA margin below Fagron’s existing group margin. Fagron expects to realise synergies over the next 18 to 24 months as the business is integrated into its operations.Over recent months  Fagron has executed fourteen acquisitions across all regions  with selective expansion into Asia-Pacific. Injeplast  MagiLab  Vepakum and Amber remain pending closing.Rafael Padilla  CEO of Fagron  commented:“Completing UCP is another concrete step in building a scaled  high-quality compounding platform in the United States. UCP adds attractive therapeutic depth  brings a strong compliance track record  and fits well alongside Anazao as we strengthen our footprint from coast to coast across both 503A and 503B.Across the Group  we have strengthened our positions in core markets  expanded selectively into attractive new geographies  and added capabilities that deepen our vertical integration. We will remain selective and focused on execution as we integrate these businesses and continue to build a larger  higher-quality platform.”Financial calendar12 February 2026 Full year results 20259 April 2026 Trading update first quarter 202611 May 2026 Annual General Meeting 202530 July 2026 Half year results 20268 October 2026 Trading update third quarter 2026Results and trading updates are published at 7.00 AM CET.Further informationIgnacio ArtolaGlobal Investor Relations LeaderTel. +34 670385795ignacio.artola@fagron.comAbout FagronFagron is the leading global company active in pharmaceutical compounding  focusing on delivering personalized medicine to hospitals  pharmacies  clinics  and patients in more than 35 countries around the world.The Belgian company Fagron NV is based on Venecoweg 20A in Nazareth and is listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Amsterdam under the ticker symbol ‘FAGR’.

Team Wendy Ceradyne  a leading US-based developer and manufacturer of advanced combat helmets for the Department of Defense  and Theon International Plc (THEON)  a global company specializing in electro-optical systems including night vision  thermal imaging  and augmented reality (AR) technologies  have announced a strategic partnership under a US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Soldier Center (SC)-funded initiative. Together  the companies are developing a next generation Integrated Multi-Threat Headborne System (IMHS) designed to enhance Soldier protection  situational awareness  and lethality across multi-domain operations.“With Army support and strong industry partnerships  we're advancing head protection into a fully integrated helmet system - combining ballistic protection with enhanced situational awareness ” said Erik Cobham  President of Team Wendy Ceradyne. “This shift fundamentally changes how Soldiers perceive  decide  and respond on the battlefield.”Conducted under a shared-cost model between the US government and industry partners  the program integrates Team Wendy Ceradyne’s proven ballistic protection technologies with Theon’s advanced electronic systems. The result will be a modular head-borne architecture capable of delivering tailored  mission-critical technologies – including seamless communications integration – adaptable to future operational requirements.“We are honored to partner with the exceptional Team Wendy Ceradyne on this critical US Army initiative ” said Dr. Michalis Kolotos  Director of US Operations for THEON. “This collaboration is a prime opportunity to integrate our advanced THEON NEXT optro-electronic solutions  which are a direct result of our technological know-how and our strategic investments in the US. We are focused on delivering head-borne power and data solutions that could enable next-generation capabilities  such as advanced day-and-night Head-Up Displays (HUDs) and Augmented Reality (AR)  all seamlessly connected to the soldier's Power and Battle Management System. This integration is key to enhancing situational awareness and decision-making for the US warfighter”.The DEVCOM SC-sponsored team also includes Invisio  providing lightweight tactical communications and hearing protection  and Revision  contributing ballistic and laser protective eyewear. The IMHS prototype developed in this project will be evaluated by the DEVCOM Soldier Center in Fourth Quarter  FY26  during a Soldier Touchpoint to assess performance and gather user feedback for future design phases.For inquiries  please contact:Investor RelationsNikos MalesiotisE-Mail: ir@theon.comTel: +30 210 6772290 Media ContactElli MichouE-Mail: press@theon.comTel: +30 210 6728610About THEON GROUPTHEON GROUP of companies develops and manufactures cutting-edge night vision and thermal Imaging systems for Defense and Security applications with a global footprint.

The European Commission has approved Teizeild (teplizumab) to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adult and pediatric patients eight years of age and older with stage 2 T1D. This follows the positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Teizeild is the first T1D disease-modifying therapy approved in the EU  marking a significant milestone in the treatment of this progressive autoimmune disease. The approval is based on positive results from the TN-10 phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT01030861) demonstrating that Teizeild delayed the onset of stage 3 T1D by a median of two years compared to placebo  in adults and children aged eight years and older with stage 2 T1D.“We are pleased that  for the first time  we will be able to offer patients and families in the EU a disease-modifying therapy designed to address the underlying immune process of type 1 diabetes ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines  Sanofi. “We remain committed to working with external stakeholders across the EU to bring patients the benefits of Teizeild  a unique therapy that may prevent the natural progression of type 1 diabetes by protecting beta-cell function.”At the end of the TN-10 phase 2 study  the proportion of patients who remained in stage 2 T1D was almost twice as high in the Teizeild group as in the placebo group (57% vs 28%). The safety profile was consistent with the one observed in previous studies of Teizeild. The most frequently observed adverse events were blood or bone marrow-related (transient lymphopenia) in 75% of the participants and dermatologic or skin-related (rash) in 36% of the participants.Teizeild (known as Tzield outside the EU) is also approved in the US  the UK  China  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in adults and children aged eight years and older with stage 2 T1D. As previously communicated  following the positive CHMP recommendation for this newly approved indication  Sanofi has decided not to progress with a second application for Teizeild in recently diagnosed stage 3 T1D at this time. Next steps are under evaluation. Other regulatory reviews are ongoing.About TN-10The pivotal TN-10 phase 2 study was a randomized  placebo-controlled  double-blind study which evaluated Teizeild for the delay of stage 3 T1D in adults and children aged eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D (presence of at least two T1D-related autoantibodies and dysglycemia) who are relatives of people living with autoimmune T1D. Seventy-six participants aged eight to 45 were enrolled (Teizeild n=44  placebo n=32). They were randomized to receive a single 14-day course of either Teizeild or placebo.The primary endpoint was the elapsed time from randomization to the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune stage 3 T1D (progression from stage 2 T1D to stage 3 T1D). Key secondary end points included safety and tolerability.Results demonstrated that the median time to the diagnosis of stage 3 T1D was 48.4 months in the Teizeild group and 24.4 months in the placebo group. The disease was diagnosed in 19 (43%) of the participants who received Teizeild and in 23 (72%) of those who received placebo. The hazard ratio for the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (Teizeild vs. placebo) was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.78; p=0.006 by adjusted Cox proportional-hazards model). There were expected adverse events of rash and transient lymphopenia.About TeizeildTeizeild (teplizumab) is a CD3-directed monoclonal antibody. Teizeild is the first and only disease modifying therapy in autoimmune T1D; it was approved in the US in November 2022 to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and children eight years and older diagnosed with stage 2 T1D. Today  it is also approved in the UK  China  Canada  Israel  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  and Kuwait for the same indication. Other regulatory reviews are ongoing.About autoimmune T1DT1D is a progressive autoimmune disease where the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels is impacted due to the gradual destruction of insulin producing beta cells by one’s own immune system. There are four stages to the progression of T1D:In stage 1  the autoimmune attack to the beta cells has started  and this can be detected by the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies in the blood. During stage 1  blood sugar levels are in a normal range (normoglycemia). At this stage  T1D is presymptomatic.In stage 2 (also presymptomatic)  in addition to the presence of 2 or more T1D-related autoantibodies  blood sugar levels are now abnormal (dysglycemia) due to the progressive loss of beta cells / beta cell function.Stage 3 (also known as clinical stage) comes once a significant portion of the beta cells have been destroyed. At this point  rising blood sugar levels reach the point of clinical hyperglycemia (which defines diabetes)  and many people will start to experience the classic symptoms that come with the onset of stage 3 T1D: increased thirst  frequent urination  unexplained weight loss  blurred vision  and generalized fatigue. Management of stage 3 T1D requires daily and burdensome insulin replacement therapy.Stage 4 is defined as long-standing autoimmune T1D  often accompanied by evidence of chronic diabetic complications  where little to no beta-cell function remains (it’s been estimated that beta-cell mass is reduced by up to 95%). At this point  the T1D-related autoantibodies might not be present anymore in the blood  as most beta-cells have been rendered useless by the autoimmune attack.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.

Perhaps this will be the fall of the savage Islamic regime of the Mullahs of Tehran  which does not even require Trump to lend a hand: after so much violence and oppression over 50 years  the people are in the streets  the dead according to international sources are already in the hundreds  and it now seems difficult for Khamenei to endure. Now  what will happen afterward… here is where things get difficult  because as you will remember  after the Arab Spring came the hell of ISIS. Still  we seem to be heading toward the fall of the Iranian regime  even if in a second phase. More difficult for us Europeans will be Trump’s other great “occupation ” the conquest of Greenland  even if by buying out its inhabitants—unbelievable  right? Greenland formally belongs to Denmark  you see  therefore it is in some way EU territory  so there things become complicated for us as Europeans. We will have an exceptionally interesting year in 2026 with all this  but let us not forget that President Trump’s imperium will be tested (this year as well)  because there are midterm elections in the U.S.  so it will become clear whether his momentum will be cut short or not.Farmers – K.M.On domestic matters  Mitsotakis left for Madrid  where today he will meet with Pedro Sánchez on a visit that I do not know  beyond protocol  why it is happening now  although a similar one between the two heads of government last took place about 13 years ago. He will return in the evening to meet with our honored farmers on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion  where logically the issue will also be closed  since  as we said  in a few days the real farmers—not those who will go to Maximos—begin work in the fields.Report on the airport blackoutWithin the week  the report of the Committee investigating what happened at the beginning of the month  when the communication system between airports and airplanes went down  is also expected. My source says they are almost certain it was a hardware failure—in plain Greek  that the system broke down because it is ancient. If what happened is what seems almost certain  Mitsotakis has  in my opinion  one thing to do: cancel whatever tender is running (or almost running…) and bring in an urgent piece of legislation for reasons of national security and citizens’ safety  with direct assignment to whoever has such systems  guided by speed and technical competence. Nothing less or more. And what Dimas says  that the upgrades will be completed by 2028  I hear as a huge mistake  without of course blaming the minister  who has not been there for more than a year.The office visit and Tragakis’s daughterLet me convey two snapshots from K.M.’s visit on Saturday afternoon to the ND offices on Piraeus Street on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his election to the leadership. The first thing the prime minister did upon arriving was to take the elevator up to his office on the third floor of the building  where he will obviously return during the pre-election period of 2027. Otherwise  there were greetings and short huddles  while the “lifelong” Giannis Tragakis was walking arm in arm with his daughter  Argyro Tragakis  who is destined for the ballot of Piraeus B. Indeed  Tragakis’s daughter has also had a relevant meeting with K.M. for weeks now.President Nikos  the unmoving needle  and Pavlos’s evictionAnd we move on to PASOK matters  where the unmoving needle is driving MPs and party officials crazy  day in and day out—those who want to claim a parliamentary seat but see no progress on the “green” horizon. The percentages remain stuck and disappointing  mainly in the electoral districts of Attica  where the appearance of Alexis makes President Nikos’s life even more difficult. Tsipras has his own “little problems” in the region  where Karystianou is entering the game with… momentum—if the momentum turns out  of course  to be of… Popi (that pre-election 2023 moment when Tsapanidou saw something that citizens did not see in SYRIZA’s dynamics)  the former prime minister may hope that the times will turn (in his favor). President Nikos  on the other hand  sees the dream of second place in the basin drifting away and being lost  slowly but steadily. Even if the ranking order of ’23 is simply repeated  PASOK will once again see the back of the KKE and end up in fourth place. The current MPs  apart from the unmoving and single-digit needle  also have to contend with new “players” entering their area. Diamantopoulou decided to run in South Athens aiming for first place  since one seat for PASOK is considered certain  the one secured last time by Pavlos Christidis. President Nikos was also a candidate in southern Athens  but preferred to keep the seat in Thessaloniki A and push out Haris Kastanidis. Now? The “nice” thing is that some hard-core Androulakis supporters  who take for granted the candidacy of President Nikos (without a preference vote) in some district of Attica  do not rule out any scenario—even the one that has Androulakis running in Athens A. With one seat for PASOK  and if Androulakis keeps it  Pavlos Geroulanos will be left out… It is an extreme scenario and yet it is circulating  and if nothing else it describes the… fierce intentions of the presidential camp against their intra-party opponents. The other scenario being heard says that Androulakis will run “opposite” his intra-party rival  Manolis Christodoulakis  in East Attica. If he does not do so  he may field Nikos Milis and throw the entire party machine behind him  aiming at the methodical erosion of Christodoulakis’s momentum. A mess…President Maria…Otherwise  President Maria has properly entered the party’s trip  because I see and read that she now makes political statements wherever she stands and wherever she goes  one per day. Various people have appeared attaching themselves to Karystianou and praising her publicly  such as the pianist Farantouris  Zakri  who sees that Kasselakis might… leave politics and not know where else to go herself  and other desperate figures. She is undeniably the most interesting figure at the beginning of the new year because  despite what she said… as if something bit her  she decided to press the button and announced a party  whereas she could have waited. Some tell me she was convinced that Mitsotakis will allegedly call elections before the start of the Tempi trial. Everyone in the world can of course believe whatever they want  but K.M. is the last person to be thinking about elections  not even about a reshuffle. In the coming days  polling will also begin  and it will be interesting to see what Maria’s needle does as a party leader and not as the sympathetic mother of Tempi.The symbolism of Pierrakakis’s announcementOn Friday night  Kyriakos Pierrakakis announced  with his new capacity as president of the Eurogroup  the six candidates for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank. Among them were two names that were anything but unknown in Greece during the decade of the crisis: Olli Rehn and Mário Centeno  who are seeking a recommendation from the Eurogroup to the European Council  in a process that requires a 72% majority of eurozone member states. It is recalled that the Finnish politician served in 2010  at the outbreak of the crisis  as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (with the legendary “good luck” at the first memorandum)  while the Portuguese served as president of the Eurogroup in 2018  after Jeroen Dijsselbloem. And while Pierrakakis is not the only one responsible for their selection  still  it has its symbolism that it is the Greek finance minister who announces their candidacies.From transatlantic flights to RiyadhFor those who are watching  it does not go unnoticed that Stavros Papastavrou until today was almost a permanent passenger on planes heading to the other side of the Atlantic. Contacts in the U.S. consistently focused on an energy mix with fossil fuels at the center: hydrocarbon exploration with American giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and LNG imports. The minister has been in Riyadh since yesterday  making his first trip to an Arab country since taking office. Officially  his presence in Saudi Arabia is linked to a conference on critical raw materials. Behind the scenes  however  it is considered a given that during his stay there will be contacts with clear energy interest. Saudi Arabia has the rare triptych of capital  geopolitical weight  and strategic alliance—elements that are hard to ignore when major projects are on the table. At the center is the Greece–Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection  a high-demand project being worked on by ADMIE and National Grid  which aspires to open a new energy corridor between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. What is sought at this stage is not technical details  but whether and to what extent there is political and investment appetite to move forward. At the same table  a more cautious reference to an even more complex project may also be made: the Greece–Cyprus interconnection  especially given that interest from the Arab side is not unknown. It is recalled that in December 2023 Cyprus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned TAQA  with the participation of ADMIE  to promote investments in the Cyprus–Crete electricity interconnection. But with the project’s problems  all these agreements went out the window. It is no coincidence that  according to his interlocutors  Stavros Papastavrou often points out that the participation of investors from other countries in the share capital of the cable can contribute decisively to managing balances  especially in projects with complex geopolitical issues such as the GSI. Papastavrou will have bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of energy  Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud  and the minister of industry and mineral resources  Bandar bin Ibrahim Al Khorayef  as well as with executives of major Saudi groups operating internationally  including Dar Global  Quara Holding  and Alireza.Papastavrou–Eric Trump meetingAs part of the official visit mentioned above  which he has been making since yesterday in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia  Stavros Papastavrou met yesterday with Eric Trump  the second son of the President of the United States. Eric  together with his brother  is responsible for the Trump Organization  which is developing intense business activity in Saudi Arabia and more broadly in the Middle East. As part of his presence in the country  the minister was invited to and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new projects being implemented by the Trump Organization in Riyadh and Jeddah.Prayers did not reach the Supreme CourtThe well-known businessman Pantelis Mantonanakis  who invokes Saint Stylianos as his protector  found himself facing adverse developments. His prayers and efforts bore no result. With the recent decision AP 17/2026  the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos) rejected the application for annulment he had filed  through which he challenged the “abusive ” as he claimed  termination of his loans by creditors in 2019. This decision now leaves the way open for forced execution against his hotel units  which are entering the center of liquidation proceedings.Jumbo will also sell cigarettesJumbo decided to distribute an extraordinary cash dividend of €0.50 per share to its shareholders and for this reason is calling an extraordinary general meeting on February 4. There is  however  another issue to be discussed. It concerns the amendment of Article 4 (“Purpose”) of the company’s articles of association. What is changing? Jumbo decided that it will be able to sell tobacco products  including new tobacco products  electronic cigarettes  and all related smoking items. Other activities are also being added to the articles of association  such as the provision of storage and distribution services (logistics)  the production of electricity from photovoltaic systems  leasing and maintenance services for owned and leased properties not intended for residence  and the purchase and sale of owned real estate. Particularly the latter appears to be of great interest  and it remains to be seen what exactly it αφορά…Tiresias–Equifax: The cooperation still has a long way to goMajor projects have been launched at Tiresias. The first step was the conclusion of a strategic commercial partnership with Equifax  a leading global Credit Bureau specializing in data  analytics  and technological solutions for decision-making. Through this commercial partnership  Tiresias  whose CEO is Ilias Xirouchakis  will support businesses and financial institutions in credit-related decisions through cutting-edge technological systems that will utilize Tiresias’s reliable data. The cooperation with Equifax became possible because after three years Tiresias returned to profitability  and the beginning comes with the provision of four categories of products. It appears that Tiresias will soon move into advisory services  while expansion into other products is also planned. In the market it is said  without confirmation  that the two companies—as the cooperation matures—may move jointly abroad  something that possibly explains why a group of Equifax’s caliber took an interest in the Greek market of 20 million.HSBC: Warns of overheating of the Athens Stock ExchangeHSBC issued a clear warning about the overheating of the Greek stock market. In a report  the investment bank recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the Greek market in 2026. Put more simply  to start taking their profits  estimating that the strong rally of recent years (the General Index stands at +140% over the six-year period 2020–2025) has now exhausted the margins for further upside. HSBC stresses that the positive elements of the Greek economy—fiscal stability  improvement in bank indicators  and reforms—have already been priced into valuations  limiting future catalysts. At the same time  it aligns with other houses that argue that Greece’s transition from emerging to developed market status  although institutionally positive  may in the short term cause significant capital outflows  as several funds will be forced (also due to their statutes) to divest. HSBC warns that many Greek stocks risk losing their visibility in international indices  reducing investment interest. Overall  the bank sees 2026 as a year of increased risks and lower returns for the Greek market  with the risk–return balance deteriorating markedly compared to previous years.Agricultural electricity: The price of €0.085 cannot be reduced furtherThe price of electricity for agricultural use  through the GAIA tariff  has now definitively “locked in” at €0.085 per kilowatt-hour  with no possibility of further reduction. Sources with knowledge of the matter state that this price constitutes a final arrangement and cannot be readjusted  definitively closing the relevant discussion. Nevertheless  public debate continues with requests for additional reductions which  according to the available data  are not supported by economic or regulatory grounds. The assessment of the €0.085 price requires—as the same sources emphasize—examining the overall regime of charges and exemptions applicable to agricultural electricity  and not only the nominal kilowatt-hour price. According to calculations arising from the current framework for the tariff’s application  farmers are not burdened with transmission and distribution network usage fees (ADMIE  DEDDIE)  do not pay special consumption tax  and pay significantly reduced charges for Public Service Obligations (PSO) and ETMEAR (RES levy) compared to other consumers. The result is a real energy cost many times lower than that of household tariffs. In practice  if the net energy cost of a household consumer with a green tariff is indicatively depicted as “10 ” the corresponding cost for the agricultural tariff does not exceed “4.” This is a difference that places agricultural electricity in the lowest pricing tier among professional categories. A similar picture emerges from comparison with the Social Household Tariff B  under which approximately 300 000 beneficiaries fall. Based on current prices  farmers until now paid a comparable cost to beneficiaries of the social tariff. With the new price of €0.085  they will now pay less than the SHT  despite being a professional group that uses electricity to generate income and not as a measure of social protection. According to calculations based on average professional and household tariffs  agricultural electricity is today among the lowest-priced electricity for productive use  not only nationally but also at a European level. This picture arises both from nominal prices and from final charges after regulated fees. In this context  the issue of electricity cost is expected to be raised again at Tuesday’s meeting between the government and farmers  although—according to the same sources—there is no margin for renegotiating the price. The meeting may also be attended by the CEO of PPC  Giorgos Stassis  lending additional institutional weight to the process. With these δεδομένα  the agricultural electricity component appears to have essentially closed  with the discussion now shifting to the remaining open issues facing the farming community  from trade agreements and international competition to the broader structural challenges of the primary sector.One & Only Kea wants to expand – The reactionsThe file for the expansion of the One & Only Kea Island of the international Kerzner group on Kea is scheduled to pass this week through the review of the competent authorities of the Ministry of Culture  specifically the Central Archaeological Council  and it remains to be seen whether it will be a… walk in the park or not. This concerns the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) that has been submitted for increasing the capacity of the island’s five-star resort from 330 to 565 beds  along with a “redesign of the layout of the existing villas/bungalows” and “grouping accommodation into smaller ‘clusters’ of residences.” It is noted here that the sale of residences worth several million euros is being promoted by Dolphin Capital Partners of Miltiadis Kambouridis  which is also participating as an investor in the project. As noted in the EIS  “the units are organized into clusters of small hubs  with rows/clusters including 3–8 residences per group  in order to maintain a sense of dispersion and reduce visual mass compared to a large  compact development ” for a project that is also strengthened with additional infrastructure for wellness  sports activities  port facilities with the placement of floating platforms  additional swimming pools  expansion of the desalination unit  a helipad  etc. The EIS submitted for approval also refers to changes in volumes and heights in specific sections  with the maximum permitted height in certain zones increasing from approximately 7.5 meters to sections reaching 10.5–15 meters  serving “the integration of larger or two-story/modified units and auxiliary spaces ” with height changes characterized as critical “for visual intensity and for the footprint on the landscape.” For the expansion  however  indicative are the (not few) comments and objections during the consultation of the relevant EIS (completed in early December 2025) from local bodies and residents  who speak of significant strain on the island’s carrying capacity  unequal distribution of natural resources  disproportionately negative impacts on elements of the natural environment  etc. As noted indicatively  “according to data from the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels for the year 2023  the island had a total of 584 beds.” The creation of the Integrated Tourist Resort for One & Only Kea Island “initially increased this number by 56.5%  while the proposed modification with the additions will almost double the island’s original number of beds.” In addition  the new design does not take into account “the disproportionate burden on water consumption on the island during the summer months  which often reaches the point where prolonged interruptions in the municipal water supply network are observed  as well as phenomena of salinization and/or silty contamination ” while reference is also made to the “underestimation of helicopter flights and their impacts.”MovementCompetition is growing  good people are not lost  and thus Stavros Karagrigoriou  former CFO of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance)  is heading toward Minetta Insurance  within the framework of the insurer’s restructuring. S. Karagrigoriou remains one of the capable executives of the insurance market  has many years of experience in financial services  and joined the workforce of Ethniki Asfalistiki in 2016 assuming the role of CFO. Administrative changes at the company  within the framework of the new shareholder structure  resulted in his departure.Nicolas with the 27 ships and the $250 million cash pileContships Logistics  interests of Nicolas Pateras  once again confirms its strong position in the feeder containership sector  strategically and consistently exploiting the opportunities presented by the secondary market. The recent sale of five vessels to Medkon Lines and Metrostar Management brings more than $60 million into the company’s coffers  while the vessels are accompanied by existing charter contracts with major liner companies  ensuring their value and immediate returns. The company  which started in 2015 with a limited investment in the feeder sector  today has a fleet of 27 vessels with no debt  while cash reserves are expected to rise to approximately $250 million after the latest sales of the five vessels  which will be used for new investments. Nicolas Pateras has proceeded with ship sales at particularly profitable prices  taking advantage of the rise in the charter market  while at the same time renewing the fleet with newer vessels  without borrowing and with stable dividends for shareholders. Also significant is the return of Metrostar of Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos to the containership sector after approximately 15 years. The acquisition of two feeders from Contships marks its dynamic re-entry and its intention to exploit opportunities in this sector  demonstrating confidence in the quality of the Greek shipowner’s fleet and transactions. These moves confirm Pateras’s ability to manage the fleet and investments with consistency and strategic planning. Contships remains focused on fleet renewal  liquidity  and reliability toward major liner companies  while the market watches the entry of new players such as Metrostar  showing that the momentum of Greek shipping in containerships continues.Pistiolis and the sale of the mega yacht “San Lorentzo”The transfer of the under-construction mega yacht San Lorenzo  with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2027  by the U.S.-listed company TOP Ships is not a lifestyle issue  but a purely business decision. Evangelos Pistiolis chooses to remove from the company an asset that is not connected to its core role  namely tankers. Specifically  with the sale of the special purpose company to Rubico Inc.  which is the contracting party to the shipbuilding agreement for the newbuild vessel  for $38 million  TOP Ships “locks in” value and avoids future capital commitments until the vessel’s delivery in 2027. At the same time  it transfers to a third party the risk of delays or cost overruns in construction. For the market  the message is simple: management does not invest in assets that do not directly enhance revenues and the image of the listed company.DFC and the second disbursement for investments at the Elefsina shipyardsWithin February  the disbursement of the second tranche of the total $125 million loan from the U.S. state development bank  DFC  for the Elefsina shipyards is expected. At the same time  a visit by a bank delegation to Greece is planned  further strengthening the cooperation. ONEX is preparing to submit within the coming days the application for the second tranche  estimated at approximately $30 million  securing as collateral the two floating docks of Syros. Investments at Elefsina are progressing according to plan and timetable  with projects including  among others  the creation of new infrastructure networks  the renovation of gantry cranes  as well as the modernized renewal of electrical and mechanical installations. The progress of the works appears to be entering an accelerated pace  marking a critical phase for upgrading the shipyards and strengthening the Greek shipbuilding industry.Farmers’ roadblocks helped consumption in urban centersUnexpected assistance from farmers’ mobilizations was received by retail trade in major urban centers during the festive period. Christmas turnover reached €5 billion and conceals an asymmetric distribution: while the regions were bleeding  commercial shops (as well as food service) in major urban centers saw traffic and turnover increase. Difficulties in transportation trapped consumers who would have left for the regions for the holidays. At the same time  the cost of “last-minute” airline tickets abroad skyrocketed to prohibitive levels. The result was visible: thousands of Athenians and Thessalonians who would have been away remained in their cities and channeled their spending into the local market. Ermou Street  Aristotelous Square  and the malls experienced days of high footfall. Data from the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce show that 45% of businesses that significantly increased their turnover during the holidays are concentrated mainly in urban centers  while the regions paid the price of “trapped consumption.”A stock market of the few and the strongThe recap data of the fifth consecutive year of growth that led the Athens Stock Exchange into the embrace of Euronext reveal a market with a strong concentration of power in a few large players. In 2025  Piraeus Group Securities dominated with a 23.63% market share and transactions exceeding €240 billion. The top trio of brokerage firms is completed by Eurobank Equities (17.26%  €155 billion) and Euroxx (12.42%  €35 billion). Notable is the presence of Alpha Finance in fourth place (8.18%)  while National Securities follows with the same percentage  showing that the four systemic banks control nearly 62% of the market. UBS Europe (6.38%) in sixth place represents the international dimension of the market. From there downward  the picture shows a fragmented space with dozens of smaller players sharing percentages of 1% and below. In the new Euronext era  for a brokerage firm to be a Prime Broker it needs share capital from €5 million (for equities) to €10 million (for derivatives) and €100 million to operate in the bond market. The money required is substantial and the Greek market is small  making it difficult to sustain such sizes. Everyone is awaiting the first signs from the new president of ATHEX to trigger the inevitable developments.Progressive ATE saga: Shareholders’ G.M.  one day… after the hearingLate on Saturday night  the management of “Progressive ATE” informed its shareholders that the postponed General Meeting will take place on January 23. The date is not random  since one day earlier  on January 22  the interim measures filed by the main shareholder Chrysa Koutla (who appears to now control the company’s statutory minority) against the capital increase will be heard. It is obvious that the Board of Directors will request a new postponement from the Court in view of the “critical general meeting” the following day. The timetable betrays a strategy of continuous postponements on all fronts  while the Board knows it faces certain rejection. The situation is worsened by the emphatic absence of the Americans of LDA Capital Ltd from the entire process  despite the submission of a “Notice of claim” by the major shareholder  which remains unanswered. The contract with LDA Capital Ltd will be judged by the General Meeting of shareholders  while the invalidity of the extraordinary share capital increase of October 17 for their remuneration is expected to be decided judicially. All of this is quaint and interesting  while the case is being monitored by the Hellenic Capital Market Commission  as it had sent its officials to record the process of the postponed meeting.Mark Zuckerberg opened the nuclear energy floodgatesFriday will be recorded in economic history as a critical milestone for Wall Street. Meta Platforms officially confirmed that the artificial intelligence revolution has an energy problem  and the solution can be nothing other than nuclear energy. Meta Platforms’ agreements with Oklo  TerraPower (of Bill Gates)  and Vistra reveal the magnitude and scale of the problem. The data centers that power LLMs consume energy at levels that renewable sources cannot reliably cover. Nuclear energy offers the unique combination of high power  low emissions  and stable supply 24 hours a day  seven days a week. Wall Street reacted with an upward move of +1.2% in utility companies  but this probably does not reflect the full significance of the development. Utilities that for decades were “boring” dividend-yield stocks are transforming into swans of growth potential. Demand from AI data centers is creating a new cycle of infrastructure investments that could exceed $500 billion in the coming years. A +2.9% rally was also recorded in the Semiconductor ETF. Everything indicates that Wall Street “sees” an “energy bottleneck” that must be resolved soon. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence is not being restrained. Semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and AMD  as well as “semiconductor foundries ” that is  factories that manufacture chips on behalf of other companies such as TSMC  depend on the construction of new data centers. Data centers need energy. Oklo specializes in small reactors (Small Modular Reactors – SMRs). Meta has opened the nuclear energy floodgates. Amazon  Microsoft  and Google will follow with similar agreements. The race for dominance in Artificial Intelligence begins with who will secure reliable nuclear energy first.The restructuring of Commodity Indices will (temporarily?) pressure SilverAn extremely interesting week begins in the precious metals market. The restructuring of Commodity Indices  after the stunning upward trajectory of Gold and Silver prices  will reveal their true dynamics. Goldman Sachs published a chart revealing a striking divergence in the precious metals market since 2022. While central banks accumulated approximately 3 600 tons of gold  Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (Gold ETFs) recorded net outflows of more than 1 000 tons. When Russian assets were frozen in 2022  mass gold purchases by central banks began  while the first Fed rate cut in 2024 marked a new phase. Emerging economies avoid transactions in dollars  trade in local currencies  and “lock in” exchange rates with gold. Geopolitical tensions fuel demand for “safe investment havens.” Silver  on the other hand  faces a different reality. Its hybrid nature (50% safe haven and 50% essential industrial metal) makes silver vulnerable to abrupt moves. Gold is driven by central bank purchases. Silver is affected by algorithmic trading as well as the green transition (which requires silver). The coming days will show the true dynamics.,neutral,0.0,0.92,0.08,negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,True,English,"['Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting', 'report', 'blackout', 'Riyadh', 'Jumbo', 'cigarettes', 'permits', 'hard-core Androulakis supporters', 'savage Islamic regime', 'other great “occupation', 'Pedro Sánchez', 'lifelong” Giannis Tragakis', 'former prime minister', 'Iranian regime', 'U.S.', 'cinematic manner', 'American army', 'international stage', 'international sources', 'Arab Spring', 'second phase', 'EU territory', 'interesting year', 'midterm elections', 'K.M.', 'domestic matters', 'similar one', 'two heads', 'airport blackout', 'hardware failure', 'plain Greek', 'one thing', 'urgent piece', 'national security', 'direct assignment', 'technical competence', 'huge mistake', 'a year', 'two snapshots', 'Saturday afternoon', 'ND offices', 'Piraeus Street', '10th anniversary', 'first thing', 'third floor', 'pre-election period', 'short huddles', 'Piraeus B.', 'relevant meeting', 'President Nikos', 'party officials', 'green” horizon', 'electoral districts', 'little problems', 'other hand', 'ranking order', 'single-digit needle', 'new “players', 'South Athens', 'southern Athens', 'Haris Kastanidis', 'nice” thing', 'Argyro Tragakis', 'second place', 'fourth place', 'first place', 'honored farmers', 'real farmers', 'unmoving needle', 'parliamentary seat', 'one seat', 'many days', 'Maximos Mansion', 'communication system', 'citizens’ safety', 'current MPs', 'Pavlos Christidis', 'President Trump', 'PASOK matters', 'office visit', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'seizure', 'Maduro', 'something', 'fall', 'Mullahs', 'Tehran', 'violence', 'oppression', '50 years', 'people', 'streets', 'hundreds', 'Khamenei', 'things', 'hell', 'ISIS', 'Europeans', 'conquest', 'Greenland', 'inhabitants', 'Denmark', 'way', 'imperium', 'momentum', 'Mitsotakis', 'Madrid', 'protocol', 'government', 'evening', 'Tuesday', 'issue', 'work', 'fields', 'Report', 'week', 'Committee', 'beginning', 'month', 'airports', 'airplanes', 'opinion', 'tender', 'legislation', 'reasons', 'systems', 'speed', 'Dimas', 'upgrades', 'course', 'daughter', 'occasion', 'leadership', 'elevator', 'building', 'ballot', 'eviction', 'progress', 'percentages', 'Attica', 'appearance', 'Alexis', 'Tsipras', 'region', 'Karystianou', 'game', 'Popi', 'Tsapanidou', 'SYRIZA', 'dynamics', 'times', 'favor', 'dream', 'basin', 'back', 'KKE', 'area', 'Diamantopoulou', 'candidate', 'Thessaloniki']",2026-01-12,2026-01-13,en.protothema.gr
