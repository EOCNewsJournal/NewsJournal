The application has been granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of May 10  2026.“Patients living with seronegative gMG continue to face limited treatment options and there remains a significant need to meaningfully improve their lives. The FDA’s acceptance of our sBLA with Priority Review status reflects the potential of VYVGART to address this need ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “This development brings us closer to expanding the use of VYVGART in a broad spectrum of patients with myasthenia gravis. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the FDA as they review our application.”The sBLA is supported by data from the Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adults with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG across all three subtypes – MuSK+  LRP4+  and triple seronegative gMG. The study met its primary endpoint (p-value=0.0068)  demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score compared to placebo after four weeks.In the overall population  mean change from baseline in patients treated with VYVGART was a clinically meaningful 3.35 point improvement in MG-ADL total score at week 4. Improvements in MG-ADL and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores were observed across subsequent treatment cycles in the overall population and in all patient subgroups  including MuSK+  LRP4+  and triple seronegative gMG.VYVGART was well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the established profile of VYVGART in patients with AChR-Ab seropositive gMG and other indications. No new safety concerns were identified.ADAPT SERON Study DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adults with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG (n=119) across North America  Europe  China  and the Middle East. Part A randomized participants (1:1) received 4 once-weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV or placebo  followed by a 5-week follow-up and primary analysis. Part B is an open-label extension: participants receive 2 fixed cycles of 4 once-weekly efgartigimod infusions (4-week interval between cycles); from cycle 3 onward  additional cycles could be started ≥1 week after the last administration of the previous cycle  based on clinical status. The primary endpoint is the MG-ADL total score change from baseline to day 29 in part A. Other scales of evaluation include QMG  MG-QoL 15r  MGC  and EQ-5D-5L VAS. Enrolled participants had a confirmed MG diagnosis by an independent panel of experts  and an MG-ADL total score of 5 or greater. Participants were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs. Participants were eligible to enroll in ADAPT SERON if they were AChR-Ab seronegative  which included participants who are MuSK-Ab seropositive  LRP4-Ab seropositive  or triple seronegative.MG-ADL is a validated measure of disease activity in patients living with myasthenia gravis  which evaluates the functional impact of symptoms on daily activities such as speaking  chewing  swallowing  breathing  and limb strength.About AChR-Ab Seronegative Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare  chronic  neuromuscular autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic IgGs targeting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission and debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Approximately 80% of patients with gMG have detectable antibodies against the AChR in sera  and these patients are diagnosed as AChR-Ab seropositive gMG. Approximately 20% of patients with gMG do not have detectable serum antibodies directed against AChR and are referred to as AChR-Ab seronegative gMG. These patients may have detectable autoantibodies targeting other NMJ proteins  such as muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4)  or others. Anti-MuSK antibodies are detected in approximately 1-10% of patients with gMG  while anti-LRP4 antibodies are detected in approximately 1-5% of patients with gMG. About 10% of patients do not have any detectable autoantibodies against AChR  MuSK or LRP4. These triple seronegative patients have historically been excluded from studies and have a higher disease burden and unmet medical need compared to patients with detectable autoantibodies. Currently  there are no approved treatments available for patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies or for triple seronegative patients.Important Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.

The new order follows a previous batch of 100 satellites announced in December 2024  bringing the total number of second generation OneWeb spacecraft on contract with Airbus to as many as 440 units.The satellites will be produced on a newly installed production line at Airbus Defence and Space facilities in Toulouse  France  with initial deliveries scheduled to begin by the end of 2026. Establishing a dedicated line in Europe enables Eutelsat and Airbus to industrialize the build of the new constellation elements while maintaining tighter control over schedule  quality and supply chain resilience.Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation currently operates more than 600 satellites in 12 synchronized orbital planes at an altitude of about 1 200 kilometers  providing global high speed  low latency connectivity. The incoming satellites will progressively replace the earliest spacecraft in the constellation as they reach end of operational life  ensuring uninterrupted services across fixed  mobile and government connectivity markets.The new spacecraft incorporate upgraded technology  including advanced digital channelizers that significantly enhance onboard processing power and flexibility. These digital payloads will allow more efficient use of spectrum and dynamic allocation of capacity to match changing traffic patterns  improving overall network performance and resilience for users.Airbus and Eutelsat have optimized the satellite architecture to maximize long term operational performance  focusing on reliability  maintainability and in orbit longevity. The design aims to sustain Eutelsat's LEO services well into the next decade while leaving room for incremental enhancements as components and software evolve.Eutelsat plans to use the refreshed platform to explore new business opportunities  particularly through hosted payload capabilities that could support additional missions or services on board the satellites. Such hosted payloads could include specialized communications packages  space situational awareness sensors or other government related applications  leveraging the reach and revisit of the OneWeb orbital planes.Fully oriented toward the professional business to business market  Eutelsat's OneWeb network is one of only two fully operational low Earth orbit broadband systems in service worldwide and the only one operated by a European based company. This position gives Eutelsat a strategic role in providing sovereign grade connectivity options for European and allied governments seeking diversified  secure satellite communications solutions.The LEO system complements Eutelsat's fleet of 34 geostationary satellites  which together with the low Earth orbit constellation form an integrated GEO LEO architecture created when Eutelsat and OneWeb combined in 2023. The combined infrastructure supports four main verticals: video distribution  mobile connectivity  fixed connectivity and government services  using space and ground assets to deliver tailored solutions worldwide.Eutelsat Chief Executive Officer Jean Francois Fallacher said the new Airbus order underpins the growth trajectory of the OneWeb business  which delivered about 80 percent topline expansion in 2025. He said the additional satellites will secure continuity for a growing base of customers and distribution partners who rely on the low latency LEO capacity for critical connectivity needs.Alain Faure  Head of Space Systems at Airbus Defence and Space  said the contract reinforces Airbus's long standing relationship with Eutelsat  which spans more than three decades across multiple satellite programs. He described the deal as a strong endorsement of Airbus's design and manufacturing capabilities for large scale LEO constellations and confirmed the company's commitment to supporting the evolution of the OneWeb system.Eutelsat positions the expanded LEO constellation as a key asset for meeting rising global demand for broadband and resilient communications in remote and underserved regions  over land  at sea and in the air. By combining GEO and LEO capacity  the operator aims to offer flexible  scalable services that can address commercial and government requirements  including defense  emergency response and critical infrastructure support.The company emphasizes that its connectivity services are designed to be safe  resilient and environmentally responsible  with a commitment to helping bridge the digital divide. Eutelsat employs more than 1 600 staff in over 75 countries and is listed on both Euronext Paris and the London Stock Exchange under the ticker ETL  reflecting its broad international footprint and investor base.Related LinksEutelsatRead the latest in Military Space Communications Technology at SpaceWar.com,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,True,English,"['340 new OneWeb LEO satellites', 'Eutelsat', 'Airbus', 'two fully operational low Earth orbit broadband systems', 'Eutelsat Chief Executive Officer Jean Francois Fallacher', 'diversified, secure satellite communications solutions', '340 OneWeb low Earth orbit satellites', 'low Earth orbit constellation', 'long term operational performance', 'large scale LEO constellations', 'sovereign grade connectivity options', 'low latency LEO capacity', 'next generation constellation plan', 'space situational awareness sensors', 'other government related applications', 'second generation OneWeb spacecraft', 'integrated GEO LEO architecture', 'long term service continuity', 'low latency connectivity', '340 new OneWeb LEO satellites', 'long standing relationship', 'specialized communications packages', 'multiple satellite programs', 'expanded LEO constellation', '12 synchronized orbital planes', 'global high speed', 'changing traffic patterns', 'overall network performance', 'four main verticals', '80 percent topline expansion', 'rising global demand', 'London Stock Exchange', 'broad international footprint', 'OneWeb orbital planes', 'The LEO system', 'critical connectivity needs', 'new constellation elements', 'Such hosted payloads', 'critical infrastructure support', 'advanced digital channelizers', 'government connectivity markets', 'supply chain resilience', 'flexible, scalable services', 'new business opportunities', 'Space Systems', 'new Airbus order', 'operational life', 'European based company', 'satellite architecture', 'OneWeb constellation', 'tailored solutions', 'new spacecraft', 'resilient communications', 'OneWeb network', 'OneWeb system', 'LEO services', 'new order', 'OneWeb business', 'next decade', 'Related Links', 'digital payloads', 'fixed connectivity', 'connectivity services', 'earliest spacecraft', 'government services', 'government requirements', 'combined infrastructure', 'digital divide', 'professional business', 'business market', 'mobile connectivity', 'incoming satellites', '34 geostationary satellites', 'government customers', 'new contract', 'Erica Marchand', 'previous batch', 'total number', 'production line', 'initial deliveries', 'dedicated line', 'tighter control', 'uninterrupted services', 'upgraded technology', 'processing power', 'efficient use', 'dynamic allocation', 'incremental enhancements', 'payload capabilities', 'strategic role', 'allied governments', 'video distribution', 'ground assets', 'growth trajectory', 'growing base', 'distribution partners', 'Alain Faure', 'three decades', 'strong endorsement', 'manufacturing capabilities', 'key asset', 'underserved regions', 'emergency response', 'investor base', 'Space facilities', 'additional satellites', 'additional missions', 'Airbus Defence', 'Euronext Paris', '100 satellites', '600 satellites', 'France', 'SPX', 'Jan', 'manufacture', 'commercial', 'December', 'many', '440 units', 'Toulouse', 'build', 'schedule', 'quality', 'altitude', '1,200 kilometers', 'onboard', 'flexibility', 'spectrum', 'users', 'reliability', 'maintainability', 'longevity', 'design', 'room', 'components', 'software', 'platform', 'reach', 'revisit', 'position', 'fleet', 'Head', 'deal', 'commitment', 'evolution', 'remote', 'land', 'sea', 'operator', 'defense', '1,600 staff', '75 countries', 'ticker', 'ETL']",2026-01-13,2026-01-14,spacewar.com

The review will cover all levers available to enhance the company’s performance  including business portfolio  operational footprint and route to market  with a clear goal to improve cash generation and return on investment. A Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors will be established to accelerate the review  facilitate decision-making and ensure careful oversight over the execution of Ontex’s medium- and long-term plans.To strengthen the Board following the resignation of Mr. Jesper Hojer  the Board has co-opted Mr. Lorenzo Grabau as a non-executive director and will submit his ratification at the next shareholders’ meeting. Mr. Grabau brings extensive capital markets and strategic transformation expertise that will be invaluable as Ontex continues to execute its strategic and value creation agenda. Mr. Grabau has considerable experience as director and chair of  and senior advisor to  various listed and non-listed companies. He served as President and CEO of Kinnevik AB  a Swedish listed investment company. Prior to that  he was a Partner at Goldman Sachs.These initiatives reflect the Board’s commitment to pursue all avenues available to deliver value creation to Ontex’s shareholders.EnquiriesInvestors: Geoffroy Raskin +32 53 33 37 30 investor.relations@ontexglobal.comMedia: Catherine Weyne +32 53 33 36 22 corporate.communications@ontexglobal.comAbout OntexOntex is a leading international developer and producer of baby care  feminine care and adult care products  both for retailers and healthcare  primarily in Europe and North America.

IPN60340 is an investigational first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting BTN3A  a key immune-regulatory molecule broadly expressed across cancer. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions with evidence of a substantial clinical improvement. IPN60340 previously received Orphan Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in July 2025.“This Breakthrough Therapy Designation recognizes both the urgent need for new treatment options for people living with acute myeloid leukemia and the promising data seen so far in the development program for IPN60340 ” said Christelle Huguet  PhD  EVP and Head of R&D  Ipsen. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA as we advance to the next stage of clinical development and continue to deliver medicines with the potential to be transformative to people living with cancer.”This Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on data from the Phase I/II EVICTION trial. Updated clinical data orally presented at the American Society of Hematology (n=57)1 from the EVICTION trial showed treatment with IPN60340 in combination with Ven-Aza achieved very encouraging high responses. In this single-arm trial  treatment with IPN60340 and Ven-Aza (n=38)  resulted in a near doubling of the complete response relative to those seen in historical standard of care data across all molecular subtypes in newly diagnosed patients including sub-types typically less responsive to standard of care (Ven-Aza).1 2 IPN60340 in combination with Ven-Aza was also shown to be well tolerated  underscoring IPN60340’s potential as a novel immunotherapy to improve outcomes for patients with AML. Based on these preliminary data  we look forward to discussing the design of the Phase II/III development plans with the FDA for IPN60340 in H1 2026.About the EVICTION trialEVICTION is a first-in-human  dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort-expansion (Part 2) clinical trial of IPN60340 (ICT01) in patients with various advanced relapsed or refractory solid or hematologic cancers that have exhausted standard-of-care treatment options  as well as newly-diagnosed AML. More information on the EVICTION trial can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04243499).About IPN60340 (ICT01)IPN60340 is a humanized  anti-BTN3A (also known as CD277) monoclonal antibody that promotes the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by γ9δ2 T cells  which are responsible for immunosurveillance of malignancy and infections. The three isoforms of BTN3A targeted by IPN60340 are overexpressed on many solid tumors (e.g.  melanoma  urothelial cell  colorectal  ovarian  pancreatic  and lung cancer) and hematologic malignancies (e.g.  leukemia and lymphomas) and are also expressed on the surface of innate (e.g.  γδ T cells and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells). Binding to BTN3A is essential for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response of γ9δ2 T cells. By altering the conformation of BTN3A  IPN60340 promotes this binding  thereby selectively activating circulating γ9δ2 T cells. This leads to migration of γ9δ2 T cells out of the circulation and into the tumor tissue  and triggers a downstream immunological cascade through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines  including but not limited to IFNγ and TNFα  further augmenting the anti-tumor immune response. Anti-tumor activity and efficacy of IPN60340 have been shown in patients across several cancer indications. IPN60340 is an investigational therapy under evaluation for people 75 years or older living with acute myeloid leukemia who due to comorbidities are prevented from receiving treatment with intensive chemotherapy.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The results va…,Sidetrade  the Order-to-Cash AI company  announced it has obtained SOC 1® Type II and SOC 2® Type II reports with an unmodified auditor’s opinion  following audits conducted by EY France  and completed a full ISO/IEC 27001:2022 recertification. The results validate the company’s control maturity  data protection practices  and operational resilience at scale  as enterprises increasingly demand verifiable assurances on AI governance and financial process integrity  particularly in regulated environments.The SOC (System and Organization Controls) reporting framework provides independent assurance on the design and operating effectiveness of controls over time. Following audits conducted by EY France  Sidetrade received SOC 1® Type II and SOC 2® Type II reports with an unmodified auditor’s opinion  confirming that its internal controls were suitably designed and operated effectively throughout the audit period.Notably  these results were achieved while Sidetrade integrated acquisitions  expanded its global footprint  and introduced new agentic AI capabilities  indicating a level of control maturity capable of absorbing structural and technological change without degradation.In parallel  the ISO 27001:2022 full recertification confirms the continued effectiveness of Sidetrade’s Information Security Management System (ISMS)  aligned with international best practices  with no material nonconformities recorded. Sidetrade has been ISO 27001 certified since 2019.According to Laurent Pontier  Sidetrade CTO Chief of Staff: “Achieving these SOC1  SOC2 and ISO 27001 results  while scaling rapidly and introducing new agentic capabilities required a disciplined  cross-functional operating model  and I’m incredibly proud of the teams involved. Security and compliance at Sidetrade are designed as proactive control layers  developed to remain robust as our products  AI architecture and market conditions evolve.”A trust signal for regulated and US-based enterprisesFor enterprises operating under Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) or equivalent regulatory regimes  SOC 1® Type II remains a core assurance mechanism  confirming that software supporting financial processes is governed by reliable and consistently applied  auditable controls. SOC 2® Type II  increasingly required by US enterprises during vendor due diligence  provides independent assurance over security  availability  and confidentiality controls across infrastructure and development operations.“AI at scale cannot be treated as an experiment. It must be governed  observable  and resilient by design ” said Pontier. “The SOC reports reflect how we design our AI platform to meet the control standards expected in SOX-regulated environments. Trust is not declared. It is demonstrated  year after year.”Issued by EY CertifyPoint  Sidetrade’s latest ISO 27001 recertification adds a complementary layer of assurance  signaling a mature and embedded approach to information security governance. In 2025 Sidetrade transitioned to the latest version of the norm: ISO/IEC 27001:2022.AI platform and data sovereignty built into security frameworkWith AI central to Sidetrade’s platform  the company’s ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified ISMS scope explicitly includes its artificial intelligence systems  including Aimie  its agentic AI  alongside its core Order-to-Cash applications and services.Sidetrade’s SOC 1® Type II report covers controls relevant to customer-facing applications supporting financial processing  while the SOC 2® Type II report covers the organization’s controls across people  processes and technology  including operational processes and its software development lifecycle.While SOC reports do not provide AI-specific assurance  AI capabilities are developed and operated under the same standard development and security controls applied across Sidetrade’s platform.Since its inception  Sidetrade has taken a deliberate approach to sovereignty by operating its infrastructure  AI models and payment data within a controlled environment. This ensures full segregation of customer data and keeps it within  secure  controlled boundaries. The approach is designed to meet the highest standards of privacy  security and regulation  including GDPR.Preparing for the next regulatory waveThe audit outcomes also support Sidetrade’s preparation for emerging regulatory frameworks  including the EU AI Act  which is expected to increase formal expectations around risk management  transparency  and control design for AI companies such as Sidetrade.While SOC reports are distributed under NDA and ISO 27001 certification applies strictly to the defined ISMS scope  the combination remains a key trust signal for enterprises evaluating AI vendors in mission-critical financial workflows.As businesses accelerate AI adoption while tightening vendor oversight  Sidetrade’s latest audit outcomes position it among AI providers treating security assurance as continuous operational discipline rather than a marketing milestone.Find out more about Sidetrade’s commitment to effective governance and Corporate Social Responsibility here.Investor relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relations @SidetradeOli Thornton 00 44 7933 108 107 oli.thornton@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) is an AI company redefining how enterprises secure and accelerate cash flow.

We have said several times that Mitsotakis  being conciliatory on all levels and trying to exhaust every margin for agreement  has essentially gained points in the political game  whether he is facing professional groups  oligarchs  or intra-party opponents. With the farmers  however  things went too far and reached the end  at least with one category of them  who simply do not want to reach an understanding with the government for reasons that are now clearly political or partisan  or both  and in any case have nothing to do with their profession. I think that at this point the farce-tragedy should stop  the law should be applied  and we should be done with it. I am told that Mitsotakis himself has exhausted his margins and his patience. We will have a clearer picture today at noon  when the government  whatever happens and after meeting with the remaining representatives of the farmers  will announce whatever measures it has planned.Maria  Nikos  and Fan-Farandouris— I will take you back to government matters a bit later  but because I know the good topic you are interested in is that of President Maria  I’ll take you straight there. So  I told you from yesterday: Maria K. has much stricter face control at the door of her new shop than even Alexis  who doesn’t want to see even a SYRIZA cat in his new venture  regardless of the fact that in the end he will have difficulty finding people outside to staff it. Yesterday  the pianist Farandouris—or Fan-Farandouris  as they call him in SYRIZA—was outright turned away  despite his earnest efforts to squeeze into President Maria’s party. In fact  Karystianou made sure to generalize the matter and exclude anyone else  politician or MP  who has been exposed in politics up to now. Off the top of my head  in recent days I can recall people galore who have spoken in her favor  such as Theodora Tzakri  Nikos Nikolopoulos  Giorgos Kyrtsos  and a bit earlier Panaras Kammenos—so those people are finished… done for. Now  with whom President Maria will form a party  I do not know  but don’t think it’s difficult. I mean  how did Niki form a party and find MPs? Did you know any of them beforehand? Elias Kasidiaris with the Greeks? Even Kammenos himself  when he flourished in 2015  was not known even to the building’s doorman.Meeting with Erdoğan— Yesterday’s phone call between Gerapetritis and Fidan showed that we are closer to a Mitsotakis–Erdoğan meeting with ministers within the first half of February  as Ramadan begins afterward. Since K.M.’s schedule is very tight until the end of January  I would say the first days of February are more likely  but we’ll see. In the meantime  let me tell you that the prime minister’s new diplomatic adviser  the former ambassador to the U.S.  Katerina Nasika  has already appeared at the Maximos Mansion and is preparing to take over  as the current adviser  Milton Nikolaidis  is waiting for paperwork to depart for Paris.Tasoulas’s gift to Pierr— There was a lot of talk about Metsovo yesterday during the meeting at the Presidential Palace between Pierrakakis and Tasoulas—after all  the finance minister had been there on vacation over Christmas. After that  the President of the Republic gave Pierr a book titled “Evangelos Averoff  Letters to Michael Tositsas ” which contains his foreword  in which he describes the development model of Metsovo as it was shaped based on the funding of Michael Tositsas. Tositsas was an immensely wealthy baron of Metsovo origin who lived permanently in Switzerland  but he was so prominent and held such a dominant position in high European society of the early 20th century that Marcel Proust mentions him in the monumental “In Search of Lost Time.” The sharp-witted Metsovite Averoff identified him and  through letters  convinced him to donate a large part of his fortune to Metsovo—about 4 million dollars  in 1950 prices.Marinakis’s jab over Mercosur— Because much was said over the weekend about how… dramatic the Mercosur agreement is for Greece  yesterday spokesman Marinakis clarified that the agreement includes clauses protecting many PDO products. He even highlighted that PASOK’s MEPs voted against the core provisions of the agreement  which include exports and quality safeguards for products  contrary to the line of the European Socialists  who supported it overall  while yesterday Spain’s Sánchez also praised it during his meeting with K.M. Marinakis was answered by PASOK spokesman Tsoukalas  who said that the party’s MEPs put the national interest first  but did not explain why  for example  the French or Polish European Socialists supported Mercosur.A north wind blowing from the south— Yesterday the news from Thessaloniki must have landed heavily at Charilaou Trikoupi. A well-known figure  a long-time local government official  parliamentary candidate (he came second after Haris Kastanidis)  and member of PASOK’s Central Committee  Antonis Saoulidis  will be the number one speaker at Alexis Tsipras’s event this coming Saturday at the Olympion cinema in Thessaloniki. Saoulidis was among the main supporters of Androulakis for the leadership election in 2021; in 2024 he supported Haris Doukas for leader  and now  it seems  he is preparing—on the occasion of “Ithaca”—to begin the journey with Tsipras. Contacts were made during the holidays and Saoulidis shook hands  and thus on his name day  Saturday  January 17  he will be receiving birthday wishes from his friends (nice  that…) at the Olympion. In PASOK’s leadership  however  he had already sent the messages—it has been a while since he participated in an event for the broad Center-Left with Olga Gerovassili in Kozani  when MPs originating from SYRIZA  Rania Thraskia and Petros Pappas  began touring Saoulidis’s area  Thessaloniki A’  under the PASOK banner. Saoulidis  green from the cradle  tells his friends that fragmentation harms the Center-Left and that progressive collaborations are needed. How does the well-known lyric from the song of the late Thessalonian Nikos Papazoglou  “Lemon on the Orange Tree ” go  referring to strong winds that overturn realities? A north wind blows from the south…Familiarity  influence  and shadows over the Cyprus–Crete interconnection— The video that circulated in recent days and is causing a political earthquake in Cyprus does not merely concern individuals and private conversations. It concerns the way power is exercised or influenced  especially on issues of strategic importance  and inevitably creates associations with complex projects such as the Cyprus–Crete electrical interconnection. In the controversial material  the director of the Cyfield Group  Giorgos Chrysokhoos  appears to describe with impressive ease and familiarity his relationship with the President of the Republic of Cyprus  Nikos Christodoulides. He speaks of direct communication  of regular meetings  of a relationship that—as he implies—does not pass through institutional filters and is not publicized “so as not to create impressions.” And it is precisely this familiarity that has caused rumors to run rampant  becoming the subject of discussion and commentary even within government circles. Because once close personal access to the highest level of power is recorded  even indirectly  all of Mr. Chrysokhoos’s public interventions take on different weight and a different reading—especially those concerning the Cyprus–Crete electrical cable. It is no coincidence that in Nicosia  but now also in Athens  statements made from time to time by the head of Cyfield about the interconnection are resurfacing with intensity: about excessive cost  questionable viability  flawed energy strategy  and the risk of burdening consumers. Positions that were anything but supportive of a project with a clear geopolitical and energy dimension. Until recently  these interventions could be attributed to a legitimate  albeit clearly interest-driven  business perspective. Today  however  after the video  they cannot be viewed in isolation from the context. Because Cyfield is simultaneously promoting large-scale investments in thermal power generation  projects whose economic rationale is directly weakened by a successful electrical interconnection with Greece. The question  as energy sector figures comment  is not whether Mr. Chrysokhoos had the right to disagree with the cable. He did. The question is whether this disagreement coexisted with informal  personal  and privileged access to the President—and whether this access contributed  even indirectly  to political delays  vacillations  and a lack of a clear line on a project of national importance.Visit of Goldman Sachs to Athens— Last week  analysts from Goldman Sachs who cover Greek banks were in Athens. One could say it was a meet-and-greet  as within the broader upgrade of the stock market  coverage of Greek banks by the American investment bank will from now on be carried out by analysts in London rather than those in the periphery (Dubai  etc.)  as had been the case until now. It is an interesting change prompted by overall developments in the Greek stock market  the acquisition of ATHEX by Euronext  and the data of Greek banks  which changed the level and coverage needs. The change also indicates a different investment interest from larger investment organizations. What happened with Goldman Sachs will also happen with other investment banks that covered our country from the periphery  especially insofar as 2026 is expected to bring an MSCI upgrade for the Greek stock market.METLEN’s strategy in defense— At METLEN’s Capital Markets Day in London  it was said that “from two factories we are going to five by 2028–30.” At the time  this intention was received by many with reservations and doubt. Nine months later  the factories have become six—and in full operation—at the Volos Hub. This is not a box-ticking exercise  but a correct reading of demand in the European defense industry  which accelerated the plan while simultaneously providing a sample of management’s credibility. Management’s assessment is that  as happened in the previous fifteen-year period  those who will remain standing are those with the know-how and scale to work directly with major international defense groups. The partnerships METLEN is developing with major players (e.g.  IVECO Defence Vehicles  KNDS) ensure access to product lines  specifications  and production rates that increase Greek added value. The Volos Hub is being built precisely to “plug into” this. NK Trailers—which Metlen acquired for €10 million and in which it will invest another €30–40 million—has a long track record and significant expertise both in the production of defense systems and in train wagons  a sector of great interest in the context of modernizing the railway network  wagons  systems  etc. The Volos-based industry  which began in 1993 as a subsidiary of Nik. Kioleïdis AEBE  is implementing the ambitious project of fully refurbishing 14 trainsets of Metro Line 1  in partnership with Spain’s CAF and STASY. Today  its production base extends over 27 000 sq. m. in Volos  with modern production lines. With this move  Metlen’s M Technologies Hub in Volos now consists of six independent factories  while the budget of Metlen Metallurgy’s defense arm  under which the Volos defense Hub falls  foresees a doubling of turnover and operating profitability in 2026 compared to 2025.New record label by Argyros and Panik— A new company entered the artistic scene yesterday. It is Pedagon Records  founded by the popular singer Konstantinos Argyros and Panik Entertainment Group  the well-known group of interests of Paris Kasidokostas-Latsis and Giorgos Arsenakos. The new company has a very broad purpose  which includes (indicatively) the production of all kinds of sound carriers or sound-and-image carriers  such as compact discs  CD-ROMs  digital discs (compact discs)  digital video discs  magnetic tapes  CDs  DVDs  and generally phonograms or sound recordings and/or audiovisual works in commercial and/or technological form  or in whatever other form may exist in the future; the incorporation and circulation of recorded songs and performances; and the carrying out of recording  reproduction  and commercial exploitation of sound recordings  possibly assuming the financial responsibility for their realization. It also includes services for the commercial promotion  projection  and support of these works. Furthermore  the recording of musical works  visualization  and generally the recording of performances/interpre­tations of artists using any modern recording method  extending even to DJ services.The company’s headquarters are located in the municipality of Vari–Voula–Vouliagmeni  specifically on Vouliagmenis Avenue  in the building of Panik Entertainment Group. As for the initial share capital  it amounts to €90 000  divided into 10 000 corporate units of capital contributions  with a nominal value of €9 each. Of these  the company Argy Productions (of Konstantinos Argyros) paid €54 000 in cash and received 6 000 corporate units (a 60% stake)  while Panik Entertainment Group paid €36 000 in cash and received 4 000 corporate units (a 40% stake). The management of the company  as well as its judicial and extrajudicial representation  was entrusted to Konstantinos Argyros and Giorgos Arsenakos.The relocation of Astir— With the start of the new year  as I am told  there was also a relocation of the headquarters of “Astir Palace Vouliagmeni ” that is  the company that owns and manages the emblematic Astir complex. Specifically  following a relevant decision taken at the General Assembly of shareholders on December 15  2025  the headquarters of “Astir Palace Vouliagmeni Single-Member S.A. Hotel Company” moved from Apollonos Street in the municipality of Vari–Voula–Vouliagmeni  and the (new) headquarters were designated as the municipality of Glyfada  specifically at Diadochou Pavlou St. no. 5  Poseidonos Avenue no. 10  and Ethnikis Antistaseos St. no. 2. This is the block that overlooks the Glyfada seafront. It should be noted that Agency Trust Ltd  a shipping company of interests of Liza Prokopiou  daughter of the powerful shipowner Giorgos Prokopiou—who  as is known  has also acquired the Astir complex—is also based on Ethnikis Antistaseos Street.Kopelouzos’s bonus— In another company  Damco Energy of the Kopelouzos family  I learned that management dipped into its pocket and gave bonuses to employees. In the relevant document filed with GEMI  however  reference is made to a decision taken by the General Assembly in December 2024  but it may be a typographical error and December 2025 may be intended. In any case  following a proposal by the Chairman and CEO of Damco Energy  Christos Kopelouzos  and “taking into account the contribution of the company’s employees to its affairs ” the General Assembly unanimously decided to distribute profits to them totaling €361 540.81  in accordance with the provisions of the company’s articles of association. As clarified  “the above distribution will be paid from profits of previous fiscal years based on an annex that details the employees  each one’s specialty  and the amount allocated to each.” Don’t expect that everyone is… Karelias  but it’s something.Tzirakian found a lifeline in… mortars— For many months  the management of Tzirakian Tube Works was trying to restructure its debts  breathe financially  and start a new course. It seems that increased defense spending is creating a development clearing for the company  perhaps because mortars require steel tubes that Tzirakian can manufacture. The company announced that it reached an agreement with Piraeus Bank and doValue for a new four-year program to service loan obligations amounting to €5 million  with low annual installments  a favorable interest rate  and a balloon payment at maturity. Market information indicates that a similar agreement will be concluded within January with the National Bank as well. A significant development is considered the fact that while in the first quarter of 2025 Tzirakian recorded losses of around €600 000  this year the first quarter will be marginally profitable  outlining a new trajectory. Tzirakian’s market capitalization has now exceeded €5 million  that is  28% higher than levels a month ago.The battle for the Coast Guard shipbuilding program begins— One of the most ambitious defense procurement projects of recent years is entering the implementation phase  with the Ministry of Shipping  with steady support from the Maximos Mansion and the Prime Minister personally  giving the starting signal for the construction of the two largest offshore patrol vessels in the history of the Hellenic Coast Guard. The €180 million program is not simply another procurement  but a government choice of high priority  with strict timelines and zero tolerance for delays  objections  and familiar Greek blockages. The order for the tender “to run” leaves no room for misinterpretation—neither within the ministry nor abroad. At the end of February  the preselection of interested parties for the international tender begins  whether individual companies or joint ventures with shipyards. In the first phase  strict filters apply  namely technical and financial adequacy  to determine who truly has the capacity to undertake such a demanding shipbuilding program and who is merely interested for appearances’ sake.The two vessels  over 80 meters long  with a range of 4 000 nautical miles  operational capability in 7–8 Beaufort conditions  a helipad  and drone deployment capabilities  upgrade the Coast Guard’s level. And together  they change the game. It is no coincidence that the tender has mobilized every serious player domestically and internationally: Greek shipyards are declaring “present ” European giants are sharpening their pencils  and behind the scenes collaborations  joint ventures  and… creative discounts are already being set up. After all  everyone knows that these two vessels are not the end of the road  but the beginning. Coastal vessels  fast interceptors  and—if public finances allow—perhaps two more offshore floating beasts lie on the horizon. Within the ministry  the message is clear and politically charged: the tender must move quickly and without mishaps. The activation of the Strategic Contracts Unit is no coincidence  aiming to bypass delays and the well-known Greek pitfalls that in the past short-circuited projects before they even began.The port of Igoumenitsa and the political bet of the green transition— Igoumenitsa is the first Greek port to seriously embark on the path of green shipping  with the installation of Cold Ironing systems  which allow ships to shut down their engines and be supplied with electricity from shore. A move that reduces noise and emissions  but also opens a cycle of questions around electrical capacity  technical readiness  and political will. The project  to be implemented by HEDNO (DEDDIE) in cooperation with the Igoumenitsa Port Authority (OLIG)  is funded by the European Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) program and will operate on a pilot basis with three ship electrification points.Here lies the crux of the matter: Igoumenitsa  now under the control of the Grimaldi Group  is becoming a model  but for the technology to be extended to major ports such as Piraeus  Thessaloniki  and Rafina  coordination  serious infrastructure  and above all political will are required. The truth is that the transition to “green” shipping is not an easy undertaking. HEDNO has taken on the technical part  but securing the required power capacity remains an open issue  while shipowners will have to choose electricity providers and adapt to new procedures. At the same time  the expansion of Cold Ironing to seven major ports by 2030 shows that Greece does not want to lag behind the European commitments of “Fit for 55.”Koskinen – Veniamis in a critical term for the future of shipping— The official congratulatory letter of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) to the newly elected president of the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA)  the Finn Mikki Koskinen  and the also newly elected vice president Nikos Th. Veniamis is anything but routine. At a time when European maritime policy is hardening  the ICS  under the presidency of Emanuele Grimaldi  has chosen to send a clear message of institutional alignment with ECSA’s new leadership.The timing is critical. Decarbonization  increasing regulatory pressure  and geopolitical instability create an environment in which the balance between Brussels and international organizations is being tested. The emergence of Koskinen and Veniamis comes at a moment when ECSA is called upon to function not only as an interlocutor with the EU  but also as a filter against policies that threaten the competitiveness of European shipping. The presence of the ICS at the events marking ECSA’s 60th anniversary in Brussels carried clear symbolism: a reminder that  despite different starting points  major decisions cannot be taken in a fragmented manner. The reference to a “common voice” is not rhetorical  but a warning: without coordination  2026 risks finding the shipping sector fragmented in the face of policies drafted without maritime logic.Bank returns already in double digits in 2026— The January Effect is underway at the Athens Stock Exchange  which continues to exceed expectations. The General Index closed for the third consecutive session above the recent threshold of 2 200 points and remained at the highest levels of the past 16 years. Banks play a decisive role  keeping the ASE at record levels despite signs of fatigue appearing in the rest of the board. The banking index closed at a more-than-10-year high—specifically 122 months—with the next best close dating back to November 18  2015  at 2 713 points. Indeed  in the first six sessions of the current year it has already gained more than 10.5%.Alpha Bank is moving under the constellation of UniCredit’s increased participation  coming within a breath of €4 for the first time since November 2015. Eurobank also reached a 10-year high at €3.8. At the same time  Piraeus Bank recorded a new five-year high and is setting course for €8 for the first time since March 2021  while eyeing a €10 billion market capitalization. Although it has eased off the accelerator  National Bank is playing defense above €14  maintaining contact with its own peaks.Trump’s closest associate comes to Athens— Stephen Miran is chairman of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. He is the man Trump chose to place on the Federal Reserve Board to push toward rapid cuts in dollar interest rates. With a PhD in economics from Harvard  the former head of strategy at various hedge funds is considered an architect of President Trump’s tariff policy  and he has publicly questioned the independence of central banks.A few days before one year is completed since Trump’s return to power (January 20  2025)  Stephen Miran will be in Athens as a guest of the Delphi Economic Forum and  the day after tomorrow in the afternoon at the National Gallery  in the presence of ministers  bankers  and of course Ambassador Guilfoyle  he will present not only the balance sheet of a year that changed global trade  but—above all—the plans of the PotUS for the economic future of the planet.Snails in Berlin and Mr. Emaar— Let’s now step a bit beyond our borders to understand how fast other regions of the planet are moving and how Europe—if it does not change—will soon be reminiscing about its past glories. In Dubai  an emblematic conference took place  the 1 Billion Followers Summit  focusing on the “creator economy ” that is  the economy of digital content creators. It is one of the largest events in the world in this field and aims to bring together creators  brands  technology companies  and representatives of social media platforms.There spoke Mohammed Alabbar  whom some may not know  but they certainly know Emaar Properties  the company behind Burj Khalifa  Dubai Mall  and huge residential and commercial projects in the UAE  the Middle East  Europe  and Asia. The founder of Emaar  speaking at the conference that concluded the day before yesterday  argued that Europe  due to bureaucracy and excessive regulatory restrictions  is putting the brakes on economic growth and entrepreneurship  in contrast to the UAE  where development is more dynamic and business opportunities more favorable. He expressed the view that in Dubai people get rich… on autopilot because the environment (regulations  speed of decision-making  the state) favors success.He even revealed that when he tried to develop a residential complex in Berlin  where there is a huge housing shortage  the mayor said that first they had to study whether there would be impacts… on the snails living in the area. Alabbar replied  “you deal with the snails and let Germans sleep on the street…” and headed for other jurisdictions. Of course  to be fair  the Arabs are at the opposite extreme. In order to invest  they demand special treatment (e.g.  they wanted Ellinikon  but with a special tax regime—without VAT)  they do not understand tender procedures  and they want political solutions without the mediation of institutions  independent authorities  etc.When the President decides on credit card interest rates— With a simple announcement on social media  President Trump “announced” that starting next Tuesday  January 20  interest rates charged on all credit cards  regardless of debt level and borrower creditworthiness  will fall to 10%. He announced it on a Friday night so that the market could “digest” it over the weekend when stock markets were closed. Naturally  on Monday morning  the presidential “prompting” (because a president cannot decide credit card interest rates) caused an earthquake in banking stocks: Capital One fell 10% at the opening of Wall Street  Citigroup -4%  American Express -4%  and JP Morgan -3%.The “measure ” which is supposedly to apply from January 20 for one year  remains at the stage of a “prompting” without legislative backing. Five major banking organizations reacted immediately  warning that the cap would “reduce credit availability” and push consumers toward “less regulated alternatives.” Credit card charges in America reach as high as 30%  while credit card balances exceed $1.23 trillion. Of exceptional interest is the bipartisan consensus around the presidential “prompting.” The first to speak was the “leftist” Bernie Sanders  followed by Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Republican lawmakers such as Josh Hawley also applauded it. Even Elizabeth Warren (a fierce critic of Trump) said she was ready to cooperate  although she called the initiative “a joke” because Trump recently repealed the Biden rule on late fees.Bill Ackman  American billionaire hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management  a Trump supporter  called the measure “wrong ” warning of the cancellation of millions of high-risk cards. Later  however  he acknowledged the injustice: poor consumers subsidize the reward programs of the wealthy.Conclusion: Clearly  a legislative intervention is needed.
