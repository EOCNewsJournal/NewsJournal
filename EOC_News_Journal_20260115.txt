Data presented highlighted the depth and diversity of evidence across multiple movement disorders — including post‑stroke spasticity  cervical dystonia and blepharospasm  adding to the available evidence of Dysport®(abobotulinumtoxinA) in patient care – alongside new indications under evaluation.An interim analysis from the ongoing EPITOME study will be presented. EPITOME is a multi-country epidemiologic study following adults aged 18–85 after their first stroke  to better understand how often post-stroke spasticity (PSS) occurs and to better improve early identification. The study focuses on a Post-stroke Spasticity Monitoring Questionnaire  a remote monitoring tool designed to help clinicians detect early signs of spasticity.PSS can develop following a stroke and often goes undiagnosed  delaying treatment and limiting recovery. Remote monitoring can help clinicians act sooner  improving the potential for swift rehabilitation and better quality of life for patients. In this interim analysis  45.7% of stroke survivors with paresis developed spasticity within 1 year of their stroke vs previously documented 39.5% 3 reinforcing the value of monitoring within this period. Previously published real-world evidence and quality of life insights reinforce the existing care gap  with <1% of stroke survivors receiving BoNT-A treatment for spasticity in routine practice.2“We are proud to present this breadth of data which underscores our mission to bring solutions and address care gaps for people living with a broad range of neurological conditions ” said Sandra Silvestri  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Ipsen. “The EPITOME study is one example of this  focused on providing a standardized and best-practice follow-up to ensure people living after a stroke receive the care they deserve.”Complete list of Ipsen presentations at TOXINS 2026:Lead author Abstract title Zorowitz  R.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

THEON  along with other customers of Harder Digital  appreciates not only the ongoing improvements in both the quantity and quality of tubes but also the access to a different IIT technology. We expect Harder Digital to account for 8-10% of THEON’s target of €1 bn revenues by 2029-2030.”Closing of KAPPAOn 14 January 2026  THEON completed the acquisition of 100% of Kappa Optronics GmbH (KAPPA) for a cash consideration of €69.9 million  following the successful conclusion of all customary regulatory approvals. KAPPA is expected to contribute c.€40 million to THEON group revenues in FY 2026 (in line with the previously announced guidance) and to materially support the acceleration of THEON’s success in the Platforms-based market.Participation in U.S. Army - Funded InitiativeTHEON is partnering with Team Wendy Ceradyne under a U.S. Army DEVCOM Soldier Center - funded initiative to develop a next-generation Integrated Multi-Threat Headborne System (IMHS) prototype for the U.S. Army. The program combines proven ballistic protection with advanced opto-electronic systems  moving beyond standalone equipment toward a modular  fully integrated head-borne architecture designed for multi-domain operations. This collaboration enables the integration of THEON technologies  supporting advanced day- and night-time HUDs  augmented reality  and seamless connectivity to the soldier’s power and battle management systems. The prototype evaluation is planned for later in FY26.As Michalis Kolotos  Director of U.S. Operations at THEON  notes: “The focus is on delivering head-borne power and data solutions that enhance situational awareness and decision-making for the U.S. warfighter”.Joining the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)THEON has been accepted as a member of UNGC since January 6  2026. This milestone reflects THEON’s commitment to aligning with the Ten Principles of the UNGC  which include Human Rights  Labor  Environment  and Anti-Corruption.

54665,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4130433.html,ALL Accor unveils the 8 trends set to redefine experiential travel in 2026,In a world shaped by economic  social and environmental uncertainty  travellers are increasingly turning to travel as a way to self-regulate. Rather than accumulating things  they are collecting moments - seeking awe  joy and connection as antidotes to stress…,In a world shaped by economic  social and environmental uncertainty  travellers are increasingly turning to travel as a way to self-regulate. Rather than accumulating things  they are collecting moments - seeking awe  joy and connection as antidotes to stress and instability.ALL Accor (Accor's booking platform and loyalty programme) has partnered with global trend forecasting agency Globetrender to unveil the findings of its latest report on experiential travel in 2026. Based on an international study analysing the behaviours of thousands of travellers  the report identifies eight key trends - each linked to a distinct “vibe” - reflecting the aspirations of a generation in search of freedom  authenticity and emotional intensity. 25% of travellers would like their online search experience to start with 'mood'  underscoring a fundamental shift: travel is no longer defined by geography alone  but by how it makes people feel.You can find the full study by clicking here.8 TRENDS AND VIBES :ENDORPHIN ECONOMY – Vibe: aweHYPER PLAYGROUNDS – Vibe: joyPORTABLE LIFESTYLES – Vibe: libertySOCIAL WELLNESS – Vibe: connectionMEMORY LANES – Vibe: nostalgiaEARTH SYNCING – Vibe: serenityUNFILTERED JOURNEYS – Vibe: surprisePOINTS MAXXING – Vibe: prestigeThe essence of travel is evolving. As people seek deeper meaning and connection  emotions guide their journeys. This report shows Accor's commitment to understanding and shaping these new expectations. With ALL Accor  we are not just responding to these shifts. We are actively leading  leveraging a blend of human insight and strategic use of technology  including AI  to craft unique and deeply personal experiences across our brands that truly resonate with what our guests want to feel. Our focus remains on the guest  enriched by innovation. Alix Boulnois  Chief Digital and Tech Officer – AccorDeveloped through a hybrid methodology combining foresight analysis  qualitative research and quantitative data - supported by a 2025 consumer survey conducted by Dynata among 4 300 travellers across nine countries (France  Germany  the United Kingdom  the United States  Brazil  Australia  China  India and the United Arab Emirates) - ALL Accor and Globetrender bring the “Vibe Menu” to life  decoding eight emotional states set to reinvent the way people travel in 2026.“ENDORPHIN ECONOMY”Vibe: AweWhen awe brings fans from around the world together.More than just a holiday  travel becomes the pursuit of a heart-pounding moment - a suspended instant where collective energy and shared passion draw travellers together to feel something extraordinary. A decisive goal cheered by thousands of fans  an iconic concert experienced in perfect unison  an ovation that unites and transcends an entire crowd… 89% of travellers say that live events make travel truly worthwhile. Among the most sought-after experiences  concerts (1)  sporting events (2) and music festivals (3) stand out as the primary travel drivers of the Endorphin Economy.With ALL Accor  these emotions are experienced closer than ever: attending a concert from the secret speakeasy Somewhere Bar by Handwritten Collection at the Accor Arena; feeling the thrill of the Monaco Grand Prix from the balconies of Fairmont Monte Carlo; or staying at Pullman Dubaï Downtown in the one-of-a-kind Roland-Garros-branded rooms during the tournament itself.Designed as a new way to experience loyalty  ALL Accor places its members at the heart of their passions and everyday lives through a loyalty program granting access to more than 7 000 events each year across over 110 countries. Loyalty is no longer just about accumulating points - it becomes an emotional passport  unlocking access to truly unique experiences.“HYPER PLAYGROUNDS”Vibe: Joy'Hyper Playgrounds' reflect a deep-rooted need: to escape an everyday life that is hyper-rational  hyper-productive and over-optimised. In a world shaped by performance  screens and constant demands  travellers are seeking spaces where they can truly let go - not through stillness  but through play  surprise and sensory stimulation. 'Hyper Playgrounds' embody a new generation of immersive  multisensory and playful environments designed to delight the senses and spark joy.On ALL.com  this need translates into a curated selection of experiences crafted to deliver genuine dopamine hits and reignite the inner child - from interactive museums and escape rooms to immersive art galleries and boldly designed hotel settings. Among them: the opportunity to dine in the sky in Dubai  where a gourmet meal is served on a platform suspended 50 meters above the ground  offering panoramic views over the skyline and marina (18 302 ALL Accor Reward points).When it comes to playground destinations  Las Vegas stands as a perfect example. Previously absent from the Strip  Accor has recently made its debut with the integration of Treasure Island TI Las Vegas Hotel & Casino  Handwritten Collection on ALL.com.Beyond accommodation  travellers today are searching for true joy triggers: 31.5% say they are actively seek for hotels with bold or playful design  while 43% are drawn to high-concept restaurants with performative elements.“PORTABLE LIFESTYLES”Vibe: LibertyHospitality without compromise.In the era of remote work and hybrid lifestyles  'Portable Lifestyles' embody a new form of freedom: the ability to travel without giving up one's routines or reference points. Today  travelling no longer means leaving life behind but taking it with you. In fact  95% of travellers consider it important of travellers say it is important that they are able to maintain aspects of their usual lifestyle when travelling. Eating habits  work and fitness routines  wellness rituals and even pets have become 'portable'  allowing travellers to feel at home anywhere in the world.On ALL.com  this freedom takes shape through destinations designed to blend work  social connection and enjoyment. In Budapest  Hossegor and Rome  JO&JOE blurs the boundaries between hotel  coworking space and living hub  while WOJO offers flexible workspaces adapted to the evolving rhythms of nomadic work.As pets are increasingly considered full members of the family  travelling with them has become an obvious choice rather than a logistical challenge. At Mama Shelter Paris West  dogs enjoy dog-sitting services  bespoke birthday celebrations and treats  while Fairmont's “Very Important Pups” are pampered with personalised menus  custom photo shoots  spa treatments and even boat rides.“SOCIAL WELLNESS”Vibe: ConnectionHealth and healing are becoming collective experiences.In an era marked by growing loneliness  84.5% of travellers are seeking deeper  more direct connections with others  while 59% associate wellbeing with moments of shared conviviality. Travellers are swapping solitude for shared rituals  from group saunas and sunrise runs to meditations and summer camps  discovering that restoration feels richer when it's done together.Around the world  spas and hotels are transforming into true social spaces - places people visit as much to reconnect with others as to recharge. At ALL Accor  this new era of 'Social Wellness' comes to life through destinations where wellbeing becomes a collective experience. Far from the silence of traditional retreats  these spaces and wellness programmes encourage connection: at Sofitel Singapore Sentosa  the 6 000 m² So SPA features steam rooms  mud baths and shared rituals  with select evenings enhanced by outdoor screenings that transform the pool into an open-air cinema; in Miami  the “Library of Us” pop-up on the beach at Faena Miami Beach  held last December  invited guests to read and exchange ideas around a floating seaside library conceived by artist Es Devlin; while at Cures Marines Trouville Hotel Thalasso & Spa - MGallery  group Nordic walking sessions  guided breathing and collective meditation offer moments of genuine sharing  where wellbeing and connection - to oneself and to others - are fully experienced.“MEMORY LANES”Emotion: NostalgiaAs digital saturation and ephemeral content blur our moments of true presence  87% of travellers feel nostalgic for a time when life seemed more real  simpler and less digital  while 64.5% admit to often feeling overwhelmed by smartphones  notifications  constant photo-taking and social media sharing. Rather than submitting to this constant race for immediacy and visibility  travellers are now seeking tangible experiences  places rich in history and immersive atmospheres that rekindle memory and reconnect them with the simple pleasures of the past.In New York  The Plaza Hotel allows guests to relive an iconic moment of cinema with its famous 16-scoop sundae made legendary by Home Alone 2 - a true 1990s icon. Across the Atlantic  The Savoy in London  the first fully electrified hotel in the United Kingdom  offers a genuine journey through time: crystal chandeliers  polished wood and checkerboard floors immerse visitors in the splendour of the Belle Époque  while recalling the iconic figures who once stayed there  from Marilyn Monroe to Winston Churchill.In this way  'Memory Lanes' offer a nostalgic interlude where travel is not about escaping the present  but about rediscovering the authenticity of memories that time has not erased.“EARTH SYNCING”Vibe: SerenityAs seasons become increasingly unpredictable  59% of travelers report feeling disconnected from natural rhythms  and 69% have planned a trip specifically to experience a seasonal natural phenomenon (cherry blossom  autumn foliage  wildflower blooms  the Northern Lights  harvest season  wildlife migrations...). In this context  'Earth Syncing' embodies the desire to slow down  refocus  and reconnect with the Earth's pulse  offering a rare sense of serenity in an otherwise hyperactive daily life.At ALL Accor  this serenity is expressed through experiences that foster a reconnection with nature and oneself. Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge  nestled in the heart of the Canadian Rockies and within one of the largest star reserves in the world  offers open-air symphonic concerts - between mountains and lakes - as well as meditation sessions designed as true celestial performances  sometimes revealing the Milky Way and the northern lights.In France  two other hotels available on ALL.com invite guests to reconnect with nature: The Royal Monceau Raffles Paris  through painting workshops on the lawns of Parc Monceau  and Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay  where monastic life comes alive for a moment: collecting eggs on the farm  rowing on the pond  and wandering through ancient cloisters and forests… inviting travelers to slow down  embrace the moment  and let themselves be carried by the gentle rhythm of nature.“UNFILTERED JOURNEYS ”Vibe: SurpriseAs social media fatigue sets in  travellers are yearning to rediscover what algorithms have gradually erased: surprise. In a world where every restaurant is geotagged and every moment anticipated  ultra-planned trips leave little room for the unexpected. The result: 63.5% of travelers now avoid destinations considered too exposed or “overhyped ” while 82% prefer seeking advice from locals or people they meet along the way.This quest for authenticity gives rise to 'Unfiltered Journeys': trips lived without filters  where joy emerges from a spontaneous detour  a chance encounter  or a place discovered by accident. Far from rejecting digital tools  travelers use them to streamline logistics - entrusting planning to AI - to free up time and mental space for what truly matters: feeling  exploring  and allowing themselves to be surprised. Alix Boulnois  Chief Digital and Tech Officer at Accor  says: In a world where authentic connection is key  Accor embraces technology  particularly AI  as a powerful force for genuine hospitality. We leverage this intelligence to remove friction and create essential space  enabling guests to immerse in meaningful real-life moments  and empowering our teams to foster deeper  human-led interactions. This strategic blend of digital and hospitality ensures every touchpoint truly enhances the journey  making travel more intuitive  enriching  and personal than ever before.“POINTS MAXXING”Vibe: PrestigeRewards as passports to the extraordinary.For decades  loyalty programmes were synonymous with free flights  room upgrades and the occasional complimentary breakfast. Today  it goes beyond simple rewards to become a key to rare moments  usually inaccessible places  and experiences that offer as much prestige as lasting memories. 72% of travelers place access to unique or unforgettable experiences at the heart of what they value most in loyalty programs  and one in three members uses their points to live something exceptional - experiences that deliver a true sense of belonging and prestige.At ALL Accor  this vision comes to life through 'Limitless Experiences'  where points open doors to locations and events that are usually out of reach. In Paris  La Suite Novotel by ALL.com (in partnership with Paris-Saint-Germain soccer team)  located above the Parc des Princes pitch  transforms a PSG match into a fully immersive experience: sleep at the heart of the stadium  feel the intensity of the game from your bed  enjoy butler service and backstage access… a “money can't buy” experience reserved for members only  accessible only through points auctions or contests  now one of the most coveted experiences in the sports world.For younger fans  the PSG 'Escort Kids' experience takes immersion to the next level: children walk onto the field hand-in-hand with their favorite players. This approach goes far beyond football  giving members privileged access behind the scenes of music  lifestyle  and sports: backstage passes at concerts  meetings with artists  exclusive experiences at Roland-Garros  and for a lucky few  the thrill of stepping onto the legendary Philippe-Chatrier court to play alongside champions. Meanwhile  in Rio  points open the doors to the most prestigious lounges at the Sambadrome  offering a unique immersion in the heart of Carnival.At ALL Accor  we believe travel is more than moving between places. The true value comes from feeling moved – having your emotions stirred and passions roused... Because the future of travel is not about what you see  but how deeply you feel.
