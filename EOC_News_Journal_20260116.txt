54667,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/630982-eu-ukraine-loan-russian-assets/,Brussels reveals new plan to steal Russian assets,The European Commission has formally presented a €90 billion ($105 billion) EU taxpayer-funded loan package for Kiev Read Full Article at RT.com,The EU intends to tap the frozen reserves if Kiev fails to repay a new €90 billion loanThe European Commission has formally presented a €90 billion ($105 billion) EU taxpayer-funded loan package for Kiev  insisting that its original idea to eventually use frozen Russian assets for the purpose remains on the table.Kiev’s Western backers froze $300 billion in Russian central bank assets after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The majority is held at the Belgian-based depository Euroclear.Last month  the EU failed to agree on using the funds as collateral for a ‘reparations loan’ for Ukraine. As a compromise  the bloc decided to fund Kiev through common debt  leaving taxpayers to cover interest payments of at least €3 billion a year for as long as the loan remains outstanding.On Wednesday  the European Commission formally presented the Ukraine Support Loan  adding that the original plan to appropriate Russian funds “remains on the table.”“The Union reserves its right to use the Russian assets immobilized in the Union to repay the loan  in full accordance with EU and international law ” it stated.Russia  as well as several EU members  has long insisted that no existing law can justify the move. Brussels has approved legislation to keep the assets blocked indefinitely but has so far found no legal basis to seize them outright. Instead  it has resorted to siphoning off proceeds through a 99.7% tax on ‘windfall profits’ generated by the frozen assets to arm Kiev.Brussels said two-thirds of the new €90 billion loan is intended for weapons for Kiev  with the remainder covering its budget deficit over the next two years.EU nations are now reportedly clashing over how to ensure that the money goes to European weapons manufacturers rather than American manufacturers.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov this week accused the EU of being “obsessed with finding money to continue the war.”Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic secured exemptions from the borrowing scheme  arguing that Kiev will never be able to repay the loan. Brussels expects repayment only when Ukraine receives ‘reparations’ from Russia – a scenario Moscow has called detached from reality.Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that the EU will eventually have to return Russia’s sovereign assets  warning that not doing so would cause severe reputational damage and undermine the foundations of the modern financial system.Moscow has also filed a lawsuit against Euroclear for damages linked to its “inability to manage” the funds and said it would expand the case to include European banks holding the assets  citing the EU’s continued attempts to seize them.,neutral,0.0,0.93,0.07,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['new plan', 'Russian assets', 'Brussels', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank assets', 'EU taxpayer-funded loan package', 'next two years', 'severe reputational damage', 'modern financial system', 'Belgian-based depository Euroclear', 'several EU members', 'new €90 billion loan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The European Commission', 'Ukraine Support Loan', 'European weapons manufacturers', 'frozen reserves', 'American manufacturers', 'European banks', 'Russian funds', 'original idea', 'Western backers', 'common debt', 'interest payments', 'original plan', 'full accordance', 'international law', 'existing law', 'legal basis', 'windfall profits', 'budget deficit', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Czech Republic', 'borrowing scheme', 'sovereign assets', 'The Union', 'EU nations', 'Ukraine conflict', 'reparations loan', 'Kiev', 'purpose', 'table', 'escalation', 'majority', 'collateral', 'compromise', 'bloc', 'taxpayers', 'Wednesday', 'right', 'move', 'Brussels', 'legislation', 'proceeds', '99.7% tax', 'two-thirds', 'remainder', 'money', 'war', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'exemptions', 'repayment', 'scenario', 'Moscow', 'reality', 'foundations', 'lawsuit', 'damages', 'inability', 'case', 'attempts']",2026-01-15,2026-01-16,rt.com

The National Medical Products Administration in China has approved two Sanofi-licensed innovative medicines  Myqorzo (aficamten) for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM)  and Redemplo (plozasiran) for the reduction of triglyceride levels  in adult patients with familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) on the basis of dietary control.“We are pleased to bring Myqorzo and Redemplo to patients in Greater China. Both medicines represent important advances in treatment options and address unmet medical needs among people living with complex conditions ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines  Sanofi. “The latest approvals underscore Sanofi’s long-term commitment to bringing innovative medicines to Chinese patients.”Myqorzo is a selective  small-molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor to improve functional capacity and relieve symptoms in patients with oHCM  in which the myocardium  the heart muscle  becomes abnormally thick. It is the most common monogenic inherited cardiovascular disorder. The approval was based on the positive pivotal SEQUOIA-HCM phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05186818) in patients with symptomatic oHCM.Redemplo is a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) medicine  suppressing the production of apoc-III  an important target for reducing triglycerides in patients with FCS. FCS is a severe and rare disease where extremely high triglyceride levels can lead to various serious signs and symptoms including acute and potentially fatal pancreatitis  chronic abdominal pain  diabetes  hepatic steatosis  and cognitive issues. The approval was based on the positive pivotal PALISADE phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05089084) in patients with genetically confirmed or clinically diagnosed FCS.About HCMHCM is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder  characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (myocardium). This leads to the left ventricle becoming smaller and stiffer  impairing its ability to relax and fill with blood  limiting the heart’s pumping function and exercise capacity. HCM symptoms include: chest pain  dizziness  shortness of breath  or fainting during physical activity.HCM has two forms: oHCM (two-thirds of patients)  where thickened muscle blocks blood flow  and non-obstructive HCM (one-third)  where the muscle is thickened but blood flows normally.HCM patients face serious complications including atrial fibrillation  stroke  and mitral valve disease. It's a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes due to dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities. Some patients have a high risk of progressive diseases leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure requiring transplantation.About MyqorzoMyqorzo (aficamten) is a selective  small-molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor discovered following an extensive chemical optimization program that was conducted with careful attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties. Myqorzo was designed to reduce the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently suppress the myocardial hypercontractility that is associated with HCM. In preclinical models  Myqorzo reduced myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site  thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state. Myqorzo is approved in the US and China.Myqorzo  for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM  was designated breakthrough therapy and orphan drug in the US  and breakthrough therapy in China. On December 12  2025  The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization in the EU with a final decision expected in the first quarter of 2026. In December 2024  Sanofi obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Myqorzo in Greater China for treating both forms of HCM. These rights came through an agreement with Corxel Pharmaceuticals  who had acquired them from Cytokinetics.About FCSFCS is a severe and rare disease leading to extremely high triglyceride levels  over 880 mg/dL (9.94 mmol/L). Such severe elevations can lead to various serious signs and symptoms including acute and potentially fatal pancreatitis  chronic abdominal pain  diabetes  hepatic steatosis  and cognitive issues.About RedemploRedemplo (plozasiran) is a siRNA medicine suppressing the production of apoC-III  a protein produced primarily in the liver that raises triglyceride levels by slowing their breakdown and clearance. By targeting apoC-III with sustained silencing  Redemplo delivers significant reductions in triglyceride levels. Redemplo has been studied in both genetically confirmed and clinically diagnosed patients living with FCS. Redemplo  for the treatment of FCS  was designated breakthrough therapy  fast track  and orphan drug in the US  orphan in the EU  and breakthrough therapy in China. Redemplo is approved in the US  Canada  and China for the treatment of FCS patients. Regulatory review is ongoing in the EU.In August 2025  Sanofi acquired the rights to develop and commercialize Redemplo in Greater China from Visirna Therapeutics  a majority-owned subsidiary of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
