Is a drop below $92 000 on the cards?,Key takeaways:The BTC futures premium held near 5%  showing leverage demand was not impacted after a failed $98 000 breakout attempt.Bitcoin ETFs saw $395 million in outflows as gold hit new records  weakening hedge appeal and pushing traders to price downside risk.Bitcoin (BTC) faced a 3.4% correction over the weekend as investors cut risk following rising global sociopolitical tensions and China reporting its slowest economic growth since 2022.The retest of the $92 000 level caught bulls off guard  as $215 million in leveraged BTC futures longs (buys) were forcefully liquidated  fueling concerns that a deeper price correction could be underway.Nasdaq index futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingViewNasdaq index futures traded lower on Monday after US President Donald Trump announced additional import tariff proposals targeting eight European countries  aimed at pressuring negotiations over Greenland’s acquisition  a territory controlled by Denmark. European nations are now discussing retaliatory measures on US product imports  according to Yahoo Finance.Weak BTC derivatives flag fading interest and hedge appealInvestors sought safety in cash positions and precious metals as US markets remained closed on Monday due to a national holiday. The Euronext 100 Index declined 1.6%  while gold prices surged above $4 650 for the first time. As a result  even though Bitcoin quickly reclaimed the $93 000 level  the broader market continues to view cryptocurrencies as risk-on assets rather than alternative hedges.Bitcoin futures basis rate. Source: laevitas.chThe Bitcoin futures’ annualized premium (basis rate) hovered near the neutral-to-bearish 5% level  indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions was not affected by the failed attempt to reclaim $98 000 on Wednesday. Still  the lack of enthusiasm in BTC derivatives markets may signal waning interest from institutional investors.Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $395 million in net outflows on Friday  further weighing on traders’ sentiment. As gold and silver prices push to all-time highs  Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge appears less compelling. In response  professional traders have demanded higher premiums to provide downside protection.BTC 30-day options delta skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.chThe BTC options delta skew at Deribit jumped to 8%  indicating that put (sell) options are trading at a premium. In neutral market conditions  this indicator typically ranges from -6% to +6%. As a result  the recent Bitcoin price downturn has reduced whales’ confidence in a bullish breakout above $100 000. Macroeconomic factors continue to dominate headlines and  in turn  shape traders’ risk appetite.George Saravelos  head of FX research at Deutsche Bank  noted that “European countries own $8 trillion of US bonds and equities  almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined ” while the US fiscal imbalance depends on sustained capital inflows. Consequently  Europe may no longer “be as willing” to support the US dollar if the “Western alliance” becomes existentially disrupted.China’s economy grew 4.5% year-on-year in the last quarter of 2025  down from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Strong exports helped offset weaker consumer spending and business investment  according to the Associated Press. Analysts warn that consumer stimulus policies introduced in 2025 could be scaled back  while a global trade war may weigh on exports.Related: US Bitcoin traders flip bearish–Is BTC price at risk of losing $90K?Bitcoin network daily active addresses.

The Company had been awaiting further information with respect to its formal response to the vaccine license suspension. Valneva was recently informed of the FDA’s further decision to now place the Investigational New Drug (IND) on clinical hold pending an investigation of a newly reported foreign Serious Adverse Event (SAE).There are currently no clinical studies involving IXCHIQ® that are actively vaccinating participants  and the Company intends to move forward with its planned post-marketing clinical activities  subject to further discussions with relevant regulatory authorities.The SAE occurred outside of the U.S. and involved a younger adult who received three concomitant vaccines  including IXCHIQ®. Based on the information made available to Valneva  which the Company submitted to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as well as to all other pharmacovigilance systems in accordance with the products license  the case may be plausibly related to IXCHIQ® vaccination  but causality has not been determined. The Company is actively seeking additional information to further characterize the case.Valneva is committed to upholding the highest safety standards  and the Company continues to engage proactively with health authorities in all territories where IXCHIQ® is licensed  including Europe  Canada  the United Kingdom and Brazil. While IXCHIQ® is currently focused on travelers to regions where the virus is endemic  such as tropical and subtropical areas in Asia  Africa  and the Americas  and persons for whom vaccination is medically justified based on risk in accordance with the approved label and vaccination guidance  the Company continues to believe that IXCHIQ®’s benefit-risk profile also remains favorable for people living in the endemic and outbreak settings  where IXCHIQ® may be uniquely positioned as a highly durable single-shot vaccine.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years1.In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas2. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.4About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Subject to ratification by the next General Meeting and to her renewal for a four-year term  it is specified that Ms. Laurence BATLLE will be appointed as a member and Chair of the Audit  Risk and Sustainability Committee  replacing Mr. Eric DONNET  who is expected to become Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board with effect from March 27  2026.As a result of these changes  ARGAN’s Supervisory Board comprises 6 members  including 2 independent members  thus representing one third of its composition  in accordance with the recommendation of the Middlenext code.ARGAN adds that this appointment leads to gender parity within its Supervisory Board.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 22: Annual results 2025March 26: General Assembly 2026April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 23: Half-year results 2026October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20262027 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 4: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2026quarter 2026 January 21: Annual results 2026March 25: General Assembly 2027About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

This is the fifth time in the Group’s history that it has been recognised in this prestigious list  confirming the “Leadership” level it first reached in 2019.CDP operates the world’s only global independent environmental disclosure platform. Its assessment is based on a rigorous methodology  aligned in particular with the recommendations of the TCFD1. It measures the quality and completeness of disclosed data  governance  the identification and management of climate-related risks and opportunities  as well as the implementation of best practices  especially the setting of ambitious targets and measurable emissions reduction actions. This recognition confirms the robustness of JCDecaux’s climate commitments and the strength of its ESG strategy.Reducing the Group’s carbon footprint remains an absolute priority for JCDecaux  which is committed to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050  with a key milestone in 2030. To this end  the Group has embarked on a science-based emissions reduction pathway  validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in June 2024  with medium- and long-term absolute reduction targets at Group level:By 2030: reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 73% and Scope 3 emissions by 46% in absolute terms compared with 2019 (market-based). In 2024  JCDecaux made significant progress towards these targets  reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based) by 65% and its Scope 3 emissions by 21% versus 2019 .. By 2050: reduce Scope 1  2 and 3 emissions by at least 90% in absolute terms compared with 2019 (market-based).These targets are underpinned by concrete levers across all the countries where the Group operates  including:Applying circular economy principles  notably through the eco-design and refurbishment of its street furniture;Reducing the electricity consumption of its street furniture and sites;Transitioning to a low-emission vehicle fleet  providing eco-driving training and optimising logistics routes.In this same transition dynamic  stakeholders are also engaging on their own decarbonisation pathways with the aim of achieving Net Zero Carbon by 20502. JCDecaux also welcomes the acceleration of green public procurement  which is a powerful lever for driving the transition to a circular economy. To meet these expectations  the Group is stepping up its engagement alongside cities  transport authorities  airports  shopping centres  media agencies and advertisers to co-develop responsible media solutions and lower-resource  lower-carbon street furniture  supporting more sustainable territories and urban environments.By providing services of real value to cities  citizens and travellers  JCDecaux’s business model  with almost 50% of the Group’s revenue aligned with the European Union Taxonomy  underscores the virtuous and sustainable nature of its activities.Sherry Madera  CEO of CDP  said: “Congratulations to all companies on CDP’s A List. Businesses earning an ‘A’ score are proving that environmental ambition and commercial strength go hand in hand. High quality data gives leaders the confidence to make earth-positive decisions that secure long-term competitiveness  attract capital and safeguard natural systems. These organisations show what is possible when transparency becomes the foundation for action.”Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: “We are very proud that JCDecaux has been included in CDP’s A List for the fifth time since 2019  and for the third year running. This new international recognition confirms the robustness of our climate commitments  the strength of our 2030 ESG Strategy and the effectiveness of the concrete actions implemented by all our teams worldwide to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. As we target Net Zero Carbon by 2050  with a key milestone in 2030  we remain fully committed to aligning our pathway with international best practice  particularly that validated by the SBTi  as well as with the requirements of the European Union Taxonomy and the new transparency framework introduced by the CSRD3. This recognition encourages us to further strengthen our commitments and to continue our collective actions  bringing all our stakeholders – employees  local authorities  advertisers  partners and investors – on board to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable economy.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2024 revenue: €3 935.3m – H1 2025 revenue: €1 868.3mN°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 091 811 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 894 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants12 026 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the SBF 120 and CAC Mid 60 indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (11.9)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (629 737 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 157 airports and 257 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 848 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (83 472 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (736 310 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (178 010 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (89 526 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (22 490 advertising panels)N°2 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (20 689 advertising panels)For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on X   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Clémentine Prat+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – clementine.prat@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.com1 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures2 United Nations – Climate Action Champions – 20243 Corporate Sustainability Reporting DirectiveAttachment,positive,0.55,0.45,0.0,positive,0.8,0.2,0.0,True,English,"['sustainable media company', 'A List', 'third year', 'JCDecaux', 'CDP', 'position', 'global independent environmental disclosure platform', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'lower-resource, lower-carbon street furniture', 'Science Based Targets initiative', 'measurable emissions reduction actions', 'science-based emissions reduction pathway', 'long-term absolute reduction targets', 'Carbon Disclosure Project', 'low-emission vehicle fleet', 'green public procurement', 'European Union Taxonomy', 'Jean-François Decaux', 'Net Zero Carbon', 'responsible media solutions', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'international best practice', 'sustainable media company', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'new transparency framework', 'circular economy principles', 'third consecutive year', 'same transition dynamic', 'new international recognition', 'annual A List', 'High quality data', 'environmental transparency', 'environmental ambition', 'long-term competitiveness', 'carbon footprint', 'third year', 'media agencies', 'concrete actions', 'collective actions', 'sustainable economy', 'best practices', 'absolute priority', 'absolute terms', 'ambitious targets', 'sustainable territories', 'sustainable nature', 'prestigious list', 'A’ score', 'climate change', 'non-profit organisation', 'fifth time', 'rigorous methodology', 'climate-related risks', 'ESG strategy', 'key milestone', 'significant progress', 'concrete levers', 'electricity consumption', 'eco-driving training', 'logistics routes', 'decarbonisation pathways', 'powerful lever', 'transport authorities', 'shopping centres', 'urban environments', 'real value', 'business model', 'Sherry Madera', 'earth-positive decisions', 'natural systems', 'Executive Board', 'local authorities', 'Key Figures', 'climate commitments', 'Euronext Paris', 'Leadership” level', 'commercial strength', 'H1 2025 revenue', 'Scope 3 emissions', 'Group level', 'JCDecaux SE', '2 emissions', '2024 revenue', 'Scope 1', 'CDP', 'position', '19th', 'number', 'performance', 'fight', 'place', '20,000 companies', 'history', 'world', 'assessment', 'recommendations', 'TCFD', 'completeness', 'governance', 'identification', 'management', 'opportunities', 'implementation', 'setting', 'robustness', 'SBTi', 'June', 'countries', 'eco-design', 'refurbishment', 'sites', 'stakeholders', 'aim', 'acceleration', 'expectations', 'engagement', 'cities', 'airports', 'advertisers', 'services', 'citizens', 'travellers', 'virtuous', 'activities', 'CEO', 'Congratulations', 'Businesses', 'hand', 'confidence', 'capital', 'organisations', 'foundation', 'Chairman', 'effectiveness', 'teams', 'requirements', 'CSRD3.', 'employees', 'partners', 'investors', '2019']",2026-01-19,2026-01-20,globenewswire.com
