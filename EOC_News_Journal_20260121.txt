54713,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/20/londons-stock-market-is-looking-up-unlike-dublins/,London’s stock market is looking up  unlike Dublin’s,London bankers are optimistic about the year ahead for IPOs,There has been a cloud over the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in recent years  with a number of companies – CRH among them – shifting their main listing to the US while others decided to go public on an American market instead of the UK capital.That led to a huge amount of hangwringing in The City  with various doomsayers warning of the decline of London as a financial hub.Last year the LSE faced a dearth of listings  to the point that the regulator changed rules to allow overseas companies to have secondary listings there  a tacit acceptance that the exchange now plays second fiddle to the US behemoths of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.All this will probably sound familiar to any followers of the Irish capital markets scene. Euronext Dublin  as the Irish Stock Exchange is known these days  has been haemorrhaging listings in recent years. The exchange has been pleading with the Government to amend tax rules on holding shares in an effort to boost transactions on the Dublin market.In the budget  then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe reduced tax on gains made by Irish investors in investment funds and scrapped stamp duty on share trading in public companies worth up to €1 billion. Still  only one small company has moved to go public here since then.In the UK  it would seem to be a different story. There is optimism among bankers of a slew of listings to come this year  and British chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed a “new golden age” for The City this weekend  according to the Financial Times.Trump vs the Fed: What does it mean for global trade and Ireland? Listen | 23:47Requirements for bond and share listings have been eased  while the British government created a stamp duty holiday for three years on sales of stock in newly listed businesses.Those measures have helped to revive the market  with financial firm Shawbrook among those to have floated last year. Now  numerous firms are tipped to list in London this year and things are looking up. That’s in contrast to Dublin  where the mood music is still pessimistic despite Donohoe’s changes.The uncomfortable truth is that London has been a global financial centre for centuries. Dublin  if it is a global centre  has only held that position for decades.
