54717,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/631280-gold-offset-frozen-assets/,Russian gold gains offset frozen asset value – Bloomberg,Soaring gold prices have generated over $216 billion in windfall gains for Russia’s central bank since early 2022  Bloomberg has said  Read Full Article at RT.com,Soaring prices add over $216 billion to bullion holdings since 2022  the outlet has calculatedRussia has benefited from a surge in gold prices since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict  earning windfall gains comparable to the value of the country’s sovereign reserves frozen in the West  Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.The Bank of Russia’s gold holdings have gained over $216 billion since February 2022  calculations show.Western countries froze about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets as part of Ukraine-related sanctions. The majority of the funds are held at Belgium-based depository Euroclear. The EU has been debating using the funds as collateral for a so-called ‘reparations loan’ for Kiev  and in December extended the freeze with a long-term measure that would keep the assets blocked indefinitely.The rise in the value of Russia’s gold holdings restores much of the country’s lost financial capacity  even if blocked reserves remain inaccessible  the outlet said. Unlike securities and cash frozen in Europe  the metal can still be sold or used as collateral if needed.The value of Russia’s gold reserves more than doubled from February 2022 through end-2025  while holdings of foreign currencies and assets fell by about 14%  central bank data show. Gold now comprises 43% of total reserves  up from 21% prior to the Ukraine conflict.Total international reserves stood at $754.8 billion as of January 1  data showed  with monetary gold accounting for $326.5 billion. The bank’s gold holdings were valued at $141 billion on February 1  2022.Gold prices have surged over the past four years  jumping by 60% in 2025 alone  driven by robust demand from central banks  persistent inflation concerns  and heightened geopolitical tensions.Precious metal futures surged to a record high on Tuesday  surpassing $4 720 per ounce and marking a 2.71% gain  exchange data showed. Analysts linked the rally to increased geopolitical risks  including US President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff threats against European countries opposed to his Greenland takeover plan.The Russian Finance Ministry expects gold prices to continue to climb towards $5 000 per ounce and beyond.Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Moiseev said in December that the current rally stems from eroding confidence in global reserve currencies  adding that attempts to expropriate Russian assets are further bolstering demand.,neutral,0.0,0.68,0.31,negative,0.0,0.37,0.62,True,English,"['Russian gold gains', 'frozen asset value', 'Bloomberg', 'Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Moiseev', 'US President Donald Trump', 'The Russian Finance Ministry', 'Russian central bank assets', 'past four years', 'persistent inflation concerns', 'Greenland takeover plan', 'global reserve currencies', 'monetary gold accounting', 'Precious metal futures', 'central bank data', 'Total international reserves', 'Russian assets', 'The Bank', 'central banks', 'The EU', 'foreign currencies', 'total reserves', 'Soaring prices', 'gold prices', 'Ukraine conflict', 'windfall gains', 'sovereign reserves', 'Western countries', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'Belgium-based depository', 'reparations loan', 'long-term measure', 'financial capacity', 'gold reserves', 'geopolitical tensions', 'exchange data', 'geopolitical risks', 'tariff threats', 'European countries', 'bullion holdings', 'gold holdings', 'robust demand', 'current rally', 'outlet', 'surge', 'escalation', 'value', 'country', 'Bloomberg', 'Tuesday', 'February', 'calculations', 'part', 'majority', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'collateral', 'Kiev', 'December', 'freeze', 'rise', 'securities', 'cash', 'end', 'January', 'record', 'ounce', '2.71% gain', 'Analysts', 'confidence', 'attempts']",2026-01-21,2026-01-22,rt.com

At the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  Wednesday (Jan. 21)  panelists signaled that real-world financial use cases are beginning to take hold  particularly in payments and settlement.…,Trust  regulation and yield will decide what scales next.Stablecoins are emerging as the first scaled use case  but banks and central banks are insisting on guardrails.A panel at the World Economic Forum said tokenization is gaining momentum as costs fall and cross-border frictions shrink.Tokenization is emerging beyond the confines of pilot programs.By completing this form  you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor  if applicable  in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .Complete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content — no additional logins required.At the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  Wednesday (Jan. 21)  panelists signaled that real-world financial use cases are beginning to take hold  particularly in payments and settlement.While artificial intelligence has dominated headlines  the discussion  “Is Tokenization the Future? ” made clear that tokenization work has continued steadily in the background  setting the stage for broader embrace.Euroclear CEO Valérie Urbain framed tokenization not as a rupture with existing market structures  but as a natural evolution that expands access while lowering costs.She said tokenization can “reach out to a bigger range of investors” while also helping issuers by “reducing the time to market” and “reducing the cost of issuing.”Urbain pointed to early institutional experiments  including the tokenization of commercial paper in France  as evidence that entire market ecosystems  including issuers  investors and infrastructure  must move together for tokenization to scale. She described the initiative as large enough to be meaningful but contained enough to allow the market to learn before expanding further.Advertisement: Scroll to ContinueTokenization as a Problem SolverCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said tokenization addresses structural inefficiencies in the financial system  particularly around settlement speed  fees and access.Tokenization enables real-time settlement and lower fees  he said  but he emphasized that its most powerful impact is expanding participation in investment markets.Armstrong highlighted what he described as a global “unbrokered” population—roughly 4 billion adults who lack access to invest in high-quality assets—and positioned stablecoins as the first successful expression of tokenization’s potential.From his perspective  stablecoins demonstrate how tokenized representations of assets can unlock broader participation across borders  he said.Scale  Stablecoins and Cross-Border PaymentsRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reinforced the idea that stablecoins are tokenization’s first scaled use case. He cited rapid growth in stablecoin transaction volumes and pointed to cross-border payments as an area where tokenized money is already showing measurable impact.Ripple’s focus is on bridging traditional finance and blockchain networks  Garlinghouse said  adding that tokenization’s value lies in connecting existing systems rather than replacing them outright. In cross-border payments  that bridge reduces friction  settlement delays and costs that have long burdened international commerce.Regulation as an Enabler  Not an ObstacleFrench central bank governor François Villeroy de Galhau pushed back on the idea that regulation and innovation are inherently opposed. Tokenization and stablecoins “will bring progress in global finance delivery ” he said  including lower transaction costs and improved payments.However  he warned that unregulated private money could threaten monetary sovereignty.“Regulation is not the enemy of innovation … it’s a guarantee of trust ” he said.Central banks must provide a public anchor  potentially through wholesale central bank digital currencies  while allowing regulated private tokenized money to operate alongside it  he said.The US Legislative BackdropThe panel also highlighted legislative momentum in the United States. Armstrong described ongoing negotiations around crypto market structure and stablecoin legislation  saying regulation should not be used to limit competition or favor incumbents. Consumers benefit most when regulated banks and crypto firms compete on equal footing.Reflecting on Ripple’s past regulatory battles  Garlinghouse said clarity matters more than perfection  adding that clear rules are preferable to prolonged uncertainty.Momentum Builds  but Not Without ConditionsMomentum emerged as a recurring theme. Garlinghouse said the pace of adoption has accelerated as U.S. policy has shifted toward a more constructive stance on cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Still  he cautioned that tokenization must deliver tangible benefits  warning against tokenizing assets “just to tokenize something.”That pragmatism resonated across the panel  particularly as participants discussed which tokenized transactions are gaining traction first  spanning payments  settlement  collateral management and cross-border transfers.Yield  Store of Value and Competing ModelsYield emerged as a dividing line between different forms of tokenized money. Armstrong said that allowing rewards on stablecoins could benefit consumers and improve competitiveness  particularly as other jurisdictions explore interest-bearing digital currencies.Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters took a more segmented view.“Tokens are going to be used for two things ” he said. “They’ll be used as a medium of exchange ” with “no particular need to bear interest for a medium of exchange because they’ll be instantly transmitted. And they’ll be used as a store of value.”Real Assets  Bitcoin and SkepticismReal-world assets will eventually settle in digital form  even if the path varies by jurisdiction and regulation  Winters said.There was debate during the panel discussion over the emergence of a ‘bitcoin standard.”Armstrong framed Bitcoin as an inflation-resistant alternative to fiat systems  stating that “we are also seeing the birth of a new monetary system that I would call the ‘bitcoin standard’ instead of the gold standard.”Villeroy de Galhau expressed skepticism  saying money is a core element of democratic sovereignty and public accountability.“I always keep repeating that money … for centuries has been a public-private partnership and you need a public anchor ” he said.In another observation  Villeroy de Galhau summed up what might be termed the panel’s cautious optimism  saying tokenization and stablecoins “might be the name of the game this year.”For all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage  subscribe to the daily Digital Transformation Newsletter.,neutral,0.17,0.83,0.0,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['Davos Power Brokers', 'Tokenization', 'François Villeroy de Galhau', 'wholesale central bank digital currencies', 'Euroclear CEO Valérie Urbain', 'French central bank governor', 'The US Legislative Backdrop', 'real-world financial use cases', 'Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong', 'first scaled use case', 'regulated private tokenized money', 'Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse', 'first successful expression', 'unregulated private money', 'World Economic Forum', 'early institutional experiments', 'global “unbrokered” population', 'past regulatory battles', 'entire market ecosystems', 'stablecoin transaction volumes', 'global finance delivery', 'U.S. policy', 'existing market structures', 'crypto market structure', 'unlimited free access', 'lower transaction costs', 'central banks', 'financial system', 'regulated banks', 'tokenized representations', 'Privacy Policy', 'traditional finance', 'existing systems', 'stablecoin legislation', 'crypto firms', 'legislative momentum', 'cross-border frictions', 'pilot programs', 'marketing communications', 'additional logins', 'artificial intelligence', 'broader embrace', 'natural evolution', 'bigger range', 'commercial paper', 'Problem Solver', 'structural inefficiencies', 'lower fees', 'powerful impact', 'investment markets', '4 billion adults', 'rapid growth', 'measurable impact', 'blockchain networks', 'international commerce', 'monetary sovereignty', 'public anchor', 'United States', 'ongoing negotiations', 'equal footing', 'clear rules', 'recurring theme', 'constructive stance', 'tangible benefits', 'collateral management', 'cross-border transfers', 'PYMNTS content', 'broader participation', 'Cross-Border Payments', 'settlement speed', 'real-time settlement', 'high-quality assets', 'blockchain innovation', 'tokenization work', 'Trust', 'regulation', 'yield', 'Stablecoins', 'guardrails', 'panel', 'confines', 'form', 'sharing', 'sponsor', 'accordance', 'Terms', 'Conditions', 'article', 'Davos', 'Switzerland', 'Jan.', 'hold', 'headlines', 'discussion', 'Future', 'background', 'stage', 'rupture', 'investors', 'issuers', 'France', 'evidence', 'infrastructure', 'initiative', 'Advertisement', 'potential', 'perspective', 'borders', 'idea', 'area', 'focus', 'value', 'bridge', 'delays', 'Enabler', 'Obstacle', 'progress', 'enemy', 'guarantee', 'competition', 'incumbents', 'Consumers', 'clarity', 'perfection', 'uncertainty', 'pace', 'adoption', 'cryptocurrency', 'something', 'pragmatism', 'participants', 'transactions', 'traction']",2026-01-21,2026-01-22,pymnts.com

Designed for enhanced receptor affinity and internalization  IPN10200 delivered a longer and clinically significant duration of effect. The molecule has been optimized for safety and efficacy and is being evaluated across four Phase II trials in both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.About LANTICLANTIC (n=727) a Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of IPN10200 in three aesthetic indications of moderate to severe upper facial lines: glabellar lines  forehead lines and lateral canthal lines  across 3 Stages. Stage 1 includes patients evaluating safety and efficacy of IPN10200 in a dose finding and dose escalation stage in glabellar lines  with three defined steps including multiple doses of IPN10200; dose-escalation (step 1: Phase Ib)  dose finding vs placebo and vs Dysport (step 2: Phase II) and additional dose finding vs placebo and vs Dysport (step 3: Phase II).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Here's what we know.,"Elon Musk has said he could buy Ryanair amid an ongoing public spat with the budget airline's boss Michael O'Leary.The two have clashed numerous times over the past few days  resulting in Mr Musk asking his X followers if he should buy Ryanair and ""restore Ryan as their rightful ruler"".Ryanair responded by announcing a ""big idiot seat sale""  which it says is for the billionaire tech mogul and any other ""idiots"" on Mr Musk's social media platform.Here is everything you need to know about why the two outspoken chief executives are trading insults  from what has been said to why it began in the first place.What is the row about?The spat appears to have stemmed from Mr O'Leary ruling out equipping Ryanair jets with Mr Musk's Starlink satellite internet service  after rivals Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS announced a deal to install Starlink on its aircraft.In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on 16 January  Mr O'Leary said he would not install the technology because he believed that passengers on Ryanair's short-haul flights would ""not be willing to pay"" to use it.Image: Elon Musk and Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary. Pics: Reuters and APHe added it would cost the company about €200-250m per-year to use the tech and add 1-2% to their fuel bill due to the two aerials required on each flight  which would impact the aerodynamics of the aircraft.He told the radio station he would ""pay no attention whatsoever"" to Mr Musk  labelling him an ""idiot"".""Musk knows even less about airline ownership rules than he does about aircraft aerodynamics "" he said.Read more:How Musk is boosting the British rightMusk's race for spaceWhat has happened since?The Ryanair X account - which is known for its posts which mock criticisms of the airline and weighs in on current events - has since goaded Mr Musk over the issue of wifi.Unsurprisingly  Mr Musk has not ignored the temptation to reply.He has labelled Mr O'Leary an ""utter idiot""  a ""chimp""  called for him to be sacked and said he ""has no idea how aeroplanes even fly"".Musk feud is a free swing for Ireland's most savvy PR operator Stephen Murphy Ireland correspondent @SMurphyTV For an utter idiot  Michael O'Leary is a happy man. The Ryanair boss lounged cheerfully around the Mayson Hotel in Dublin today  not exactly looking like a CEO at war with the world's richest man. It’s clear - in time-honoured Ryanair fashion - he's welcoming the free publicity generated from his week-long feud with Elon Musk  who regards him as an ""utter idiot"" and an ""insufferable chimp"" among other epithets. ""I think I probably agree with that""  O'Leary told me  laughing. ""I have four teenage children who regularly call me an utter idiot and an insufferable chimp."" This is a free swing for the Ryanair boss  who has launched a seat sale off the back of the row - garnering millions of views online already. There's no real threat - it would seem - of Musk forcing a buyout of his airline. EU regulations are in place to prevent airline ownership by citizens of countries outside the EU and a few others. The share price has remained stable - investors aren't panicking. As for the insults - water off a duck's back for O'Leary. Even so  he pulled some punches at his press conference today - there were no fresh barbs for Musk. Rather  an air of bemusement was the order of the day - as Ireland's most savvy PR operator reaps the rewards of a feud being closely watched by millions.At a news conference on 21 January  in which he said he would address Mr Musk's ""Twitter tantrum""  Mr O'Leary quipped that he is not insulted by the remarks.Speaking to Sky News' Ireland correspondent Stephen Murphy he quipped: ""I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp.""Is the 'big idiot sale' real?Using the argument to promote its start-of-the-year sale  Ryanair launched the ""great idiots seat sale"" which essentially involves 100 000 one-way tickets being sold for £16.99 for flights from January to April.Both Ryanair's website and X page have been changed to feature the promotion  which involves what appears to be an AI-generated image of Mr O'Leary and Mr Musk.Image: Michael O'Leary promoting Ryanair's latest sale. Pic: ReutersCould Musk actually buy Ryanair?While the social media posts from the world's richest man have widely been taken as provocative rather than serious  Mr Musk's takeover of X  formerly Twitter  began with a surprise offer to buy it after he built up a stake.After asking his 232 million X followers whether he should buy Ryanair and replace Mr O'Leary with someone called Ryan  an overwhelming majority (76.5%) said Mr Musk should do so.X X   which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Commissioning of Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A has continued to advance during the past month  following the challenges reported in Q4  and we continue to target nameplate capacity operations at WCP A on a consistent basis in Q1 2026. Capital expenditure will be significantly reduced in the year ahead  with approximately $30 million expected to be incurred at WCP A and lower sustaining capex than in 2025.In light of current industry outlook  our primary operating focus for 2026 will be on value over volume  representing a shift from the historical focus on maximising production. Under this approach  we will be producing sufficient volumes to achieve product shipments of at least 1.1 million tonnes  an increase of over 15% year-on-year  which will unlock the value of the working capital contained in our current product inventories. Annual production guidance for 2026 is therefore lower than in recent years and we will also seek to limit operating costs  where possible.Demand for Kenmare’s products remained stable in 2025 and we have a strong order book for Q1 2026. However  continued uncertainty regarding market conditions in the medium term has led us to further reduce our pricing assumptions. Consequently  we expect to recognise an impairment charge on our assets in 2025 that is not anticipated to exceed $300 million for the year  inclusive of the impairment loss recorded at half-year. This will be a non-cash charge with no anticipated impact on our operations  projects or financing facilities or the Company’s ability to pay dividends.”OverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.07 per 200 000 hours worked to 31 December 2025 (31 December 2024: 0.06)  with two Lost Time Injuries (“LTIs”) in Q4 2025Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 1 233 300 tonnes in 2025  down 15% year-on-year (“YoY”)  due primarily to lower excavated ore volumes relating to the upgrade work to Kenmare’s largest mining plant  WCP AIlmenite production of 842 300 tonnes in 2025  down 17% YoY  due to lower volumes of HMC processedShipments of finished products of 947 900 tonnes in 2025  down 13% YoY – two shipments were partially loaded at year-end  meaning they will be reflected in H1 2026 shipping volumesNet debt of $158.8 million at 31 December 2025 (2024: $25.0 million)  with the increase due primarily to peak capital expenditure spent on the WCP A upgrade project during the year of approximately $156 millionThe Company expects to recognise an impairment charge on its assets in 2025 that is not anticipated to exceed $300 million  inclusive of the impairment charge declared in H1 2025Significantly reduced capital expenditure expected to be incurred in 2026  with approximately $30 million planned to be incurred on the WCP A upgrade project and $30 million of sustaining capital– discretionary capital items are being deferred during this period of higher net debt and weaker product marketsDemand for Kenmare’s products was stable in 2025  although prices declined throughout the year due to market oversupply – Kenmare has a strong order book for Q1 2026 but this is likely to reflect weaker market pricing than experienced in 2025Total shipments are expected to be in excess of 1.1 million tonnes in 2026 – Kenmare intends to undertake a significant draw down of its finished product stockpiles by adjusting productionIn line with this approach  Kenmare expects ilmenite production in 2026 to be in excess of 800 000 tonnesLower total cash operating costs are expected in 2026  compared to 2025  in the range of $215 million to $225 million (at the minimum production guidance level) due to lower production volumes  the reduced use of dry mining and the implementation of other cost saving opportunitiesOngoing engagement with the Government of Mozambique regarding the extension of Moma’s Implementation Agreement (“IA”)  including a second Presidential meeting in November 2025Operations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q4 and full year 2025 were as follows:Q4 2025 vs Q4 2024 vs Q3 2025 2025 vs 2024 Tonnes/%THM1 % change % change Tonnes/%THM % change Excavated ore2 9 215 000 -11% 3% 36 958 000 -10% Grade2 3.36% -32% -17% 4.04% -3% Production HMC produced 264 300 -39% -11% 1 233 300 -15% HMC processed 267 700 -39% -5% 1 215 300 -16% Ilmenite 183 400 -40% -12% 842 300 -17% Primary zircon 10 600 -28% -14% 50 000 -1% Rutile 1 900 -34% 6% 8 600 -12% Concentrates3 62 400 457% 193% 103 100 124% Shipments 231 600 -25% 2% 947 900 -13%Total Heavy Mineral Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and a new concentrates by-product  ZrTiKenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 31 December 2025 was 0.07 per 200 000 hours worked (31 December 2024: 0.06). While two relatively minor LTIs were incurred in Q4 2025  Kenmare achieved its lowest ever All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.75 (2024: 0.93) to 31 December  supported by its Trabalho Seguro (Safe Work) initiative.HMC production in Q4 2025 was 264 300 tonnes  down 39% YoY. This was due to a 32% decrease in ore grades following the elimination of dry mining at WCP A  which previously targeted high-grade areas  as a cost management initiative  and a lower than expected contribution from dry mining at WCP B. Excavated ore volumes were also down 11%  largely due to the slower than anticipated production ramp up of WCP A following the upgrade work.HMC production in 2025 was 1 233 300 tonnes  down 15% YoY  due primarily to lower excavated ore volumes relating to the WCP A upgrade work. Ore grades were down 3% YoY  with higher grades mined at WCP B in Pilivili partially offset by WCP A approaching the end of its mine path in Namalope. Encouragingly  the Selective Mining Operation (SMO) met its expected production rate of 50 000 tonnes in 2025  benefitting from a strong Q4 performance.Production of finished products was significantly lower in Q4 2025 than in Q4 2024  largely due to lower HMC processed as a result of reduced HMC availability. Ilmenite production was 183 400 tonnes  down 40% YoY  broadly in line with the reduction in HMC processed. Primary zircon production was 10 600 tonnes  down 28% YoY  and rutile production was 1 900 tonnes  down 34% YoY  also largely due to the reduced HMC processed  but offset by significantly improved recoveries and drawdown of some intermediate stocks for processing. Concentrates production in Q4 2025 was 62 400 tonnes  up 457% YoY  due to the reprocessing of historical stockpiles delivering Kenmare’s new concentrates product  ZrTi. Kenmare expects to be able to continue to reprocess these stockpiles for the next two years  significantly supplementing ongoing ZrTi production during this time. Following successful trial shipments of ZrTi in 2025  Kenmare now sees it as a valuable by-product. Consequently  ZrTi will be included in the Company’s routine production disclosure  instead of only being recognised as production when it is shipped  as was the case during its market trial period.Kenmare achieved revised 2025 production guidance for ilmenite and rutile and original production guidance for primary zircon. The Company materially exceeded original production guidance for concentrates.Total production of finished products was 1 004 000 tonnes  down 10% YoY (2024: 1 115 300 tonnes)  impacted by a 16% decrease in HMC processed. Ilmenite production was 842 300 tonnes in 2025  down 17% YoY  broadly in line with the reduction in HMC processed. Primary zircon production was 50 000 tonnes  down only 1% YoY  with the lower HMC processed largely offset by the decision to reprocess intermediate stockpiles and attain higher recoveries. Rutile production was 8 600 tonnes  down 12% YoY  with the lower HMC processed also partially offset by reprocessing of intermediate stockpiles. Concentrates production was 103 100 tonnes (including 59 960 tonnes of ZrTi in 2025)  up 124% YoY  benefitting from the incorporation of ZrTi in production metrics.Shipments in Q4 2025 were 231 600 tonnes  down 25% YoY  due primarily to slower loading rates on initial ZrTi shipments. Shipment volumes in Q4 2025 comprised 158 600 tonnes of ilmenite  28 500 tonnes of primary zircon  6 900 tonnes of rutile and 37 600 tonnes of concentrates.Total shipments in 2025 were 947 900 tonnes  down 13% YoY  due primarily to poor weather conditions in H1 and the Peg transshipment vessel going into its five-yearly dry dock for maintenance work between June and September. Although shipment volumes in H1 were slightly stronger than in H2  the product mix was higher value in the second half of the year  as expected  with 35 500 tonnes of primary zircon shipped in H2 (H1: 14 700 tonnes) and 10 600 tonnes of rutile (H1: Nil). Kenmare also shipped 23 900 tonnes of ZrTi in 2025  which is included in concentrates production  and has identified significant ongoing demand for this product. Shipments during the year comprised 820 600 tonnes of ilmenite  50 200 tonnes of primary zircon  10 600 tonnes of rutile  and 66 600 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of 2025 was 29 200 tonnes  compared with 14 100 tonnes at the start of the year. Closing stock of finished products at the end of 2025 was 344 000 tonnes  compared with 287 200 tonnes at the end of 2024. This includes approximately 30 000 tonnes of ilmenite partially loaded at year-end. Kenmare had higher than usual levels of finished product stock at year-end and shipments are expected to materially exceed production in 2026  driving a significant reduction in finished product inventories.Post period-end  several southern provinces of Mozambique have been impacted by severe flooding. Kenmare’s operations are located in northern Mozambique and have not been materially affected to date  with electricity provision from the grid network remaining stable. The Moma area has experienced heavy rains  which are not unusual at this time of year  and some local roads have been impacted. Kenmare has adjusted its regular supply and logistics arrangements where necessary to address this. Similarly  there has been minimal impact on local communities to date  with no damage to homes or other infrastructure.Capital projects updateKenmare has completed all major construction and installation work associated with the upgrade of its largest mining plant  WCP A  ahead of its transition to the Nataka ore zone. The Company is now in the final stages of the commissioning and ramp up process. WCP A’s transition to Nataka is essential to securing Kenmare’s production for decades to come. WCP A will mine in Nataka for the remainder of its economic life  which is expected to exceed 20 years.The capital cost estimate for the WCP A upgrade  transition to Nataka and associated infrastructure remains unchanged at $341 million  with unallocated contingency remaining within that figure. Project capital spend in 2025 was approximately $156 million  with an additional $12 million incurred that will be paid in 2026. At year-end  approximately $280 million of the project capital for the WCP A upgrade had been incurred  representing approximately 82% of the estimated total spend  in line with expectations. Capital expenditure on the WCP A project is scheduled to reduce significantly from 2026 onwards  with approximately $30m expected to be spent in 2026 (including the $12 million mentioned above). The remaining approximately $40 million of project capital largely relates to infrastructure within the Nataka area and is planned to be invested between 2027 and 2032.While overall progress on the commissioning of WCP A in Q4 2025 was positive  some elements of the commissioning process have taken longer than anticipated  which impacted 2025 production. The ramp up of WCP A is continuing and remedial measures implemented in Q4 are working well. As the commissioning process has progressed  additional bottlenecks have been identified and the Company is undertaking a range of low-cost rectification measures in Q1 to achieve a sustainable nameplate capacity of 3 500 tonnes per hour. The extended ramp up of WCP A is not expected to impact 2026 ilmenite sales due to Kenmare’s relatively high product inventories.Market updateDemand for all of Kenmare’s products remained stable in Q4 2025  although pricing continued to decline. This is due to the global titanium feedstocks and zircon markets remaining over-supplied  despite some reduction in supply during the year.Globally  demand for titanium feedstocks softened in 2025  as weak housing markets and low consumer confidence led to a reduction in pigment production in Europe and China  with sales of paint and coatings remaining subdued.Chinese pigment production in 2025 remained broadly in line with 2024. Elevated sulphuric acid prices in China supported the shift towards chloride pigment production  which reached record output levels in Q4. This supports demand for ilmenite suitable for beneficiation  which includes all of Kenmare’s ilmenite products. Some western pigment producers reduced production capacity during 2025  with closure and idling of several pigment plants.Increasing production of domestically-mined ilmenite in China  together with higher production of ilmenite from concentrates from outside China  continued to negatively impact feedstock prices. In response to this surplus supply  some mining companies have suspended or reduced production.The zircon market remained subdued in Q4 2025  although demand for all of Kenmare’s zircon products continued to exceed the Company’s ability to supply and Kenmare finished the year with near-zero inventories. Global zircon prices declined during Q4  due to increased supply and acceptance from customers of lower-quality zircon contained in concentrates. Encouragingly  however  prices in China appeared to have stabilised towards the end of Q4 due to reduced supply.Kenmare has a strong order book for Q1 2026 and the Company continues to see robust demand for its products  despite continued market softness. However  elevated feedstock inventories held by both western and Chinese pigment producers are expected continue to impact demand and pricing in 2026. These factors have led Kenmare and external commentators to take a more conservative view on the likely timing and scale of pricing recovery and market growth in the medium term  however adjustments to long-term assumptions are more modest.Finance and corporate updateFinancial positionKenmare had cash and cash equivalents of $48.6 million at year-end (2024: $56.7 million). Gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $206.4 million (2024: $80.4 million) and lease liabilities were $1.0 million (2024: $1.3 million). As a result  the Company had net debt of $158.8 million at year-end (2024: $25.0 million).The increase in net debt is due primarily to peak capital expenditure on the WCP A upgrade project during the year of approximately $156 million of cash spent  and the Company also made dividend payments of $24.1 million. Net debt is expected to remain elevated through 2026.Unfortunately  invoices totalling $9.3 million for shipments made to a customer in Q3 remain unpaid and Kenmare is pursuing all avenues for recovery  primarily on the basis of its retention of title. The shipments in question were delivered to two separate customer operations  which are subject to individual restructuring and sales processes. Kenmare understands that these sales processes are ongoing  with one at an advanced stage.Kenmare is meeting its funding obligations through operating cash flows  available current assets and its $200 million Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”). In late 2025  following a request by the Company  Kenmare’s lenders granted a reset of the net debt to EBITDA covenant under its RCF  including adjusting the full year 2025 covenant to a level of 3.0x. These adjustments are intended to maintain ongoing covenant compliance through this period of elevated net debt.Impairment charge and inventory valuation in 2025 Preliminary ResultsLower revenue assumptions associated with the continued uncertain pricing outlook outlined above are expected to result in a lower estimated recoverable value attributable to Kenmare’s mining and processing assets as at 31 December 2025. Accordingly  as this value is less than the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  an impairment will be recognised in Kenmare’s 2025 Preliminary Results. This impairment  which also reflects the latest amendments to the IA proposed by the Company (but not yet ratified by the Government)  and includes amounts recognised at the half year ($100.3 million)  is not expected to exceed $300 million at the consolidated Group level. This is non-cash charge and does not impact Kenmare’s continuing operations  development programmes  ability to pay creditors or dividends  or debt covenant compliance.Should circumstances permit  there is scope for this impairment to be reversed in future periods. Further details will be provided in the 2025 Preliminary Results.The expected realisable market value of Kenmare’s ilmenite stocks is also impacted by the weaker pricing outlook  and in certain cases is now estimated to be below its cost of production. Accordingly  the carrying value of the stocks will be reduced to its net realisable value in the 2025 Preliminary Results  leading to an adjustment of approximately $15 million.Implementation AgreementThe IA governs the terms under which Kenmare conducts its mineral processing and export activities. Although the IA’s original expiry date was 21 December 2024  the Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided confirmation that Kenmare’s existing rights and benefits remain in full force and effect pending conclusion of the extension process. Mining operations at Moma are conducted under a separate regulatory framework  which is not impacted in any way by the IA process.Moma’s IA continues to be a key focus and Kenmare’s Managing Director  Tom Hickey  met with the President of Mozambique twice in 2025  first in June and then in late November. On both occasions the President emphasised Moma’s importance to Mozambique and stressed the Government’s intention to renew the IA  however the ongoing delay and uncertainty remains a significant concern.Kenmare continues to engage with the Government  while reserving the right to safeguard its contractual entitlements  up to and including arbitration  if an agreement cannot be reached.Appointment of Katia Ray to Board of DirectorsKenmare appointed Ekaterina (Katia) Ray as an independent Non-Executive Director in October 2025  as previously announced. Katia has over 25 years of senior-level experience in the mining sector  including with FTSE 100 companies in Europe  Africa  North America and Asia. Her experience covers a range of commodities  such as industrial minerals  diamonds and platinum group metals.2026 guidance2026 guidance for production and operating costs is as follows:Unit 2026 Guidance 2025 Actual Shipments tonnes In excess of 1 100 000 947 900 Production Ilmenite tonnes In excess of 800 000 842 300 Primary zircon tonnes In excess of 41 000 50 000 Rutile tonnes In excess of 7 500 8 600 Concentrates1 tonnes In excess of 81 000 106 200 Costs Total cash operating costs $m 215-2252 N/R3 Cash costs per tonne of finished product $/t 240-2502 N/R3Concentrates include secondary zircon  mineral sands concentrate and ZrTi Based on minimum 2026 production guidance To be reported in full year financial statementsKenmare’s focus in 2026 will be to deliver shipment volumes in excess of 1 100 000 tonnes  which represents more than a 15% uplift compared to 2025. Shipments are planned to include a significant draw down of finished product inventories.The Company intends to produce lower volumes of finished products in 2026 than it has in recent years to minimise operating costs and accelerate the drawdown of finished product stocks. Consequently  ilmenite production is expected to be a minimum of 800 000 tonnes  with corresponding reductions in the production of primary zircon and rutile. Production will be flexed upwards from this minimum guidance level to meet market demand once inventory levels have normalised. The reprocessing of tailings to produce ZrTi is expected to supplement concentrates production and as such  concentrates production is expected to be in excess of 81 000 tonnes in 2026.Constraining production in 2026 will allow the Company to target a reduction in operating costs compared to 2025  in line with its value over volume approach. Kenmare’s guidance for total cash operating costs in 2025 was $228 million to $252 million; operating costs for 2025 will be within this range and full details will be provided in the 2025 Preliminary Results. Kenmare has also conducted a thorough assessment of its cost structure and identified some opportunities to further decrease operating costs in 2026  including minimising the use of dry mining. A retrenchment process in respect of approximately 15% of its workforce was also initiated in Q4 2025; while regretted  this is a necessary and proportionate response to the challenges currently being experienced by Kenmare and the wider industry. Total cash operating costs in 2026 are therefore expected to be from $215 million to $225 million  with cash costs per tonne of finished product of $240 to $250  at the minimum production guidance.Expenditure on the WCP A upgrade project is expected to be $30 million in 2026; this includes approximately $12 million that was incurred in 2025 and that will be paid in 2026. The WCP A project remains on budget  with a total cost estimate of $341 million. Sustaining capital costs in 2026 are expected to be approximately $30 million  which is lower than in 2025. Kenmare is committed to maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and ensuring it is well-positioned for a recovery in its product markets  therefore will seek to defer discretionary capital cost items wherever practicable and safe to do so.Private investor webinar via Investor Meet CompanyKenmare will host a webinar for private investors via Investor Meet Company at 2:00pm UK time today (21 January 2026).Questions can be submitted via the Investor Meet Company dashboard at any time during the live presentation.Investors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and register for the Kenmare webinar at:https://www.investormeetcompany.com/kenmare-resources-plc/register-investorInvestors who already follow Kenmare on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.Notice of 2025 Preliminary ResultsKenmare plans to release its 2025 Preliminary Results on 25 March 2026.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcKatharine Sutton / David WeeksInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of titanium minerals.

Nikos is struggling  Haris…gets algorithmized  and Pavlos is waiting,Behind the scenes of the Greece–Egypt ferry connection & Dynacom Tankers’ bet on VLCCsThe post K.M’s concern  President Maria was stunned (and pulled herself together?)  Nikos is struggling  Haris…gets algorithmized  and Pavlos is waiting appeared first on P…,Newsroom January 21 10:22Hello  I will start today with a report I saw yesterday in El País about the tragic railway accident in Andalusia. The reputable newspaper  as well as footage from television stations  shows two enormous cranes attempting to lift a railcar in order to “reveal” what lies beneath it. In general  reading about what has been happening in Spain since the day before yesterday in relation to a dramatic event similar to the one we experienced in 2023  you unfortunately find frightening differences in how this issue is being handled — by the opposition  by the media  and even by society itself. At least until the investigation progresses and the judicial inquiry begins. In other words  the word “cover-up” — despite the fact that authorities are using cranes  machinery  etc. in an effort to exhaust even the slightest possibility of finding a survivor — has not been heard anywhere.Mitsotakis’ concern and Davos– Genuinely concerned about geopolitical developments  K.M. appeared yesterday at the Presidency  briefing Tasoulas shortly before departing for Davos later today. The prime minister appears particularly troubled in conversations with his interlocutors by the tension between the U.S. and Europe over the issue of Greenland  and also reluctant for Greece to participate in Trump’s much-discussed “peace meeting ” as are the other European leaders. Mitsotakis departs at midday for the Swiss resort  and today’s schedule will likely include a closed-door dinner  while his main panel is around 11:30. Of course  he will hold as many bilateral meetings as possible  as he must leave early in the afternoon for Brussels  where EU leaders will gather for a dinner with Trump  Greenland  and their response on the menu.President Maria was stunned…– I return now briefly to the favorite topic of the past few days. Those who have some contact with President Maria tell me that she was thunderstruck and deeply upset by the outcome of her interview the day before yesterday. As usual  Karystianou did not examine what she said wrong or what mistake she made  but instead lashed out at the media and… something happened. The most common thing  after all  is that when something goes wrong  journalists or the media are always to blame. In any case  I’m told that for now the president will cut back on her “free appearances ” meaning she will not give live interviews to journalists who do not intend to play the role of Agapi. For older readers among you  if you remember  Agapi was a likable lady who asked softball questions alongside the late Vangelis Giannopoulos on “Channel 29” of the also late Giorgos Kouris. In any case  to be honest  the president may have accused journalists yesterday  but in substance she did not retract her opinion on abortions. “They haven’t even thought about what a couple or a woman who is forced to have an abortion goes through ” she said. Of course  she probably does not take into account that most unwanted pregnancies happen due to momentary mistakes (where are you  Paschalis…)  but that is another matter.Agricultural Chamber– I go back to yesterday’s Mitsotakis–Tasoulas meeting  which covered many issues  including the farmers’ mobilizations. I’m told that K.M. expressed cautious optimism to the President regarding the farmers’ withdrawal from the roadblocks and said that the state has exhausted all its capabilities to support farmers  but has not exhausted its ongoing desire to remain in dialogue with them. Tasoulas  on the other hand  told K.M. that the lesson of the past two months with the roadblocks and all the mobilizations is that it is extremely important to have a collective  representative umbrella body that represents the agricultural sector and engages in dialogue with the government of the day — a kind of Agricultural Chamber  which K.M. himself has already discussed in broad terms.Hatzidakis–Skertsos– Beyond their very good cooperation in coordinating government work  Vice President Hatzidakis and Minister of State Skertsos yesterday undertook to present the key initiatives for 2026 at the level of government action. The government plan includes 10 major legislative initiatives and 30 key reforms and projects  and obviously the government needs to step on the gas  because this year is the last one in which it can produce measurable work. What I found interesting in the presentation was a series of indicators that demonstrate  according to the government duo  how convergence with Europe is being achieved — for example in unemployment indicators  public spending on health and defense  closing the VAT gap  and even in the relationship between electricity imports and exports.ND pre-conferences– Most likely at the end of the month  or at the latest in early February  ND’s pre-conferences will begin across Greece. I remind you that they were supposed to start last Saturday in Thessaloniki  but party officials decided not to press the button while the issue with the farmers remained unresolved  since everyone would have focused on that. Depending on Mitsotakis’ availability  5–6 thematic pre-conferences will be held in Ioannina  Patras  Larissa  Thessaloniki  Heraklion  and possibly Rhodes  while the ND congress begins on May 15.Androulakis– Now  before I move on to yesterday’s “Nikos… it’s probably not raining” PASOK report  I’ll make a small observation. The statement by spokesperson Marinakis on the government’s position on Greenland is clear: he said yesterday  “International law is not up for discussion and is not questioned; Greece stands with Denmark and with Europe; America can find some solutions — more bases  radars  etc.” Why he needed that statement  especially yesterday amid the chaos unfolding in Androulakis’ party  no one quite understood — but it’s not the first time.President Nikos  Haris  and the magic algorithm– So it was quite an atmosphere yesterday at the meeting of PASOK’s Political Secretariat under our president Nikos. All hell broke loose  and this time it was Doukas who kicked things off  and how could he not  given that for days he had been throwing barbs at the president. Haris bluntly told him that “our strategy has failed” (well  surprise…) and something along the lines of “we’ll only see the goal of first place through binoculars if we don’t change course” — though I imagine he meant unless you go home. President Nikos  of course  was not caught off guard; he expected it and deflected angrily  responding  “What are you talking about?”The fight over the algorithm– Where it seems our president really lost it was when he heard Doukas talking about a “magic algorithm” that Androulakis’ people are allegedly preparing for participation in the Congress. According to the mayor and other PASOK figures  Androulakis is preparing an algorithm under which Athens would be represented by significantly fewer delegates than a prefecture in Crete! Will Crete stage a landing at the Congress? Doukas demanded the withdrawal of the “magic algorithm ” but Nikos is said to have replied  “That’s how it is  take it or leave it!” The clash between Doukas and Androulakis yesterday was endless. When the mayor again proposed holding primaries to select parliamentary candidates  the president cut him off almost mid-sentence. “What are you saying? We held primaries many years ago and that system failed ” Androulakis is said to have argued — only to hear Doukas reply with a slight smile: “If it failed  then why did you put it in the statutes and we voted on it at the previous Congress?”And Geroulanos…– As if Doukas wasn’t enough  pushing him even on post-election alliances  he also had Geroulanos giving him a dressing-down  under the pretext of the unmoving needle. Pavlos  of course  also kept his eye on the needle of his watch  because time was passing and he had to cut the ceremonial cake at the Caravel  whose walls — from the many PASOK meetings held there over the years — hear the news first  especially when it isn’t good. Geroulanos reportedly called to “declare the party in a state of alarm.” Nonsense  really — he just wanted to land one last blow. The question is whether yesterday marked the beginning of a more systematic attack on Nikos A. that will lead somewhere  or just another pointless intra-party barrage.Coincidences at Piraeus Port: Paying dearly for “Calypso”– For the 7th consecutive month  a significant and noteworthy decline has been recorded in container traffic at the country’s largest port  Piraeus. For the full year just ended  the decline exceeded -6%  to 3.967 million TEU. This may not show up on the bottom line of the balance sheet  as PPA increased its service tariffs. The real problem  however  lies in “Calypso ” the largest customs fraud ever uncovered in the EU. In June 2025  the European Public Prosecutor seized 2 435 containers in Piraeus — a record seizure in EU history. The ring  led by Chinese nationals with Greek customs brokers as accomplices  along with two customs officers  had for years been importing electric bicycles and scooters from China disguised as spare parts or other undervalued goods. The evaded customs duties and VAT were estimated at €700 million across Europe  with 17 shell companies from Bulgaria using Greek tax IDs. The fraud was uncovered  but immediately afterward a bottleneck was created at the Port of Piraeus. Thousands of containers remain at the port awaiting thorough inspection  effectively blocking capacity. The infamous “Kelly ” the Chinese mastermind of the fraud in whose possession €4 million in cash was found  had set up a mechanism that flooded Europe with fraudulent goods via Piraeus. She caused a traffic jam at the Port of Piraeus  resulting in the company’s share price plunging by more than 15% over the past six months. The market understands the impact better than the reassuring official announcements.Chaos — again — at the HCMC (EXAE) general meeting– Yesterday’s extraordinary general meeting of HCMC (EXAE) was also eventful  convened once again to change the company’s board of directors in the context of its acquisition by Euronext. The previous meeting  on December 22  2025  was deemed “null and void” following objections raised by shareholder and lawyer Konstantinos Drougas  who challenged the legality of the convocation dates. As a result  it was postponed again  and yesterday afternoon a new thriller unfolded  as the same shareholder announced that  in addition to filing a lawsuit regarding the holding of the general meeting  he has also submitted injunctions and two applications to annul the acquisition to the Council of State. As he argued  the decision to prematurely terminate the board’s term is unlawful  as it is not provided for by law  and since a lawsuit has been filed  the convening of an extraordinary general meeting is also unlawful. Furthermore  among the multiple legal arguments he invoked  he claimed that the voting procedure via postal ballots is also unlawful  and therefore so is the acquisition of HCMC by Euronext. In short: total chaos. G. Chatzinikolaou  acting as interim chair of the general meeting  did not adopt these arguments; there were some heated exchanges between the two  and in the end he stated that “we fundamentally disagree” and that the process would continue normally — which it did. The vote was completed  the items were approved  and it remains to be seen whether there will be any future legal complications for Euronext Athens — something rather unlikely  although with lawyers you never know. Still  if this “match” continues with surprises and new annulments  I can see Bouznas soon paying to get rid of HCMC.Xenokostas  after shipyards and ships  now sets course for trains– A new company was established yesterday  Tuesday January 20  by Panos Xenokostas of ONEX. It is named “ONEX Rolling Stock & Integrated Systems S.A.” (“ONEX RSIS”)  headquartered in Elefsina  with the primary purpose of providing repair and maintenance services for railway cars (locomotives) and railway rolling stock. Beyond that  various activities are provided  such as engineering consulting services  mechanical engineering studies  engineering services for energy projects  design and development of information technologies  reconstruction and equipment services for railway and tram machinery and rolling stock  among others. In other words  after shipyards and ships  ONEX is now setting course for trains as well. The initial share capital is €25 000  paid in by Panos Xenokostas with €2 500 corresponding to 250 shares (a 10% stake in the company)  and by ONEX S.A. for Innovative Products and Services – IT – Aeronautical Applications – Security Systems  represented by him  with €22 500 corresponding to 2 250 shares (a 90% stake). The first Board of Directors includes Panos Xenokostas as Chairman & CEO  as well as Ioannis Stamatopoulos and Konstantinos Keratsas as members.No solution for industrial electricity– At SEV (the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises)  frustration is boiling over regarding the solution for industrial electricity  as no light appears at the end of the tunnel. Last week  at a meeting with journalists at the Ministry of Energy  the deputy minister — tasked by the prime minister with finding a solution to the cost of industrial electricity — Nikos Tsafos  informed reporters that there is no solution. Even though SEV put a ready-made solution on the table  based on the so-called Italian model  he told journalists that he cannot implement it because the Commission would not allow him to grant a subsidy. He failed to mention  however  that it is not a subsidy but a loan  which industry would repay with interest. That is precisely why it does not need to be notified to the Commission. His second justification was that the Italian model was approved first and the CISAF came afterward  and therefore it cannot proceed. However  public documents prove exactly the opposite — that the CISAF came first and the Italian model afterward. At SEV  there is serious concern  as it appears that the deputy minister is torpedoing every solution by invoking various justifications  while they cannot understand how at the same time Bulgaria  Germany  France  and Italy manage to do everything possible to support their production.At noon  the machines fell silent at the Viohalco Group– The Stasinopoulos family’s initial decision was to keep the circle of people accompanying the “patriarch of Viohalco ” Nikos Stasinopoulos  to his final resting place very small. After all  the late businessman was known for his consistent distance from publicity (there is even a myth that he paid photographers not to photograph him at public appearances). Ultimately  however  hundreds of prominent figures from the economic  political  artistic  and academic spheres expressed their wish to attend Nikos Stasinopoulos’ funeral  and late the previous afternoon the original decision was changed. Yesterday at noon  all Viohalco Group factories  in every country where the group operates  stopped operations for one hour. Employees paid tribute to the man  the entrepreneur  the visionary of Greek industry. Many notable individuals gathered at the First Cemetery of Athens. No eulogy was delivered  by decision of the family  which respected Nikos Stasinopoulos’ genuine modesty. The words of the Metropolitan of Thebes  Livadeia and Aulis  Georgios  were enough to describe the path and role of the great businessman.The Chinese ambassador has begun public relations– You read last Monday in this column about the fact that the Chinese embassy in Greece organized  for the first time  an event to cut the New Year’s cake. I return to that event because the most striking moment was when Ambassador Fang Qiu took the microphone and sang Dionysis Savvopoulos — specifically an excerpt from the song “Let the dances continue ” emphasizing the lyric “history is made by groups of friends.” Beyond his singing efforts  on January 28 a closed meeting will be held at the Embassy  with the participation of representatives of Greek media and members of the diplomatic mission. The meeting  described as informal  falls within the framework of exchanging views and strengthening communication with journalists. The central figure of the discussion will be the Ambassador  who is expected to speak on issues of common interest  while the presence of younger diplomats from the embassy is also of interest  as they will share experiences and observations from their work in Greece. According to information  the discussion will have an open character  with the possibility for participants to ask questions  although it has been requested in advance that topics for discussion be submitted  in order to allow better preparation.Behind the scenes of the Greece–Egypt ferry connection– In the informal discussions at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy  the Patras–Egypt ferry connection is now being discussed in a way that shows the issue has moved beyond diplomatic pleasantries. The meeting with the Egyptian delegation and Pan Marine was anything but coincidental  according to those close to it. The question is no longer “if ” but “when” — and above all under what terms — the route will be established so that it is viable. Behind closed doors  particular importance is being attached to the involvement of the Port Authority of Patras  as the upcoming signing of a cooperation agreement with Pan Marine is considered the first tangible step. It is clear that Athens views this ferry connection as part of the broader strategy of tightening ties with the Sisi government. Pan Marine Group is a large  independent Egyptian company in shipping  transport  and logistics  with more than 45 years of market presence. It employs over 950 people  with operations in more than 20 locations across Egypt such as Alexandria  Damietta  Port Said  Suez  etc.  and manages services at all major ports in the country. Attempts at a ferry connection in the past  focused on Alexandria  remained on paper. We shall see.Dynacom Tankers’ bet on VLCCs– Giorgos Prokopiou recently concluded an agreement for four new VLCCs at the Chinese shipyards Hengli Heavy Industries  which was announced by the parent company Songfa Ceramics on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The deal indicates that the shipowner is reshaping capital allocation and investment strategy. Equity analysts reading these deals see Dynacom Tankers converting part of shipbuilding risk into a long-term asset  committing significant production capacity at Chinese shipyards that have now moved into the front line of the world’s top VLCC builders. VLCCs with a capacity of 306 000 dwt remain highly valuable for global crude oil transport  with steady demand and high revenue margins during periods of strong shipping activity. From an investment perspective  VLCC orders shape the balance sheet and future cash flows  while strengthening Dynacom’s competitiveness.Now that’s… a gift– Extra virgin olive oil with 24-carat edible gold leaves will be offered as a protocol gift by the Minister of Environment and Energy  Stavros Papastavrou  to Saudi officials visiting the Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy tomorrow. Specifically  according to the relevant documents  the commitment of a total credit amounting to €136.40 was approved for the payment of an equivalent expense charged to the Regular Budget of the Ministry of Environment and Energy (“Offices of the Minister  Alternate Ministers  Deputy Ministers  General Secretaries  Alternate General Secretaries and the Administrative Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Energy”) from the account for “Promotion  advertising and public relations expenses ” fiscal year 2026  “for the procurement of protocol gifts  EPTAECHOS AGOURÉLAIO EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL WITH 24K EDIBLE GOLD LEAVES 500ml  which will be given by the Minister of Environment and Energy on 22.1.2026 during meetings with the Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Mr. Bandar bin Ibrahim Alkhorayef and Mr. Khalid AlMudaifer  Deputy Minister for Mining Affairs of Saudi Arabia.” As promoted  “EPTAECHOS agourelaio (Heptachord  in Greek) comes from the rare local Nemoutiana variety  whose olive trees dominate the mountainous areas around the sacred site of Ancient Olympia  and whose fruit is harvested by hand. It is ideal for raw consumption  has a uniquely rich taste  an intense fruity aroma  and a distinctive aftertaste reminiscent of freshly cut olive and wild nature.” Apparently  oil men in Saudi Arabia don’t just wear gold — they eat it too.A… luminous company– Having accumulated numerous distinctions for her work on high-aesthetic lighting projects for public and private spaces (residences  museums  monuments  hotels  restaurants  shopping centers  squares  façades of public buildings  etc.)  Eleftheria Deko decided to take another entrepreneurial step  this time focusing on the real estate market. Thus  a few days ago she proceeded with the establishment of the company “Living Design Single-Member P.C. ” headquartered in Argyroupoli — where Eleftheria Deko Lighting Design has long been based — with the purpose of buying  selling  and managing real estate  holiday accommodations  construction of residential buildings  and more. The initial share capital is €200 000  divided into 2 000 corporate units with a nominal value of €100 each  fully paid in by her  as she also assumes management and representation of the new company. It is worth recalling that Eleftheria Deko studied philology and ballet in Greece  then received a scholarship to New York University  where she completed her postgraduate program in performing arts  and subsequently taught stage lighting at the same university for two years. She returned to Greece in 1992 and began a remarkable career  with many significant milestones  such as the lighting of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2004 Olympic Games  the recent lighting of the Acropolis and the archaeological site at Sounion  as well as more than 600 theater  opera  and music productions. In 2005  she also became an assistant professor of stage lighting at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki  in the Theatre Department of the School of Fine Arts.The Danes  after products and services  now boycott U.S. bonds as well– Akademiker Pension is a Danish pension fund with assets of $25 billion  managing the savings of teachers and academics. It held a $100 million position in U.S. Treasuries. It officially announced that by the end of the month it will fully liquidate this position. CIO Anders Schelde put it bluntly: “The U.S. is not a good credit risk  and in the long term public finances are not sustainable.” Trump’s threats over Greenland  ballooning fiscal deficits combined with rhetoric about lower interest rates and a weaker dollar  form a picture of credit risk that  for the first time  a major European institutional investor is articulating publicly. Denmark  a close NATO ally that sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan  feels betrayed. On the same day  in the streets of Copenhagen  10 000 Danes wore red caps with the slogan “Make America Go Away.” The Facebook group “Boykot Varer Fra USA” surpassed 95 000 members  coordinating boycotts of Tesla  Netflix  Coca-Cola  even Gmail. The Salling Group supermarket chain marked European labels with asterisks in 1 700 stores. The boycott of American values is expanding. In Canada  a 70% drop in bookings for flights to the U.S. is being recorded. Similar groups are emerging in Sweden  France  and Germany. The phenomenon is unique. The U.S. bond market is facing an unprecedented situation: the refusal of a Western ally to finance the American superpower not for economic reasons  but for reasons of values.All eyes on Powell before the Supreme Court today– The American central banker announced that he will personally attend the Supreme Court hearing in the Lisa Cook case  a move that clearly reveals the depth of the crisis in relations between the White House and the Federal Reserve. The case concerns the U.S. President’s attempt to dismiss Lisa Cook from the Fed in August 2025  citing allegations of mortgage fraud  which she categorically denies. It is the first time in the 111-year history of the Fed that a member of its Board of Governors has been dismissed. Lower-court rulings have vindicated Cook  but the Supreme Court’s decision will determine the limits of presidential power vis-à-vis independent institutions. If the President prevails  he would gain a majority on the seven-member Fed board. We all heard Steven Miran’s views last week at the National Gallery. The White House’s economic adviser was sworn in as a Fed “governor ” formalizing political influence over the Central Bank. At present  the U.S. central banker faces dual pressure: on one hand  the President’s public demands for aggressive rate cuts  pushing the dollar rate down to 1%  and on the other  criminal subpoenas from the Department of Justice regarding renovations of Fed buildings. Today’s trial in the Cook case goes beyond the individuals involved. It concerns the 1913 law that entrusted governmental authority to an Independent Central Bank.
