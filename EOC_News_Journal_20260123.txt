54734,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/631346-belgian-pm-de-wever-russian-eu-assets-act-war/,Stealing Russian assets would be ‘act of war’ – Belgian PM,Stealing frozen Russian funds  the bulk of which are held in Belgium  would be an “act of war ” the Belgian PM Bart De Wever has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Bart De Wever has explained why his country opposed an EU ‘reparations loan’ for UkraineStealing Russian assets frozen in the EU would amount to a “declaration of war” against Moscow  Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has said.Western nations froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian central bank assets following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The bulk of the funds – approximately $216 billion – is held in Belgium-based depository Euroclear. Belgian officials opposed an EU scheme which would have leveraged the money as collateral for a €90 billion ($105 billion) ‘reparations loan’ for Kiev. The European Commission failed last month to secure the backing of bloc leaders for the plan  opting instead to raise common debt.Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland on Thursday  De Wever said that “you cannot simply confiscate money – that is an act of war. You should not underestimate it.”“We are not at war with Russia  Europe is not at war with Russia ” he stressed  noting that “immobilized money  even during WWII  was never confiscated.” De Wever argued that appropriating frozen Russian assets would be unprecedented and would undermine trust in the financial system and the eurozone.Last month  De Wever described the European Commission’s push to “steal” frozen Russian sovereign assets as “very unwise and ill-considered ” warning that it posed “great risks” to Belgium  according to VRT.Speaking at a live Q&A session in December  Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the appropriation of Moscow’s assets by the EU would risk undermining “foundations of the modern financial world order.”“Whatever they steal and however they do it  they will have to pay it back someday ” Putin stated at the time.Late last year  Moscow initiated arbitration proceedings against Euroclear.Nevertheless  the European Commission has not given up on its original scheme to tap into the frozen Russian funds. Last week  it said that the controversial proposal “remains on the table.”,negative,0.0,0.42,0.58,negative,0.0,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Belgian PM', 'Stealing', 'act', 'war', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'live Q&A session', 'modern financial world order', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'World Economic Forum', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian funds', 'The European Commission', 'EU ‘reparations loan', 'Belgian officials', 'financial system', 'Western nations', 'Belgium-based depository', 'bloc leaders', 'common debt', 'great risks', 'arbitration proceedings', 'original scheme', 'controversial proposal', 'EU scheme', 'Ukraine conflict', 'immobilized money', 'country', 'declaration', 'war', 'Moscow', 'escalation', 'February', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'collateral', 'Kiev', 'backing', 'plan', 'sidelines', 'Davos', 'Switzerland', 'Thursday', 'act', 'WWII', 'trust', 'eurozone', 'push', 'VRT', 'December', 'appropriation', 'foundations', 'time', 'table', '€']",2026-01-22,2026-01-23,rt.com

De Wever made the comments while explaining why his country is opposing a European Union reparations loan to Ukraine.,Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has warned that the theft of Russian assets would be considered an act of war by Moscow. De Wever made the comments while explaining why his country is opposing a European Union reparations loan to Ukraine.If the frozen Russian assets currently being held in the European Union are dispersed  the government of Russia would consider that a war declaration.According to a report by RT  Western nations froze an estimated $300 billion in Russian central bank assets following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The bulk of the funds  which amount to approximately $216 billion  is currently being held in Belgium-based depository Euroclear. Belgian officials have staunchly opposed an EU scheme which would have leveraged the money as collateral for a €90 billion ($105 billion) “reparations loan” for Kiev.Luckily  the European Commission failed last month to secure the backing of bloc leaders for the plan  opting instead to raise common debt. Instead of choosing to simply stop funding Ukraine’s war efforts  the European Commission helped boost inflation and indebted its own bloc. It was a better choice than a war with Russia; however  simply removing funding from Kiev would have been the easiest and most peaceful solution.Ukraine Begins Another Effort To Seize Russian Assets For WeaponsSpeaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  on Thursday  De Wever said that “you cannot simply confiscate money – that is an act of war.

Kyrgyzstan also plans to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by $300 million in gold reserves.Advertisement: Scroll to ContinueZhao left Binance in 2023 after the U.S. Justice Department accused him of violating the Bank Secrecy Act. He was later pardoned by the Trump administration. He wasn’t the only crypto-world figure talking up tokenization at Davos this week.“While artificial intelligence has dominated headlines  the discussion  ‘Is Tokenization the Future? ’ made clear that tokenization work has continued steadily in the background  setting the stage for broader embrace ” PYMNTS wrote Tuesday (Jan. 22).Among the panelists was Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong  who said tokenization addresses structural inefficiencies in the financial system  especially around settlement speed  fees and access. He added that while tokenization enables real-time settlement and lower fees its most powerful impact is widening participation in investment markets.The CEO underlined what he described as a global “unbrokered” population — the approximately 4 billion adults who lack access to invest in high-quality assets — and pointed to stablecoins as the first successful expression of tokenization’s potential.“From his perspective  stablecoins demonstrate how tokenized representations of assets can unlock broader participation across borders ” the report added.Meanwhile  Euroclear CEO Valérie Urbain painted tokenization not as a rupture with existing market structures  but as a normal evolution that expands access while reducing costs.Tokenization  she argued  can “reach out to a bigger range of investors” while also helping issuers by “reducing the time to market” and “reducing the cost of issuing.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['Ex-Binance CEO Planning Tokenization Project', 'Several Countries', 'Euroclear CEO Valérie Urbain', 'U.S. Justice Department', 'Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong', 'World Economic Forum', 'social media posts', 'Bank Secrecy Act', 'global “unbrokered” population', 'first successful expression', 'existing market structures', 'unlimited free access', 'marketing communications', 'Privacy Policy', 'additional logins', 'small portions', 'nationalized businesses', 'real estate', 'blockchain-based tokens', 'fractional ownership', 'financial gains', 'national currency', 'gold reserves', 'Trump administration', 'crypto-world figure', 'artificial intelligence', 'broader embrace', 'structural inefficiencies', 'financial system', 'settlement speed', 'real-time settlement', 'powerful impact', 'investment markets', '4 billion adults', 'tokenized representations', 'normal evolution', 'bigger range', 'dozen governments', 'state-owned assets', 'CoinDesk notes', 'real-world assets', 'dollar-pegged stablecoin', 'high-quality assets', 'broader participation', 'PYMNTS content', 'several countries', 'Changpeng Zhao', 'tokenization work', 'Binance', 'founder', 'discussion', 'form', 'sharing', 'sponsor', 'accordance', 'Terms', 'Conditions', 'article', 'panel', 'Davos', 'effort', 'Jan.', 'report', 'concept', 'funds', 'citizens', 'investors', 'way', 'stakes', 'infrastructure', 'commodities', 'industries', 'talks', 'Pakistan', 'Malaysia', 'Kyrgyzstan', 'Advertisement', 'headlines', 'Future', 'background', 'stage', 'fees', 'stablecoins', 'potential', 'perspective', 'borders', 'rupture', 'costs', 'issuers']",2026-01-22,2026-01-23,pymnts.com

(Euronext: ONWD – US ADR: ONWRY)  the neurotechnology company pioneering spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence  announces that two additional individuals living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) have received the Company’s investigational ARC-BCI® Therapy. These groundbreaking procedures bring the total number of human implants to seven  extending the Company’s leadership in the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) platforms to restore thought-driven movement for people living with paralysis.Both procedures were performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne  Switzerland  under the direction of Jocelyne Bloch  MD  Chief of Neurosurgery. They involved a 35-year-old woman who sustained a spinal cord injury two years ago and a 39-year-old man who sustained a spinal cord injury seven years ago. Study participants received ARC-BCI Therapy for upper- and lower-limb movement restoration  respectively.“We continue to learn from this groundbreaking clinical feasibility research  leveraging our unique understanding of spinal cord stimulation to restore movement after paralysis  and exploring the potential advantages offered by the addition of a brain-computer interface ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. “We look forward to sharing more details in a peer-reviewed forum  continuing our commitment to scientific rigor.”The Company’s BCI platform comprises an implant placed epidurally on the motor cortex  designed to record brain signals associated with movement intention. The system uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decode these signals and translate them into instructions that are wirelessly transmitted to an implanted neurostimulator  which precisely stimulates targeted regions of the spinal cord via purpose-designed leads. The Company’s BCI is supported by more than eight years of human safety data. The ARC-BCI System was awarded Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2024. ARC-BCI is also included in the FDA’s Total Product Life Cycle Advisory Program that provides early regulatory guidance to support the development of innovative technologies.These latest implants are part of ongoing clinical feasibility studies supported by grants from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program through the European Innovation Council (EIC  under grant agreements No 101057450 and 101070891)  the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation  and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education  Research and Innovation (SERI).About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and other movement disabilities. Building on decades of scientific discovery  preclinical research  and clinical studies conducted at leading hospitals  rehabilitation clinics  and neuroscience laboratories  the Company developed its proprietary ARC Therapy.

Today  Societe Generale has submitted a project for organizational simplification in France to the employee representative bodies.Close to 2 000 employees participated in a Group-wide collaborative initiative  generating several thousand ideas to optimize tools and procurement  simplify processes and structures  pool teams  and strengthen automation and the use of artificial intelligence.These initiatives are accompanied by a proposed organizational evolution in France  which concerns several activities and central functions at headquarters  as well as the regional organization of Retail Banking (the branch network is not affected)  with the aim of simplifying our operating methods to make them more efficient  empowering and agile in serving clients.By leveraging natural attrition and an innovative social framework that invests in internal mobility and the development of employees’ skills  the Group would reduce the net number of positions by 1 800. This change would occur within the framework of the measures set out in the Employment Agreement signed on 15 December 2025 with three trade unions  without any redundancy plan  favoring internal career moves within the Bank’s many professions.Career-long training would be strengthened through Societe Generale University. At the same time  a Mobility and Skills Campus would be established to facilitate internal mobility  create bridges among the Group’s various entities  promoting diverse career paths and the transition to new roles.Following consultation with the employee representative bodies  the planned changes would be implemented gradually in 2026 and 2027 for the activities concerned and potentially beyond for Retail Banking in France.Press contacts:Jean-Baptiste Froville_+33 1 58 98 68 00_ jean-baptiste.froville@socgen.comAmandine Grison_+33 1 41 45 92 40_amandine.grison@socgen.comSociete GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with around 119 000 employees serving more than 26 million clients in 62 countries across the world.

The annual organic growth rate is expected to reach 5% or more in 2028  accompanied by an improvement in the operating margin  which should reach a record level of 13.5% in that same year.Ipsos' strategy relies on six pillars:1. Harnessing the full potential of its broad range of servicesIpsos' multi-specialist model allows it to offer solutions that meet the informational needs of numerous clients on a variety of topics and across multiple geographies. Ipsos will actively operate these services  particularly those with the most significant potential.2.

Delivering faster  with the same reliabilityIpsos will evolve its platforms and processes to significantly speed up delivery.

Leveraging its mastery of AI as a differentiating leverIpsos will increase its investments in Artificial Intelligence to gain speed  agility  and productivity without compromising data quality and relevance of analysis.5. Further developing its proprietary panels to ensure reliabilityAccess to real respondents is a key differentiator and competitive advantage for Ipsos.

Enabling decision-making with high value informationBy transforming data into impactful and actionable insights  Ipsos aims to be the indispensable partner for its clients when they must make rapid  well-informed and value-generating decisions.These strategic pillars support a clear ambition: to make Ipsos the AI augmented Global Market Research leader. Drawing on its deep understanding of Society  Markets and People  the company aims to assert its status as the global leader and be the champion of producing and delivering actionable  impactful insights.This ambition relies on two growth drivers: on the one hand  reinventing our services by leveraging AI to transform ways of working and delivering faster; on the other hand  enriching our portfolio by maximizing the adoption of high-potential services and exploring new growth opportunities.The implementation of this plan will rely on:A robust investment program in tech  AI  and data : Ipsos will invest more than 1 billion euros in transformational operations over the next five years  primarily through acquisitions and strategic investments. The investment plan will be mainly funded by free cash flow. Naturally  acquisitions will accelerate and strengthen Ipsos' operational capabilities and its expansion in the data integration and analytics market.: Ipsos will invest more than 1 billion euros in transformational operations over the next five years  primarily through acquisitions and strategic investments.

Enhanced training for teams to ensure they have the skills needed to deliver Ipsos’ operational capability improvement programs and the development of its analytical capabilities.Jean Laurent Poitou  CEO of Ipsos  states: « We are at a pivotal moment. The opportunities presented by tech and AI will allow us to build on our strengths and further reinforce our model to become an “Augmented Ipsos”.

Under these conditions  the cost of our debt  currently 2.10%  would be approximately 3%.”2025 Financial performance2025 key figures:Consolidated income statement Dec. 31  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Change Rental income €212.0m €198.3m +7% Net income – Group share €245.2m €245.7m Stable Recurring net income – Group share €154.8m €136.7m +13% Net income / share – Group share €9.61 €10.0 -4% Recurring net income / share – Group share €6.02 €5.5 +8% Valuation indicators Dec. 31  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Change Portfolio valuation excluding duties €4.07Bn €3.91Bn +4% EPRA NAV NTA per share €91.53 €85.5 +7% EPRA NAV NRV per share €103.52 €96.7 +7% EPRA NAV NDV per share €92.72 €87.5 +6%Debt indicators Dec. 31  2025 Dec. 31  2024 Change EPRA LTV 41.1% 43.1% -200 bps EPRA LTV (incl. duties) 38.6% 40.7% -210 bps Net debt / EBITDA 8.5x 9.2x -0.7x Cost of debt 2.10% 2.25% -15 bpsThe 2025 annual consolidated financial statements were approved by ARGAN’s Executive Board onJanuary 19  2026 and by the Supervisory Board on January 21  2026. The audit procedures performed by the statutory auditors on these consolidated financial statements have been completed. The audit report will be issued after completion of the specific verification procedures.Strong increase in financial resultsARGAN continued to demonstrate the strength of its value creation model  with solid growth in rental income (+7%) and an acceleration in Group share recurring net income (+13%). These results once again highlight the Group’s ability to convert its strong performance into robust cash flows  supported in particular by disciplined debt management.Rental income: up +7% in 2025Growth in rental income was solid in 2025 (+7%) with €212 million over 12 months. Sustained growth over the period primarily came from the full-year impact of 8 deliveries in 2024 as well rent indexation (+3.45 %) at January 1  2025.Occupancy over 99%The portfolio occupancy rate stood at over 99%  thereby extending ARGAN’s track record of warehouse occupancy above 99% over the past ten years (even as the national vacancy rate stood at 6.3% at year-end 2025  according to CBRE). The EPRA vacancy rate is 1%.Acceleration in the Group share recurring net income: +13 %Recurring net income attributable to the Group accelerated sharply  rising by 13% to €154.8 million atyear-end 2025  with a record margin of 73% of rental income. ARGAN therefore ended 2025 above its target of €152 million4. As a reminder  recurring net income is the best measure of the Group’s cash generation and reflects ARGAN’s ability to continue financing its development model.The effect related to the change in the fair value of the property portfolio was once again  with an impact of +€91 million  in a context of still-stable capitalization rates. Group share net income  which includes this effect  therefore remained significantly positive at €245.2 million over the twelve-month period.Ongoing growth in portfolio valuation and NAV EPRA NTAA Premium portfolio appraised at a rate of 5.25% (excl. duties) at €4.07Bn up +4% over 12 monthsThe delivered portfolio (excluding properties under development) stood at 3 770 000 sq.m atDecember 31  2025. Its appraisal stood at €4.07 billion excluding duties (€4.33 billion including duties)  up +4% from December 31  2024.The valuation of the delivered portfolio shows a capitalization rate of 5.25% (excluding duties)  broadly stable compared with 5.20% as of December 31  2024. The EPRA net initial yield (including duties) stood at 4.95%  very close to the national prime yield of 4.90% (source: CBRE as of December 31  2025)  thereby reflecting the PREMIUM quality of our assets.The average residual lease term was 5.0 years vs. 5.3 years at December 31  2024.The weighted average age of the portfolio was 12.4 years.NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA) at €91.5 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €103.5 € per share at December 31  2025 (+7% over one year).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €91.5 per share at December 31  2025 (+7% over one year).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €92.7 per share at December 31  2025 (+6% over one year).More specifically  the change in NTA (continuation NAV) over the year represented an increase of €6.0 per share compared with December 31  2024  driven by net income per share (+€6.0)  a positive change in the value of the property portfolio (+€3.6)  cash dividend payments (–€2.5) and scrip dividend payments (–€1.1)Debt under controlARGAN continued to reduce its debt. At December 31  2025  it presented following ratios:LTV EPRA ratio (excluding duties) of 41.1% vs. 43.1%;Net debt on EBITDA ratio of 8.5X vs. 9.2X.ARGAN gross financial debt stood at €1.7 billion at the end of 2025. Net debt was also at €1.7 billion  after netting cash and cash equivalents at December 31  2025.The average cost of debt as of December 31  2025 remains low at 2.10%  down from 2.25% as ofDecember 31  2024  with an average maturity of 4.0 years.Debt structure limits risks  as it is mostly incurred with fixed or hedged variable rates:60 % fixed-rate debt;39 % of hedged variable debt;Only 1% of non-hedged variable debt.2026 : a year in line with 2025  with rental income expected up +4%2026 targetsIndicators 2026targets 2025Actual data Changevs. 2025 Rental income €220m €212m +4% Group share recurring net income / share ~€6 €6.0 Stable EPRA LTV ratio ~40%5 41.1% ~-1 pt Net debt / EBITDA 8.5x 8.5x Stable Dividend per share €3.656 €3.457 +6%Following a year of strong growth in 2025  ARGAN is targeting 4% growth in rental income  supported by a significant project pipeline with approximately €165 million to be delivered. 2026 will be a year marked by the refinancing of the 2021 bond issue (€500m with a 1.01% coupon): the timing of the future bond issuance and its coupon will determine the trend in recurring net income per share  with stability targeted compared with 2025 (€6 per share).A sizeable investment planClose to €165 million secured investments for 2026After having delivered €55 million for 70 000 sq.m of newly built area in 20258 at a yield of 7.2% for €4 million of yearly additional rents  ARGAN intends to keep on strengthening its portfolio with close to€165 million of investments to be delivered in 2026  at a yield above 6%  over 8 projects  including three asset acquisitions.With the deliveries scheduled for 2026  major tenants will join ARGAN’s client portfolio  including Danone  Ferrero and Puma.Thereafter  ARGAN will continue to strengthen its portfolio by investing around €150m per year to support its long-term growth (approximately +4% per year)  while continuing to roll out its AutOnom® warehouse concept  which produces its own energy on site.Refinancing of our €500 million bond debtMaturity of a €500 million bondNovember 2026 marks the maturity of a €500 million bond issued in November 2021  with a 1.01% coupon. ARGAN will refinance this maturity through a new bond issuance  with a targeted amount in the range of €500m to €700m between April and October 2026  depending on market conditions. This issuance could be split into two tranches with different maturities.Under current market conditions  the coupon of the future bond issuance could be in the range of 3% to 4%  levels at which ARGAN would still be well positioned to generate a strong recurring net income margin and thus maintain robust cash flow. Depending on the refinancing conditions (timing and rates)  ARGAN expects Group share recurring net income per share to be close to €6  broadly stable compared with 2025.A secure financial framework to refinance under optimal conditionsIn preparation for the refinancing of its bond issuance  the Company has put in place the necessary resources to fully control the timing and execution conditions. To this end  it has arranged a €500 million bridge-to-loan facility available until November 2027  while significantly strengthening its available liquidity through an increase in its revolving credit facilities (RCF)  expanded from €300 million to €400 million over the course of one year. These measures provide ARGAN with enhanced financial flexibility  enabling it to select the most favourable market window to carry out this transaction under optimal conditions.ARGAN will provide an outlook beyond 2026 once this refinancing maturity has passed.Continued steady growth in the dividendAs part of its shareholder return policy  ARGAN continues to increase the dividend per share. Accordingly  the Company will propose at the 2026 Annual General Meeting to be held on March 26 a dividend of €3.45 per share  up 5% year-on-year  to be paid exclusively in cash. ARGAN then intends to propose a dividend of€3.65 per share for fiscal year 2026 at the 2027 Annual General Meeting  representing an increase of 6% compared with the previous year.ESG roadmap: new progress madeAutOnom  our « star » warehouse that produces its own energyARGAN continues to enhance the sustainability of its portfolio by systematically deploying across all new projects its AutOnom® warehouse concept  which produces its own energy on site and delivers a significant reduction in operational carbon emissions compared with a standard warehouse.The Company is also installing electric heat pumps at existing sites  with nearly €3 million invested in 2025 (generating rental yield) and 2 100 tonnes of CO₂ avoided per year across six projects.All these efforts have already made it possible to achieve more than 50% of the target to divide by twoScope 3 CO₂ emissions related to energy consumption across the portfolio’s warehouses. These emissions are expected to decrease from approximately 25 000 tonnes in 2022 to around 12 500 tonnes by 2030.French State label “companies committed to nature”In 2025  the French State recognized the quality of ARGAN’s biodiversity approach through the award of the ‘Companies Committed to Nature’ label. Structured around eight ambitious objectives  ARGAN’s biodiversity strategy aims in particular to limit negative externalities related to the Group’s developments  notably through reforestation initiatives and the implementation of measures to protect flora and fauna.Improvement in ratings from non-financial rating agenciesARGAN’s non-financial rating continued to improve in 2025  marked by a successful first assessment by GRESB  which awarded a strong score of 83/100. In addition  other rating agencies maintained their very positive assessments while further improving their scores  namely a ‘low risk’ rating from Sustainalytics (16.1)  a Gold Medal from EthiFinance (83/100) and a Silver Medal from EcoVadis (73/100).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 26: General Assembly 2026April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 23: Half-year results 2026October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20262027 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 4: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2026quarter 2026 January 21: Annual results 2026March 25: General Assembly 2027About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.
