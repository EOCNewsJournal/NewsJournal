An Extraordinary General Meeting to authorise the distribution of the net proceeds of the sale of the Defence Business to Leonardo S.p.A.

The common and special voting shares of this company would be proportionally allotted to Iveco Group shareholders existing at the time of the demerger  with common shares listed and traded on Euronext Milan. The Defence EGM will be asked to vote on the demerger proposal as a precautionary measure.Tender OfferThe voluntary tender offer for the issued common shares after the separation of defence (the “Tender Offer”)  is expected to complete in the first half of 2026 as planned. This is based on the information received from Tata Motors Limited (NSE: TATAMOTORS) and is conditional upon the separation of the Defence Business as noted above. In relation to the Tender Offer  Company currently anticipates convening an Extraordinary General Meeting in early May to adopt the resolutions summarised in the Offeror’s Notice (by which on 30th July 2025 TML CV HS  pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 102  paragraph 1  of the Italian CFA and Article 37 of Consob Issuers' Regulation  informed Consob and disclosed to the market and the issuer its decision to promote the Tender Offer).As per applicable rules  pending publication of the Offer Document  the legal basis  terms  price and key elements of the Tender Offer are available in the Offeror’s Notice. The Offeror’s Notice has been published on behalf of TML CV HS on the website of Tata Motors at www.tatamotors.com and on the Company’s website at www.ivecogroup.com.2025 Industrial Free Cash Flow below latest forecastThe financial results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 (preliminary and unaudited figures) will be presented on Thursday  12th February 2026.Based on the operational preview of the 2025 financial results  the Company currently foresees all financial targets will come in at or just slightly below guidance with the exception of Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities. Despite an expected solid Q4 2025 Free Cash Flow performance  FY 2025 Industrial Free Cash Flow is currently estimated at about €60 million  compared to the guidance issued on 6th November 2025 of between €250 million - €350 million. The main reason for this is lower-than-forecasted Free Cash Flow performance in the Bus segment during the fourth quarter due to ramp-up cost and production delays. Actions already in place are expected to enable a recovery in 2026.* * *Important information.

Following the positive COAST 1 (clinical study identifier: NCT06130566) results in September 2025  two additional global phase 3 studies – SHORE (clinical study identifier: NCT06224348) and COAST 2 (clinical study identifier: NCT06181435) – of amlitelimab  a fully human non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that selectively targets OX40-ligand (OX40L)  today delivered a robust body of evidence that supports amlitelimab’s potential in the treatment of patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In these two phase 3 studies amlitelimab was well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported data.""Importantly  these results validate amlitelimab’s novel mechanism of action to block OX40-ligand without T-cell depletion and its promise to normalize the immune system over time "" said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research & Development at Sanofi. ""The totality of data seen to date reinforce our confidence in amlitelimab’s potential to deliver both Q12W dosing from the start and progressive efficacy through Week 52. We look forward to sharing additional results  including longer-term data  as we move toward global regulatory submissions.”For both SHORE and COAST 2 phase 3 studies  key endpoints were measured at Week 24 in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD who received amlitelimab either every four weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks (Q12W). For US and US reference countries  the single primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a validated investigator global assessment scale for AD (vIGA-AD) of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points  analyzed using non-responder imputation (US estimand). For the EU  EU reference countries and Japan  the co-primary endpoints comprised the proportion of patients with vIGA-AD 0/1 and a reduction from baseline score of ≥2 points along with the proportion of patients reaching a 75% or greater improvement in the eczema area and severity index total score (EASI-75)  both analyzed using treatment policy (EU estimand).SHORE studyIn the SHORE study  amlitelimab  dosed either Q4W or Q12W in conjunction with medium-potency background topical corticosteroids (TCS) with or without topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)  met all primary and key secondary endpoints compared to placebo plus TCS with or without TCI at Week 24  across both US and EU estimands.SHORE primary endpoints Key endpointsProportion of patients Non-responder imputation*+(US estimand) Treatment policy**+(EU estimand) Q4W Q12W Placebo Q4W Q12W Placebo vIGA-AD 0/1 28.7%p-value (p)p≤0.0132.3%p ≤0.01 16.8%29.9%p≤0.01 32.9%p≤0.01 16.8%EASI-75 48.1%p≤0.01 46.8%p≤0.025 32.3%50.9%p≤0.001 48.1%p≤0.025 34.2%* Non-responder imputation (NRI): patients with rescue or prohibited medication use before Week 24 or with missing efficacy assessments at Week 24 are classified as non-responders.** Treatment policy: all data are included regardless of rescue medication use prior to Week 24.

The key secondary endpoint of the proportion of patients who achieved vIGA-AD 0/1 with barely perceptible erythema (BPE)  as assessed for the US and US reference countries  did not achieve statistical significance. For the EU and EU reference countries  amlitelimab dosed either Q4W or Q12W did not achieve statistical significance for the co-primary endpoints of proportion of patients achieving vIGA-AD 0/1 and EASI-75 compared to placebo. Therefore  in accordance with hierarchical statistical testing procedures  p-values presented below for additional secondary endpoints reflect nominal significance without adjustment for multiplicity.COAST 2 primary endpoints Key endpointsProportion of patients Non-responder imputation*+(US estimand) Treatment policy**+(EU estimand) Q4W Q12W Placebo Q4W Q12W Placebo vIGA-AD 0/1 25.3%p≤0.02525.7%p≤0.025 14.8% 28.8%p=0.031 27.7%p=0.068 18.8% EASI-75 41.8%p≤0.001*** 40.5%p≤0.01*** 24.2% 49.7%p≤0.001*** 45.9%p≤0.01*** 30.2%* Non-responder imputation (NRI): patients with rescue or prohibited medication use before Week 24 or with missing efficacy assessments at Week 24 are classified as non-responders.** Treatment policy: all data are included regardless of rescue medication use prior to Week 24.

Overall  rates of TEAEs  serious adverse events  and TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were similar in the pooled amlitelimab arms and placebo arm.The most common TEAEs in COAST 2 (≥5% in any dose arm; pooled amlitelimab vs. placebo) were nasopharyngitis (5.9% vs 7.4%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4.8% vs 4.0%)  dermatitis atopic (5.3% vs 2.7%). Overall  rates of TEAEs  serious adverse events  and TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were similar in the pooled amlitelimab and placebo arms.Preliminary analysis from ATLANTIS phase 2 open-label studyIn addition  a preliminary analysis of the ongoing  open-label ATLANTIS phase 2 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05769777) indicated that amlitelimab dosed Q4W progressively improved skin clearance and disease severity beyond Week 24 to Week 52 in 591 patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. In this preliminary analysis  amlitelimab was well-tolerated through Week 52.ATLANTIS preliminary analysis Key endpoints Proportion of patients Week 24 Week 52 vIGA-AD 0/135.4% 50.3% EASI-75 62.9% 76.5%Patients with missing data are classified as non-responders. Concomitant use of TCS with or without TCI is allowed as needed2. Short-term (<4 weeks) oral corticosteroids rescue therapy is permitted.The most common TEAEs in this preliminary analysis of ATLANTIS (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (19.1%)  headache (10.3%)  influenza (9.1%)  dermatitis atopic (8.6%)  upper respiratory tract infection (7.2%) and accidental overdose (5.1%  due to dose scheduling). Serious TEAEs and TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation at Week 52 were low  4.7% and 2.9% respectively. In addition  an event of Kaposi’s sarcoma  determined to be cutaneous  was reported in a patient with known risk factors. The patient stopped amlitelimab and is in the recovery phase.Results for COAST 1  COAST 2  SHORE  and this preliminary analysis of ATLANTIS will be presented at forthcoming medical congresses.Two additional phase 3 studies  AQUA (clinical study identifier: NCT06241118) and ESTUARY (clinical study identifier: NCT06407934) are anticipated to report results in H2 2026. Global regulatory submissions are planned for H2 2026  unchanged.Amlitelimab is currently in clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the SHORE studySHORE was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  3-arm  multinational  multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab in combination TCS with or without TCI in 596 participants aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Key objectives include measuring the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab compared to placebo at Week 24 when used in combination with TCS/TCI. In the study  amlitelimab was administered at a dose of 250 mg (125 mg for those with body weight <40 kg) on either a Q4W or Q12W schedule following a loading dose of 500 mg (250 mg for those with body weight <40 kg). Patients were given medium-potency TCS/TCI  applied up to twice daily to treat active lesions  and were instructed to reduce the dose to three times weekly or discontinue use based on lesion control or clearance. The study included sites across the North America  EU  Argentina  Chile  Brazil  Turkey  Canada  China  and Japan.About the COAST 2 studyCOAST 2 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  3-arm  global  multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab monotherapy in 547 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Key objectives included measuring the efficacy and safety of amlitelimab compared to placebo at Week 24. In the study  amlitelimab was administered at a dose of 250 mg (125 mg for those with body weight <40 kg) on either a Q4W or Q12W schedule following a loading dose of 500 mg (250 mg for those with body weight <40 kg). The study included sites across the US  EU  United Kingdom  Argentina  Chile  Mexico  South Africa  Turkey  China  and Japan.About the ATLANTIS studyATLANTIS is a phase 2 global  single-arm  open-label  long-term safety study of amlitelimab for the treatment of patients 12 years or older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) with a duration of up to 268 weeks. In the study  patients received weight-based amlitelimab Q4W (250 mg [125 mg for those with body weight <40 kg] following a loading dose of 500 mg [250 mg for those with body weight <40 kg]). The primary outcome measures of the ATLANTIS study are the percentage of participants who experienced TEAEs and TESAEs from baseline. Efficacy outcome measures included the proportion of patients with a vIGA-AD 0/1 and the proportion of participants achieving EASI-75. The study has enrolled 963 patients to date and includes sites across North America  Latin America  EU  United Kingdom  Turkey  South Africa  India  Australia  South Korea  Taiwan  China  and Japan.About amlitelimabAmlitelimab (SAR445229  KY1005) is a fully human  non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that blocks the OX40L  a key immune regulator.
