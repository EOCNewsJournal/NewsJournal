About a year ago  the firm initiated a strategic reset  asking a simple but fundamental question: what is the best way for customers to move assets fully onchain?Todd McDonald  R3’s co-founder  said that process coincided with a deep review of the blockchain landscape.STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

That work culminated in a strategic partnership with the Solana Foundation  announced last May at the blockchain's Accelerate conference  he said.A layer 1 network is the base layer  or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of offchain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.The decision  McDonald said  was grounded in a long-term conviction that all markets will ultimately become onchain markets.“We think Solana is the best network for that future ” he said  pointing to its structure  throughput and trading-first design. R3 came to see Solana as “the Nasdaq of blockchains ” a venue purpose-built for high-performance capital markets rather than general experimentation.Through its Corda blockchain platform  R3 supports more than $10 billion in assets and works with participants including HSBC  Bank of America  the Bank of Italy  the Monetary Authority of Singapore  the Swiss National Bank  Euroclear  SDX and SBI  he said.Tokenization  the process of representing real-world assets such as stocks and bonds as digital tokens tradable on blockchain networks  has emerged as one of the key use cases drawing growing interest and investment from traditional financial institutions.Activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) remains concentrated on a handful of chains  with Ethereum still the largest by total value locked (TVL)  reflecting its deep liquidity  broad developer ecosystem and institutional adoption. However  Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms  benefitting from high throughput  ultra-low fees and rapidly expanding user engagement.Recent data shows Solana’s DeFi ecosystem holding more than $9 billion in TVL  making it one of the top networks outside Ethereum and its Layer 2s  and in some periods rivaling the combined DeFi activity of major Ethereum L2s.Solana’s model has driven significantly higher onchain transaction volume and active wallets  especially for trading and high-frequency applications  even as Ethereum retains overall TVL dominance and the largest share of institutional assets.Since that pivot last May  R3 has spent the past eight to nine months almost entirely focused on one problem: how to tokenize the next trillion dollars of assets and bring them onchain in a way that actually works for investors. That means not just issuing tokens  but designing products that existing onchain allocators want to use  and that traditional investors can grow into over time.McDonald said R3 is already seeing a shift in focus on Solana toward capital formation and capital allocation  rather than pure speculation.Liquidity  McDonald argued  is the real bottleneck for tokenized real-world assets.“The beating heart of DeFi is borrow and lend ” he said. The breakthrough moment will come when a tokenized real-world asset can be treated as credible collateral on equal footing with native crypto assets. Today  limited liquidity  and in some cases rigid permissioning  discourages DeFi investors from engaging meaningfully with these products.Rather than forcing demand  R3 is starting from where onchain appetite already exists. McDonald pointed to boom-and-bust cycles and notes that many sophisticated investors are now looking for yield that is more stable and less correlated to crypto markets.“We’re trying to bring these assets onchain and package them in a DeFi-native way ” he said  while working closely with existing allocators to improve access.The firm’s asset focus reflects that strategy. R3 is prioritizing higher-yielding products  with private credit as a core pillar.“You need a headline yield to get attention ” McDonald said  noting that returns around 10% tend to resonate strongly with onchain investors. At the same time  these products must balance return  liquidity and composability; a challenge given that private credit liquidity is often quarterly or “by appointment” in traditional markets.Beyond private credit  R3 sees significant opportunity in trade finance  where McDonald said demand and supply are highly elastic.“If DeFi allocators really leaned into trade finance  the supply from the traditional world is enormous ” he explains  pointing to the sheer scale of the market and the potential for sustainable returns.Trade finance is notoriously opaque  spanning fragmented jurisdictions  bespoke contracts and uneven data standards  which makes risk difficult to price  assets hard to standardize and liquidity slow to scale despite the market’s enormous size.On the issuer side  R3 is already working with household-name investment managers  alongside a longer tail of asset owners  from factories to shipping firms  who see tokenization as a new distribution channel and a new model for capital formation. The aim is not just to mirror off chain products  but to redesign them so they are investable  tradable and composable onchain.Improving liquidity will also require more risk capital deployed directly onchain. McDonald said that while there are large native DeFi players today  participation remains narrow.“We need more diversity of balance sheets willing to put capital to work ” he said  alongside more flexible redemption mechanisms that give investors genuine choice.That vision underpins R3’s newly announced Corda Protocol. Built natively on Solana  the protocol introduces professionally curated  real-world-asset-backed yield vaults that issue liquid  redeemable vault tokens. Launching in the first half of 2026  the vaults are designed to give stablecoin holders access to tokenized debt instruments  funds and reinsurance-linked securities  without sacrificing DeFi-style liquidity or composability.""Assets available through Corda will be supported by protocol-native liquidity layer  enabling instant swaps out of otherwise illiquid or liquidity-constrained assets for onchain investors. This unlocks the use of the assets as collateral at scale. The protocol will be integrated with top curators and lending protocols to power borrowing and levered position building "" McDonald said.In a sign of strong early demand  Corda has received more than 30 000 pre-registrations to date.He framed the effort as a direct response to a growing gap in the market. As DeFi investors move away from purely speculative strategies  demand is rising for stable  diversified yield that is uncorrelated with crypto markets. While hundreds of billions of dollars in real-world assets are now represented onchain  most institutional-grade yield still forces capital to move off chain.“Our goal is to close that gap ” McDonald said. “To bring Wall Street-quality assets onchain in a way that finally makes sense for DeFi  and to bring off chain capital into onchain markets at scale.”Read more: ‘DeFi is dead’: Maple Finance’s CEO says onchain markets will swallow Wall Street",neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,mixed,0.23,0.3,0.47,True,English,"['R3 bets', 'institutional yield', 'Solana', 'onchain', 'past eight to nine months', 'Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter', 'a decade building infrastructure', 'next trillion dollars', 'broad developer ecosystem', 'many sophisticated investors', 'A layer 1 network', 'Corda blockchain platform', 'native crypto assets', 'Swiss National Bank', 'overall TVL dominance', 'high-performance capital markets', 'onchain transaction volume', 'major Ethereum L2s', 'growing DeFi platforms', 'traditional financial institutions', 'tokenized real-world assets', 'institutional capital markets', 'key use cases', 'private credit liquidity', 'crypto markets', 'underlying infrastructure', 'best network', 'growing interest', 'capital formation', 'capital allocation', 'traditional markets', 'DeFi ecosystem', 'institutional adoption', 'traditional investors', 'traditional world', 'institutional assets', 'central banks', 'new direction', 'strategic reset', 'fundamental question', 'deep review', 'privacy policy', 'strategic partnership', 'Accelerate conference', 'offchain systems', 'long-term conviction', 'trading-first design', 'general experimentation', 'Monetary Authority', 'decentralized finance', 'total value', 'ultra-low fees', 'user engagement', 'Recent data', 'active wallets', 'high-frequency applications', 'largest share', 'one problem', 'pure speculation', 'real bottleneck', 'beating heart', 'breakthrough moment', 'credible collateral', 'equal footing', 'rigid permissioning', 'bust cycles', 'existing allocators', 'core pillar', 'significant opportunity', 'trade finance', 'layer twos', 'base layer', 'layer 1s', 'Layer 2s', 'DeFi investors', 'DeFi allocators', 'blockchain landscape', 'blockchain networks', 'deep liquidity', 'limited liquidity', 'onchain markets', 'best way', 'DeFi-native way', 'onchain allocators', 'onchain investors', 'separate blockchains', 'digital tokens', 'high throughput', 'top networks', 'asset focus', 'headline yield', 'same time', 'higher-yielding products', 'DeFi activity', 'Todd McDonald', 'Solana Foundation', 'CoinDesk products', 'exchanges', 'R3', 'firm', 'simple', 'customers', 'founder', 'process', 'STORY', 'newsletters', 'emails', 'terms', 'interview', 'decision', 'future', 'Nasdaq', 'venue', 'participants', 'HSBC', 'Italy', 'Singapore', 'Euroclear', 'SDX', 'SBI', 'Tokenization', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'investment', 'handful', 'periods', 'model', 'pivot', 'shift', 'demand', 'appetite', 'boom', 'access', 'strategy', 'attention', 'returns', 'composability', 'challenge', 'appointment', 'supply', 'she']",2026-01-24,2026-01-25,coindesk.com
