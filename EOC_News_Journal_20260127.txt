Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  the EU and the G7 nations froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros.

(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") announces that its subsidiary  AMG LIVA  will install its industrial battery  namely the Hybrid Energy Storage System (“Hybrid ESS”)  at Aramco’s Bulk Plant in Tabuk  Saudi Arabia. LIVA’s Hybrid ESS is an ecosystem combining Lithium-Ion and Vanadium Redox Flow batteries (“VRFB”) with artificial intelligence routines and self-learning algorithms to help increase efficiency  safety  reliability  and lifetime of the batteries. The Hybrid ESS will be integrated into an existing solar plant at Aramco’s facility in Tabuk.Showcasing that LIVA’s Hybrid ESS can help reduce the carbon emissions of the energy supply and potentially support independence from the grid at any time of the day is aimed at supporting the Kingdom’s 2030 Vision in advancing carbon emissions reduction goals  increasing the deployment of renewable energy  and enhancing energy storage capabilities.This initiative compliments the strategy contemplated by the IK Metals Reclamation and Catalyst Manufacturing Project  referred to as “IK Supercenter.” The IK Supercenter is a mega recycling facility and  pursuant to a joint venture between Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. together with their local partner  the United Company for Industry (UCI)  the Advanced Circular Materials Company was formed to build the IK Supercenter. This facility aims to target the recycling of metals  including vanadium concentrate from spent catalysts  and gasification ashes from Aramco’s Jazan Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Plant. The recycling approach of the facility helps reduce the carbon emissions of the active material compared to a classic mining process. The IK Supercenter is set to include a vanadium electrolyte production plant that is expected to supply the Kingdom’s vanadium flow battery market  supporting a fully integrated  made-in-KSA value chain.About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world. To this end  AMG is focused on the production and development of energy storage materials such as lithium  vanadium  and tantalum. In addition  AMG's products include highly engineered systems to reduce CO 2 in aerospace engines  as well as critical materials addressing CO 2 reduction in a variety of other end use markets.AMG’s Lithium segment spans the lithium value chain  reducing the CO 2 footprint of both suppliers and customers.

Operating performance should improve gradually  driven by increased industrial synergies and a focus on key technologies.Egide Group (Euronext Growth Paris™ - ISIN: FR0000072373 - Ticker: ALGID)  a worldwide provider of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components  has released its 2025 revenue figures with consolidated revenue reaching €31.34m  which is 4% higher than in 2024 (€30.01m). This performance confirms that the Group is able to deliver sustainable growth from its higher-tech activities  particularly in the field of critical thermal imaging applications.“2025 was a decisive year for the Group’s value creation strategy. Our thermal imaging segment generated rapid growth and our European activities bounced back strongly  thus confirming that we have made the right industrial and commercial choices. We are pursuing efforts to ensure our French and US operations complement each other more effectively so that we can focus our resources on the critical defense  optronics and aerospace markets. Egide is beginning 2026 on the right track  with a product mix that will contribute more to its performance and a better-diversified customer portfolio.”Ignace Dupon  CEO of Egide GroupGovernance change in the second half of 2025The Group’s governance was greatly reinforced during the course of 2025.Ignace Dupon took over from David Hien as Egide Group’s Chief Executive Officer on August 1  2025 and has since focused his efforts on:ramping up the Group’s strategic segments bringing back key customers refocusing the Group’s activities on critical applications and optimizing the way in which the France/US activities are organized and interact with each other  in an effort to simplify operations and create value.The Combined General Meeting was held on September 10  2025  a few weeks after Ignace Dupon’s appointment  and approved the formation of a new Board of Directors which now includes:Philippe Bensussan  Chairman of the Board of Directors;Ignace Dupon  CEO  director;Sophie Lerond  director;SOGEFIP  represented by Michel Faure  director;Martin McCourt  independent director.This new Board offers a combination of industry expertise  strategic vision and international experience and is tasked with ensuring the Group’s strategy is executed  providing guidance on any structural portfolio adjustments made  optimizing transatlantic interaction and overseeing the industrial transformation underway within the Group.Strategic initiatives taken in 2025: a value-creating repositioning driveEgide Group continued to roll out various transformational initiatives in 2025 in order to speed up its value creation by:Refocusing on technology-intensive segmentsThe Group built on its positions in critical applications  especially in the following areas: thermal imaging (45% of revenue at December 31  2025)  which is Egide’s historical market and has become its main growth driver; thermal batteries; and firing systems.Reconfiguring its commercial set-up and regaining market share in EuropeThe momentum in Europe (+30%) was achieved by focusing more attention on strategic customers (in defense  optronics and semiconductors).Optimizing the product mixExposure to the most volatile segments was gradually scaled back in favor of higher-margin products.Generating industrial synergies between France/USATransatlantic synergies were reinforced to make the Group more competitive  reliable and quality-centric.Full-year 2025 consolidated revenue at €31.34mRevenue (€m)12/31/2025* 12/31/2024 Change Chg. at CER** €m % revenue €m % revenue €m % % Egide SA 16.50 53% 14.78 49% 1.72 12% 12% Egide USA 10.75 34% 8.30 28% 2.45 29% 35% Santier 4.09 13% 6.93 23% -2.84 -41% -38% Egide Group 31.34 100% 30.01 100% 1.33 4% 7%* Unaudited** At constant exchange ratesEgide SA’s business activity grew at a solid pace (+12%) in 2025  primarily driven by strong momentum in the thermal imaging segment which accounted for most of the entity’s annual growth. This performance was the result of efforts to move the product mix in France (thermal imaging and optronics) more upmarket. Egide SA’s 2025 revenue growth therefore reflects a very clear shift towards high-technology product lines (defense  optronics)  which is fully consistent with the strategy being rolled out across the Group.Egide USA achieved significant growth in its business activity  pushing its revenue up from €8.30m at December 31  2024 to €10.75m at December 31  2025 (+29%). This increase was mostly driven by highly technical applications  especially thermal imaging  thermal batteries and firing systems. It was achieved thanks to effective measures taken to diversify the portfolio and build on Egide USA’s positions with customers operating in the defense  security and aerospace sectors.Santier’s revenue dropped sharply from €6.93m in 2024 to €4.09m in 2025 (-€2.84m) as a direct consequence of certain high value-added programs with top-tier customers in the USA and Asia being discontinued.For information  the average euro / dollar exchange rate at December 31  2025 was 1.1293 versus 1.0821 at December 31  2024.Revenue by applicationRevenue (€m)12/31/2025* 12/31/2024 Change €m % revenue €m % revenue €m % Thermal Imaging 14.19 45% 9.08 30% 5.11 56% Power 5.36 17% 7.03 23% -1.67 -24% Optronics 2.77 9% 4.15 14% -1.38 -33% RF/MW 4.35 14% 5.75 19% -1.41 -24% Others 4.67 15% 4.00 13% 0.68 17% Egide Group 31.34 100% 30.01 100% 1.33 4%* UnauditedThe thermal imaging segment delivered robust growth at +56%  with its revenue jumping from €9.08m at December 31  2024 to €14.19m at December 31  2025. It is therefore now the Group’s leading segment  accounting for 45% of its unaudited 2025 consolidated revenue. The drive to refocus commercially on the European and US defense/optronics sectors is paying off in full  testament to the expertise and breadth of the differentiating technological solutions that Egide has to offer these markets.Momentum in the Group’s other applications varied as certain markets follow their own cycle and strategic portfolio adjustments were made to focus Egide’s attention on its more technology-intensive segments.Applications brought together in the “Others” category  which include technical solutions such as thermal batteries and specific firing systems  grew by +17% and were driven mainly by the defense sector.Revenue by regionRevenue (€m)12/31/2025* 12/31/2024 Change €m % revenue €m % revenue €m % North America 13.21 42% 13.89 46% -0.68 -5% Europe 10.39 33% 8.01 27% 2.38 30% Asia & ROW 7.74 25% 8.11 27% -0.37 -5% Egide Group 31.34 100% 30.01 100% 1.33 4%* UnauditedEurope remained the Group’s primary growth driver in 2025  largely thanks to a number of long-standing customers which are placing orders again  particularly in the thermal imaging segment. Although geopolitical developments in Europe have created a favorable backdrop for Egide  its impact on the Group’s business activity so far remains gradual and varies between programs.In the United States  Egide USA’s positive growth largely offset Santier’s negative growth  thus showing that the Group’s manufacturing facilities complement each other well and the portfolio is able to absorb differing trends from one site to another.2026 prioritiesIn keeping with the measures taken over the past two years  the Group continues to diversify its customer and product portfolios  steer certain mid-size accounts towards strategic customer status  and refocus on its key defense and aerospace technologies. The push to generate synergies between Egide’s different sites and consolidate its industrial expertise is geared towards improving the Group’s operational efficiency for the long term.2026 FINANCIAL CALENDARThe Group’s financial agenda for 2026 can be found on its website.Information Date 2025 full-year results April 27  2026 (after trading) Annual General Meeting June 2026 2026 half-year revenue July 27  2026 (before trading) 2026 half-year results October 19  2026 (before trading)About Egide - Keep up to date with all the Group’s news online: www.egide-group.com and LinkedInEgide is a group with an international dimension  specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.
