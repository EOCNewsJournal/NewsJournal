As of December 31  2025  $38.9 billion of this sum had already been allocated.At the end of 2024  the United States was the first to transfer $1 billion  but since then  no further payments have been reported. The EU was the largest contributor to the scheme  providing Ukraine with $21.1 billion in loans. The remaining funds came from Canada  the UK  and Japan. Apart from the G7 loan  Ukraine was handed an additional $12.1 billion from the EU  $454 million from Japan  $912 million from the International Monetary Fund  and $733 million from the World Bank in 2025. In total  the Ukrainian budget raked in $52.1 billion from foreign creditors last year  73% of which came from the G7 loan. With the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in 2022  EU and G7 members froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  totaling approximately 300 billion euros ($360 billion). Around 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets are held in European accounts  primarily at the Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear. The European Commission has been pressing EU members for the green light to use these frozen Russian assets to bankroll Kiev's war machine. The Kremlin has cautioned that any attempts to confiscate Russian assets would amount to theft and be in violation of international law.Following a summit in Brussels on December 19  2025  the EU opted to abandon its plans temporarily to seize Russian state assets and instead agreed to extend a 90-billion-euro loan to Ukraine from the EU budget. However  Hungary  Slovakia  and the Czech Republic refused to shoulder any responsibility for the loan.https://sputnikglobe.com/20260126/kremlin-says-seen-no-us-reaction-to-proposal-to-send-1bln-frozen-assets-to-board-of-peace-1123529799.htmlukrainerussiakievSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 602026Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalg7 countries  transfer to ukraine  russian assets  ukrainian budget,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'G7 Countries', 'Ukraine', 'Proceeds', 'Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear', 'kiev g7 international monetary fund', 'foreign currency reserves', 'world european union', 'The European Commission', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Russian state assets', 'assets assets', 'European accounts', 'The G7', 'foreign assets', 'World Bank', 'international law', 'G7 Hands', '2024 G7 plan', 'G7 members', 'g7 countries', 'Sputnik International', 'foreign financing', 'foreign creditors', 'The Kremlin', 'G7 loan', 'Ukrainian budget', 'United States', 'largest contributor', 'remaining funds', 'military operation', 'green light', 'war machine', 'Czech Republic', 'Rossiya Segodnya', '90-billion-euro loan', '200 billion euros', 'EU members', 'EU budget', '$50 billion loan', 'ukraine russia', '300 billion', 'sputnikglobe', 'g7-countries', 'bln', 'proceeds', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'loans', 'income', 'calculations', 'Wednesday', 'cdn1.', 'cc894500fb8172d2023ddbd9cfbaa53', 'December', 'sum', 'end', 'payments', 'scheme', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'total', 'start', 'half', 'attempts', 'theft', 'violation', 'Brussels', 'plans', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'responsibility', 'kremlin-says', 'reaction', 'peace', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'transfer']",2026-01-28,2026-01-29,sputnikglobe.com

(“SpaceX”)  the world’s preeminent aerospace manufacturer  space transport provider  and satellite communications leader.Following the successful financial stabilization achieved in 2025  Tonner Drones is transitioning into a phase of growth and portfolio optimization. This investment represents a significant milestone in the Company’s strategy to diversify its asset base and capture value within high-growth technological sectors.The investment is funded through a strategic reallocation of proceeds from the recently announced sale of Tonner Drones’ stake in Donecle. By deploying an initial portion of the €1.25 million proceeds into SpaceX  the Company is leveraging its liquidity to gain exposure to one of the most significant infrastructure providers in the future of aerospace.SpaceX is a pioneer in aerospace  currently dominating the global launch market with its flight-proven Falcon and Starship platforms. Through its Starlink constellation  SpaceX provides high-speed connectivity worldwide while building the critical infrastructure required for deep-space exploration.Tonner Drones has seized this opportunity ahead of a highly anticipated potential IPO. A future public offering  widely expected to be one of the most significant events in financial history  would serve as a major catalyst for the valuation of this holding. This entry into SpaceX complements Tonner Drones’ existing portfolio in the drone sector  which includes strategic positions in Elistair  Donecle and Diodon  alongside ongoing R&D into proprietary warehouse inventory management solutions.Diede van den Ouden  CEO of Tonner Drones  commented: ""After a year of stabilizing our foundation  2026 is about seizing the right opportunities. By reinvesting a small portion of our Donecle proceeds into an industry leader like SpaceX  we are diversifying our assets and aligning ourselves with the infrastructure that will shape the future of aerospace. This is a prudent first step in a broader strategy to create value for our shareholders as we continue to grow our own core activities.""End of Press-Release.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones develops technologies for the logistics sector.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).Performance and Portfolio ActivityDear Investors Volta Finance posted a net return of +0.3% for the final month of the year  taking the year-to-date performance to +2.7%. For comparison  US High Yield bonds returned +8.5%*** and Euro High Yield bonds achieved +5.2% over the same period  while the Morningstar Leveraged Loan indices were up +5.9%*** in the US and +4.1% in Europe.December markets were shaped by cautious central banks and mixed macro signals. In the US  the FED cut interest rates by 25bps as expected although it also reinforced its data-dependent stance  signaling patience on rate cuts as services inflation stayed sticky and labor markets cooled gradually. The ECB leaned dovish  highlighting weak growth and easing wage pressures. In the UK  while the Bank of England balanced slowing activity against still-elevated core inflation  one more cut in interest rates was voted and lowered rates from 4% to 3.75%. In Japan  the BOJ continued incremental normalization amid fragile consumption. Globally  softer PMIs contrasted with resilient consumption  while China’s targeted stimulus supported stabilization. Bond yields drifted lower  equities were range-bound  and currencies reflected relative policy divergence.Turning to loans  the Morningstar LSTA Leveraged Loan Indices recorded returns of +0.65% in the US*** and +0.48% in Europe  broadly in line with the performance of November. Pricewise  Euro Loans closed around 20 cent up while US Loans were flat through the month. Looking at the CLO markets  a heavy end of year pipeline impacted Non-Investment Grade & Equity as those tranches continued to trade weaker amidst a lack of support and probably some investor fatigue after a busy year.Volta Finance flagged this as a buying opportunity and selectively picked up some risk. The Portfolio Managers added €6.0 million worth of new investments  leveraging both the new issue and the secondary markets in a bid to complement shorter duration profiles with longer duration ones. Single-B rated risk was purchased at a discount margin of +925bps (European CLOs)  a very attractive level especially considering the strong spread tightening momentum observed since early January. A BB-rated position was also added in the +585bps  offering a decent carry opportunity and a lower duration profile. The fund generated about €25 million in cashflow  which is about 19% of December’s NAV on an annualized basis.In terms of performance breakdown  Volta’s CLO Equity tranches returned -0.2%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +0.9% performance**.As of end of December 2025  Volta’s NAV* was €259.3m  i.e. €7.09 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.15% of Volta’s NAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The equivalent % proportions of Volta’s NAV as of 30 November and 30 September were 0.07% and 0.08%  respectively.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** These figures are presented in USD.

Following discussions and analysis  this compensation is estimated at over 20 million euros  although some implementation modalities still need to be finalized.

The validation of the law in Brazil  which confirms the reimbursement of compensation related to past curtailments  represents a significant step forward for Voltalia  while discussions are ongoing regarding the mechanisms applicable to future periods. At the same time  the deployment of the SPRING plan is progressing in line with our roadmap: we are simplifying our scope  clarifying our organization  and focusing our resources on the activities that create the most value.

Energy Sales and Services for third-party clients accounts for 54% and 46% of total turnover  respectively.Geographically  2025 turnover is distributed as follows: 67% in Europe  29% in Latin America  and 4% in the rest of the world.Turnover for the fourth quarter of 2025 totals 166.3 million euros  up +8% at constant exchange rates (+7% at current exchange rates). Growth of the Development and Construction segment for third‑party clients more than offset the impact of lower production due to curtailment in Brazil. Energy Sales declines -15% at constant exchange rates (-16% at current exchange rates)  while Services for third‑party clients increases +42% at constant exchange rates (+41% at current exchange rates) compared with 2024.ENERGY SALESOperational indicators 2025 2024 Var.

To be noted  the main commissioning occurred at the end of the year and will contribute in 2026.Fourth‑quarter 2025 production reaches 1.3 TWh  compared with 1.4 TWh in the fourth quarter of 2024  representing a -11% decline.Quarterly production analysis by country:Brazil: Production falls -17% due to a sharp increase in curtailment in Q4 2025 (up 2.3x to 389 GWh)  despite better solar and wind resource levelsFrance: Production decreases -4%  driven by a combination of (i) asset disposals in 20247 (La Faye plant)  (ii) the impact of the fire at the Cacao biomass plant in French Guiana (covered by an insurance policy) and (iii) less favorable solar resource compared with Q4 2024  partly offset by better wind conditionsRest of the world: Production grows by +16% notably thanks to new plants commissionedHelexia: Production continues to grow strongly (+20%) across all geographiesFourth‑quarter 2025 turnover from Energy Sales amounts to 78.5 million euros  down -15% at constant exchange rates (-16% at current exchange rates). The increase in capacity  combined with improved resource levels in Brazil  was not sufficient to offset the unfavorable effects of: (i) curtailment in Brazil  (ii) pricing impacts in France and Albania after benefiting from high price levels on initial 2024 production8  and (iii) the EUR/BRL exchange rate impact.SERVICES9In million euros 2025 2024 Var. at current exchange rates Var. at constant exchange rates Q4 2025 Q4 2024 Var. at current exchange rates Var. at constant exchange rates Turnover from Development  Construction 244.9 137.4 +78% +78% 83.3 58.2 +43% +43% Turnover from Operation and Maintenance 27.1 23.4 +15% +18% 4.5 3.9 +15% +18% Total Turnover from Services 272.0 160.8 +69% +70% 87.8 62.1 +41% +42%Turnover in 2025 from Services for third‑party clients amounts to 272.0 million euros  up +70% at constant exchange rates (+69% at current exchange rates).

Ongoing construction projects  particularly in Ireland and Spain  account for a combined capacity of around 900 MW.Turnover from the Operation & Maintenance segment for third‑party clients totals 4.5 million euros  up +18% at constant exchange rates (+15% at current exchange rates) compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. The capacity operated on behalf of third‑party clients reaches 8.7 GW (+34%)  driven by the full‑year impact of new contracts in France  Ireland  and Brazil.NEW ANNOUNCEMENTSIn Brazil: reflecting a law on the compensation of past curtailment linked to the reliability of the network10Voltalia welcomes the adoption in Brazil of Law No. 15.269 last November by President Lula  which reimburses a significant part of past compensation related to reliability curtailment (excluding curtailment related to the balance of supply and demand).The measure covers the period from September 1  2023 to November 24  2025 and  following discussions and analysis would represent more than 20 million euros for Voltalia (indexed to the IPCA)  with calculations made by the ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema Elétrico – Brazilian grid operator) and ANEEL (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica – electricity regulator in Brazil) according to terms that are still being finalized.The company is currently assessing the accounting treatment of these items  the impact of which is expected to materialize mainly in 2026 and 2027  while discussions continue with the authorities on mechanisms for future curtailment  including those related to the balance of supply and demand  to improve visibility and regulatory stability for the broader market.In Romania: divestment of development activities11Voltalia announces the launch of the process of divesting development activities in Romania.

The fourth quarter was particularly strong: we reported record total net sales of €9.7 billion  including the revenue recognized for two High NA systems. Our gross margin for Q4 was in line with our guidance at 52.2%.""In the last months  many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation  primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand. This is reflected in a marked step-up in their medium-term capacity plans and in our record order intake.""Therefore  we expect 2026 to be another growth year for ASML's business  largely driven by a significant increase in EUV sales and growth in our installed base business sales1. We continue to invest in people and footprint to support that growth in 2026 and beyond.""We expect first-quarter 2026 total net sales between €8.2 billion and €8.9 billion  with a gross margin between 51% and 53%. We expect R&D costs of around €1.2 billion and SG&A costs of around €0.3 billion. For the full year 2026  we expect total net sales to be between €34 billion and €39 billion  with a gross margin between 51% and 53% "" said ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Christophe Fouquet.Update dividend and share buyback programASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2025 of €7.50 per ordinary share  which is a 17% increase compared to 2024.
