54810,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://cointelegraph.com/news/21shares-first-jito-staked-solana-etp-europe,21Shares launches first Jito staked Solana ETP in Europe,21Shares has launched a Jito-staked Solana ETP in Europe  offering exchange-traded exposure to JitoSOL with staking rewards embedded  as liquid staking ETFs remain under review in the US.,21Shares has launched a Jito-staked Solana exchange-traded product in Europe  offering listed exposure to the SOL token with staking embedded.The 21Shares Jito Staked SOL ETP will trade under the ticker JSOL in US dollars and euros and is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris  making it the first Europe-listed ETP backed by JitoSOL  according to the company. The product holds JitoSOL directly and reflects staking rewards in its net asset value.Developed by the Jito Network  JitoSOL represents SOL (SOL) deposited into a liquid staking program on the Solana network  where staked tokens remain transferable rather than locked. Holding JitoSOL allows investors to earn staking yield through a liquid token  without directly delegating to validators or managing onchain staking operations.In a series of posts on X on Thursday  Jito said the product offers institutional investors regulated access to JitoSOL while capturing staking and MEV-related rewards.The protocol said its European launch builds on last year’s JitoSOL ETF filing from VanEck in the United States and reflects a broader effort to expand institutional access to its liquid staking infrastructure.21Shares is a Switzerland-based issuer with more than 55 crypto ETPs listed across European exchanges and about $8 billion in assets under management globally  according to the company. It launched its first physically backed crypto ETP in 2018.Since October  it has operated as a subsidiary of FalconX  while maintaining independent product and investment operations.Jito Network launched in 2021 and focuses on liquid staking and validator infrastructure on Solana. At the time of writing  its JitoSOL token had a market capitalization of about $1.67 billion  according to CoinGecko data.Related: Solana validator count drops 68% as node costs squeeze small operatorsSolana staking ETFs launch in US  but liquid staking still up for debateIn the US  regulators have approved several Solana staking ETFs  but liquid staking has yet to receive clearance.In July  the first Solana staking ETF listed in the country recorded $12 million in net inflows on its first day of trading. In October  Bitwise’s Solana staking ETF launched with more than $220 million in assets. The product provides exposure to Solana alongside staking-derived yield. That same month  Grayscale Investments launched a staking-enabled Solana spot ETF in the US.US regulators have approved multiple Solana staking ETFs  but continue to bar liquid staking products from the domestic market.In July  Jito Labs  along with asset managers VanEck and Bitwise  urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow liquid staking in Solana ETPs  arguing it could improve capital efficiency and reduce operational rebalancing.About a month later  VanEck filed for a US-listed ETF that would hold JitoSOL. At the time of writing  the ETF had not been approved.Lucas Bruder  CEO of Jito Labs  told Cointelegraph that the company expects JitoSOL-based products to receive approval in the US and is seeing growing interest from markets in Asia and the Middle East.“The path forward relies on continued education around digital assets  proof-of-stake mechanics  and Solana's infrastructure advantages ” Bruder said.Magazine: ‘If you want to be great  make enemies’: Solana economist Max Resnick,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.36,0.64,True,English,"['first Jito', 'Solana ETP', '21Shares', 'Europe', '21Shares Jito Staked SOL ETP', 'Solana economist Max Resnick', 'staking-enabled Solana spot ETF', 'several Solana staking ETFs', 'multiple Solana staking ETFs', 'Jito-staked Solana exchange-traded product', 'first Solana staking ETF', 'first Europe-listed ETP', 'onchain staking operations', 'Solana validator count', 'liquid staking program', 'net asset value', 'liquid staking products', 'liquid staking infrastructure', 'JitoSOL ETF filing', 'crypto ETP', 'first day', 'validator infrastructure', 'US-listed ETF', 'Solana network', 'Solana ETPs', 'investment operations', 'net inflows', 'asset managers', 'JitoSOL-based products', 'Jito Network', 'Jito Labs', 'infrastructure advantages', 'SOL token', 'liquid token', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'regulated access', 'European launch', 'last year', 'United States', 'broader effort', 'institutional access', 'Switzerland-based issuer', 'European exchanges', 'market capitalization', 'CoinGecko data', 'node costs', 'small operators', 'Grayscale Investments', 'domestic market', 'Exchange Commission', 'capital efficiency', 'operational rebalancing', 'growing interest', 'Middle East', 'continued education', 'stake mechanics', 'independent product', 'Holding JitoSOL', 'institutional investors', 'MEV-related rewards', 'staking-derived yield', 'Lucas Bruder', 'US dollars', 'US Securities', 'digital assets', 'US regulators', 'JitoSOL.', 'exposure', 'The', 'ticker', 'JSOL', 'euros', 'Paris', 'company', 'tokens', 'validators', 'series', 'posts', 'Thursday', 'protocol', 'VanEck', 'management', 'October', 'subsidiary', 'FalconX', 'time', 'writing', 'debate', 'clearance', 'July', 'country', 'trading', 'Bitwise', 'CEO', 'Cointelegraph', 'approval', 'markets', 'Asia', 'path', 'Magazine', 'enemies']",2026-01-29,2026-01-30,cointelegraph.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation and risks arising from unexpected regulatory or political changes such as changes in tax regulation and regulations on trade and tariffs  such as protectionist measures  especially in the United States; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The plan builds on nearly a decade of impact through the JDE Peet’s Common Grounds program  which has reached close to one million farmers since 2015.Laurent Sagarra  VP Engagement at JDE Peet’s  said: “Without nature there is no coffee. Nature-related risks are no longer distant threats – they are here  now  impacting coffee farmers and supply chains worldwide. Our Nature Transition Plan is both a clear roadmap  and a call to action for the coffee industry to work together with governments  NGOs and coffee farmers to bend the curve on biodiversity loss and secure the future of coffee. By protecting nature  we protect coffee  communities and the shared future of our industry.”Specific aims of JDE Peet’s Nature Transition Plan include:Deforestation-free: Drive collective sector action to address deforestation in coffee – going beyond EU Deforestation Regulation compliance and addressing both environmental and socio‑economic challenges.Climate resilience: Expanding adoption of regenerative coffee farming practices to an additional 200 000 hectares by 2030  improving soil  biodiversity and water outcomes.Responsibly sourced: Move towards 100% responsibly sourced green coffee by 2028 – building on the 83.2% achieved in 2024 – by sourcing green coffee under industry-recognized sustainability schemes (including those aligned with the Global Coffee Platform Equivalence Mechanism)  alongside strengthened supplier capacity  compliance support and Common Grounds sourcing principles.The full Nature Transition Plan is available here.# # #Notes to editorsThe Nature Transition Plan follows JDE Peet’s ‘Assess  Address  Progress’ framework: Assess: Rigorous supply chain mapping and risk analysis across all coffee growing archetypes.Address: Targeted farmer programs delivering regenerative practices  climate smart training and compliance support. Progress: Transparent measurement  reporting and scaling of proven solutions.JDE Peet’s identifies three production archetypes to tailor its nature-related mitigation strategies: Brazil & Vietnam: High-yield systems characterized by high mechanization  irrigation and high input use. Latin America: Medium-yield systems featuring shade-grown  rain-fed coffee and wet milling. East Africa & Indonesia: Low-yield systems characterized by shade-grown  rain-fed coffee and low mechanization.JDE Peet’s sources approximately 8% of the world’s green coffee. As of 2024  JDE Peet's has achieved 100% responsibly sourced green coffee in several major markets  including Europe  the United States and Australia/New Zealand. Globally  the company reached 83.2% responsibly sourced green coffee in 2024.The Common Grounds program has reached close to 1 million farmers in 29 countries since 2015. Key pillars of the program are: Responsible Sourcing – regenerative agriculture  farmer livelihoods  ethical supply chains. Minimising Footprint – reducing emissions  waste and resource use Connecting People – promoting diversity  equity  inclusion and community engagement.# # #EnquiriesMediaMoustapha Echahbouni+31 6 2139 1762Media@JDEPeets.comInvestors & AnalystsRobin Jansen+31 6 1594 4569IR@JDEPeets.comAbout JDE Peet’sJDE Peet’s is the world’s leading pure-play coffee company  serving approximately 4 400 cups of coffee per second in more than 100 markets.

These indications were chosen based on strong  IL-7R-driven biology and are fully aligned with the Company’s 2026–2028 strategic plan to expand lusvertikimab into targeted  high value immune-mediated diseases. Development of one or both indications will proceed subject to financing  with the first Phase 2 clinical trial planned to initiate in H2 2026.A Science-Led Selection of Two High-Value Indications with Significant Unmet Medical NeedChronic pouchitis and HS both exhibit robust translational alignment with IL-7R biology  including T cell-driven inflammation and dysregulation of IL-7/IL-7R pathway and overexpression in diseased tissues.This mechanism mirrors ulcerative colitis  where lusvertikimab has demonstrated statistically significant Phase 2 efficacy and favorable safety profile. Together  the data support lusvertikimab’s potential as a differentiated immunology platform across multiple immune-driven diseases.Marc Le Bozec  Chief Executive Officer of OSE Immunotherapeutics commented: “We selected pouchitis and hidradenitis suppurativa because both indications present compelling scientific rationale for lusvertikimab  which could become the first-in-class IL-7R antagonist to reach the market. Pouchitis is a natural extension of our ulcerative colitis work and  due to its well-defined population  represents a rare-disease opportunity we can advance independently at a reasonable cost. HS  by contrast  is a much larger dermatology indication where we can move quickly toward a proof-of-concept readout with a highly differentiated asset. Our goal is to initiate a first Phase 2 study in the second half of 2026  subject to financing. Together  these indications reinforce our strategy and strengthen the long-term potential of lusvertikimab as a differentiated immunology platform with multi-billion peak sales potential.”Chronic Pouchitis: Rare  High-Need and Capital-EfficientApproximately 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis are refractory to available therapies and require proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)  an artificial rectum surgically created1. Approximately 70% of these patients undergoing surgery will develop pouchitis.3 Pouchitis is an inflammatory condition of the ileal pouch. Symptoms include increased stool frequency  urgency  and abdominal discomfort  significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Traditionally the mainstay treatment of acute pouchitis involves the use of antibiotics  but approximately 15% of patients  or an estimated 45 000 patients across the European Union  North America and Japan 2 3  develop chronic pouchitis  which poses significant challenges in terms of management and is an area of significant unmet medical need (only one EMA-approved therapy to date and no FDA-approved options). With a clearly identifiable population  pathogenetic continuity with ulcerative colitis  and limited competition  chronic pouchitis is a high-value  capital-efficient opportunity for OSE to pursue independently.Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Large Dermatological Indication with Fast Proof-of-Concept PotentialHS is an inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent suppurative and painful nodules  abscesses and draining sinus tracts primarily in intertriginous areas of the skin. While not a rare disease  affecting approximately 1% of the general population4 or an estimated 9.5M individuals across Europe  North America and Japan2  HS is a condition rarely talked about  with patients waiting an average of up to 10 years to receive a proper diagnosis. HS is associated with tremendous impact on quality of life: visible skin lesions associated with intense pain  an unpleasant smell and scarring can cause patients to experience social stigma and depression. An estimated 0.5-0.6M moderate-to-severe patients may be eligible for biologic therapy.2 5Despite several approved biologics  many patients remain inadequately controlled over the long term. HS shows intense Th1/Th17 activation and increased IL-7R expression  offering a strong biological rationale for IL-7R blockade. The indication enables rapid clinical readouts  supporting a fast  data-driven proof-of-concept strategy in a large  high-value immune-dermatology market.Next Steps and Timelines:First Phase 2 study initiation: H2 2026 (either Chronic pouchitis or HS)  subject to financing.H2 2026 (either Chronic pouchitis or HS)  subject to financing. Second Phase 2 study initiation: H1 2027  contingent on financing.These studies complement the subcutaneous Ulcerative Colitis program  support a balanced late-stage diversification strategy across near-term rare disease and mid-term dermatology  and enhance partnering optionality by demonstrating the breadth and therapeutic relevance of IL-7R biology. Both studies are designed to be capital-efficient and to deliver clear evidence of differentiated clinical efficacy and safety.In parallel of developing these two new indications  OSE will advance the Ulcerative Colitis indication through developing a subcutaneous formulation of lusvertikimab and aims to partner this asset once bioequivalence data have been generated. Additional scientific evidence will be generated to further validate the biomarker signature potentially predictive of a strong clinical response identified in the Lusvertikimab Phase 2 CoTikiS study. Confirming these early findings with a subcutaneous formulation would position Lusvertikimab in Ulcerative Colitis as a game changer in the treatment of this disease  and significantly enhance the attractiveness of this asset for potential partners.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICSOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

By swapping SOL for JitoSOL  investors retain full exposure to the price of Solana while automatically earning two sources of yield: standard staking rewards and an additional share of incremental revenue from transaction fees and prioritization mechanisms on the Solana network. The result is full SOL price exposure with an integrated yield component and no operational complexity.“The 21shares JSOL ETP is designed to give investors access to one of the most recognised Solana liquid staked tokens through their existing brokers ” said Alistair Byas-Perry  VP  Head of EU Investments and Capital Markets at 21shares. “JitoSOL is an efficient way to stake SOL  maximising yield while ensuring liquidity for institutional players. 21shares was the first issuer in the world to introduce staking on its Solana ETP (ASOL) in 2021. To this date  ASOL remains the largest Solana ETP globally. By launching the world’s first JitoSOL ETP  21shares is once again innovating in the space  offering investors solutions to participate fully in the Solana ecosystem's growth.”""JitoSOL was built from the ground up to provide liquidity and full staking exposure without compromising on transparency or network alignment ” said Brian Smith  President of the Jito Foundation. “As Solana continues to build Internet capital markets and become mature  global financial infrastructure  products like the 21shares Jito Staked SOL ETP help open the door for European investors to participate in Solana's long-term growth and economic activity in a responsible  regulated way. 21shares is a trailblazer in bringing crypto investment vehicles to the European market  and we're thrilled to be working with them.""Solana has emerged as one of the few blockchain networks where real-world economic activity operates at scale.

The shadow cast by the two major tragedies that occurred back to back in recent days continues to weigh heavily on society. And while in the case of Romania it is more likely that we are dealing with human error  in the case of “Violanta” in Trikala there is  of course  responsibility. Before we move on to angry outbursts against individuals and institutions  it would be wise to wait a bit. After all  to be fair  the Fire Service did its job very quickly and within 48 hours revealed what had happened. Whether only the company is responsible—because from the findings it is clear that it bears responsibility  given that corroded propane pipes were found that caused the explosion—whether the underground facilities were illegal or poorly maintained  and whether the fire-safety plans it had submitted for the factory were deficient  we do not yet know. Justice will determine that. It simply becomes ridiculous once again—and disrespectful at this moment—for opposition politics to be played on this issue as well. I would say that it could be considered just as disrespectful for the government to try to prove that the country’s statistics on workplace accidents are very low—we are third from the bottom in workplace accidents in the EU  there’s a nice… backwater for you—but obviously when Karystianou comes out and engages in “grave-robbing” over the tragic accident  in order to return to the (for her) favorable spotlight  enough is enough. That is why the spokesperson Marinakis spoke with such intensity on the issue yesterday (on SKAI)  reminding everyone of what the opposition was saying around this time last year about xylene in Tempi.The exercise with ships and trucksI’m moving on to other matters  to take you to yesterday’s meeting held at the Maximos Mansion on traffic congestion  where many interesting things were discussed  with the main focus on efforts to limit truck traffic  which accounts for 20% of morning traffic on Kifissos Avenue. Obviously  when the logistics hub moves from Elaionas to Fyli  there will be some relief  while the government is also considering reopening Kaza  that is  the old National Road. However  a total ban on trucks did not gain traction as an idea  since in an informal consultation conducted by Minister Theodorikakos with the Chambers there were significant reactions. Still  K.M. asked Kikilias to explore with shipowners the scenario of some cargo ships arriving earlier at Piraeus and unloading at 5:30 a.m. instead of 6:30  to provide some breathing room. In addition  a proposal for smart traffic lights will be discussed  as was done in Thessaloniki  since the contractor declared readiness to apply in the Attica Basin the system that relieved central arteries of the co-capital.Open the doors (let Kouroumplis in too)Look  today I have very pleasant news for you from PASOK: we are one step away from the damned needle finally unsticking and the Movement growing wings again  as the late Simitis once said after a reshuffle when he sacked Pachtas. Our leader Nikos tried and tried with his “values code” and “institutional moves” and has now properly begun opening up to all the cadres who left the party after the first memorandum and went mainly to SYRIZA  but also elsewhere. I hear that Nina Kasimati may well come into PASOK’s welcoming green arms (and why not Nina Lotsari too!)  having even attended an event by Giannis Sgouros  while I’m told that Panagiotis Kouroumplis—who lately had been spotted in Kasselakis’s party—is also positive  under conditions  to our president’s invitation. They just shouldn’t forget Bistis  because I hear the man is on a departure trajectory from the New Left.Olga is still fuming…A source told me that meanwhile Olga  who is on a ministerial trip to India  has not yet cooled down and is cursing gods and demons—or rather the Maximos Mansion—because  as she says  “they’re not covering her.” I learn that she was told officially (not by the Maximos Mansion  mind you): look  either sort out your personal matters with your ex-husband and be done with it  or go home and do whatever you want… kill each other freely  or something along those lines; in any case  she was sent a message that they won’t be dealing with her much longer. I’m waiting to see the next episode  which is expected to be filmed at the court hearing of the case in a few days.The agreement with the FrenchBeyond the stroll at the Salamis Naval Base and the tour of the Kimon  today’s arrival of the French Minister of the Armed Forces  Karin Vautrin  and her meetings with both Nikos Dendias and K.M. are of particular importance  as talks are underway with the French on renewing the defense cooperation agreement that Mitsotakis signed with Macron a few years ago in Paris  when we ordered the first Belharra. The negotiation will not be simple and will take time  but I understand that the intention on both sides is to move toward renewal. Specifically  the French defense minister will be welcomed by Nikos Dendias at the Salamis Naval Base (at 10:30 a.m.)  followed by a meeting aboard the frigate Kimon. Immediately afterward  Karin Vautrin will head to the Salamis Shipyards  which have undertaken the construction of metal blocks for the FDI frigates  having expanded their cooperation with Naval Group. It is no coincidence that at the shipyards—besides the president  Giorgos Koros—the president and CEO of Naval Group himself  Pierre-Éric Pommellet  will also be present. Let us recall that the French of Naval Group have  as is well known  submitted a proposal to include Greece in the FDI frigate program with the sale of three more—built at the Skaramangas shipyards—with a production line and cooperation with Greek companies. This is being examined as a proposal. After all this  Catherine Vautrin will go to the Maximos Mansion to meet the Prime Minister.The… upgradeThe big issue for the Stock Exchange is whether it will be upgraded to developed market status by MSCI this coming August; however  developments may come earlier  from STOXX. Specifically  in April  STOXX—controlled by Deutsche Bank—may announce its decision on the status of the Athens Exchange  as the Greek market is already on the Watch List. A little earlier  on March 31  MSCI will announce  as part of its Annual Market Classification Review  whether Greece will be upgraded to Developed Market status (unless MSCI itself officially shifts the date). If MSCI’s decision is positive  Greece’s reclassification as a developed market is expected to take effect after the market close on August 31  2026. Subsequently  on September 21  2026  the corresponding reclassification by the FTSE index is expected to take effect.OPAP stays  PPC a question markNow  in contrast to JP Morgan  Morgan Stanley keeps OPAP among the five MSCI Greece stocks after the upgrade  while it describes the inclusion of PPC as “possible” and removes Jumbo and OTE shares from the list. The lion’s share of inflows from an upgrade will go to banking stocks  especially National Bank  with total positive inflows of $287 million  compared with $233 million for Eurobank  $208 million for Piraeus Bank  and $196 million for Alpha  while OPAP is expected to see net inflows of $121 million. In any case  Morgan Stanley also points out that after the upgrade the Athens Exchange will be a small fish in a big lake: MSCI Greece is estimated to have a weight of 0.06% in the MSCI World index  whereas its current weight in the MSCI Emerging Markets index stands at 0.57%.The “tricks” in Chinese yards to conceal the shadow fleetThe game with shadow-fleet vessels is getting very serious.There are certain incidents which  no matter how “technical” they may sound  ring extremely loud alarm bells. The recent episode at a Chinese yard  involving a sanctioned tanker that “borrowed” the identity of a newbuild that has not yet… even touched the water  clearly falls into this category. For the first time  we are seeing identity theft of a vessel that is still under construction. Not a scrapped ship  not a “zombie” IMO recycled from old paperwork  but the IMO number of a tanker that is being legitimately built at a Chinese shipyard. And this is precisely where concern begins — not theoretical  but entirely practical. When a sanctioned vessel is sailing through the Straits of Singapore  carrying Russian or Iranian oil  and appears in systems as a “newbuild from China ” the problem does not concern only the dark side of the shadow fleet. It concerns the shipping ecosystem itself. Because if the IMO number — the ship’s absolute “tax ID” — can be used prematurely  before a newbuild is even delivered  then a dangerous grey zone opens up. Today it is one sanctioned Aframax. Tomorrow  who can guarantee that an ordinary shipowner  a shipyard  a bank or a classification society will not become unintentionally entangled  simply because they are looking at “clean” paperwork? Who monitors what happens around newbuildings before they are even delivered? And who will be exposed if such practices become widespread? China has every reason to protect the reputation of its shipyards. Europe and the United States are pressing for safety and transparency. And Greek shipping  which has invested billions in Chinese yards  has absolutely no margin to find itself “by accident” in the same frame as the shadow fleet. This incident is not merely another inventive sanctions-evasion trick. It is a warning. And those in Athens  Piraeus or the major shipping offices who read it as a “distant problem” may soon be forced to see it much closer than they would like.Marios Iliopoulos: On capitalism  shipping ministers  values  seamanship  etc.From his very first sentence  Marios Iliopoulos set the tone of his speech during the event for the cutting of the New Year’s cake of the Panhellenic Seamen’s Federation: a capitalist  but with limits. Speaking at a sectoral event  the owner of Seajets stressed that entrepreneurship without values leads to conflict and the loss of common sense. Criticism of the political scene was not absent. He thanked the current Minister of Shipping and Island Policy for attending the event  but did not spare the previous leadership of the ministry  which he described as the worst in coastal shipping and maritime affairs since 1985. His message was clear: the state  shipowners and trade unions must cooperate harmoniously for the sector to function. The central figures were Greek seafarers. Iliopoulos spoke about seamanship. At Seajets  he emphasized  the relationship of trust and cohesion with seafarers resembles a family  and this relationship is what keeps him in the sector despite his other business activities. He underlined the importance of balance between shipowners  seafarers and trade unionism  and warned that the dominance of extreme approaches harms the sector as a whole. In closing  he sent a message against division  placing emphasis on maritime education and the attraction of young seafarers  calling for respect for values  cohesion and pride  so that Greek shipping remains a protagonist in the economy.Shipping looks aheadIn shipping we often hear words about innovation  digital transformation and the green transition. Theory is turning into practice through initiatives such as the Memorandum of Cooperation between the University of Nicosia / UNIC Athens and Laskaridis Shipping Co. Ltd. of Panos Laskaridis  which will be signed this afternoon in Athens  in the presence of Cyprus’s Deputy Minister of Shipping  Marina Hadjimanolis. The agreement touches the core of shipping’s real challenges — namely  how artificial intelligence and big-data analytics can become tools of everyday operational efficiency rather than theoretical concepts discussed at conferences. The interesting element is that the agreement is not limited to the environmental footprint  even though emissions  fuels and decarbonization targets are at the forefront. It goes one step further: predictive maintenance  route optimization  decision-support systems — in other words  all those things shipping companies know they need but often struggle to implement in practice. In the background  the provision for utilizing automated operational data and for creating an AI Hub for shipping carries its own significance. It shows that the discussion is shifting from “what regulations require” to “how real expertise is built ” with universities and shipping companies speaking the same language. At a time when shipping is under pressure from regulatory frameworks  costs and geopolitical uncertainty  such collaborations send the message that those who invest in knowledge will have a say tomorrow.Tuition fee increasesShould I say it came as a surprise? I wouldn’t be honest  because this is more or less how we all imagined it — even though at the beginning they were selling some… nonsense that the goal was not tuition increases but expanding each school’s capacity  meaning the number of students  the services offered  and similar things. The reference is to the wave of acquisitions of private schools we have seen  to the point that there is virtually no private school left that could be sold while remaining in the hands of its old owners. As a reader informs the column by name  “recently the Erasmeios Greek-German School proceeded with an excessive increase in tuition fees  a fact that has provoked strong reactions from dozens of parents.”The 11+1 milestones achieved at the Stock ExchangeThe Athens Avenue has quite a few allies on its side  helping it conquer new peaks continuously. Some stocks renewed their records  while certain new protagonists also emerged. Three of the four systemic banks extended their multi-year highs  with the exception of National Bank  which corrected in a controlled manner. Eurobank climbed above €4.3  a 10-year high  having received a vote of confidence from BofA  which named it a top pick in Greece while simultaneously raising its target price to €5.64. Alpha Bank came within one “step” of €4.2  its highest level since November 2015. Piraeus Bank extended its 5-year record  reaching the fringes of €8.8. PPC is heading full speed toward €20  a price it last saw about 18 years ago  specifically in July 2008. GEK TERNA reached €33 and has entered the final stretch to “break” its record high of €33.67 (November 1999). At the same time  Motor Oil is very close to €34 for the first time. Aegean “took off” above €15  stopping at €15.1  which constitutes a new all-time high. Among the winners was also the Viohalco group  with the parent company’s share breaking the €13 “barrier.” Cenergy approached €19 and ElvalHalcor closed at €4.65  a new 18.5-year high. The psychological €21 level was surpassed for the first time by Kri Kri. Finally  the performance of Austriacard is particularly impressive  as yesterday it recorded a jump of over 9% and reached €7 — a price it had not seen since September 2023. This is the same stock that just three months ago was trading below €5  at historic lows.Greek-American eye on real estateQuite a few companies were established in recent days  most of them focusing on real estate  which obviously promises significant capital gains. Among them  I single out “Mas Ono Single-Member P.C. ” which was incorporated last Friday  January 16  with the explicit purpose of buying and selling and managing real estate  trading time-share properties  leasing services and the provision of rooms or accommodation units for visitors  among other activities. What struck me was the initial share capital  amounting to €14 000 000  divided into 14 000 000 corporate shares of capital contributions with a nominal value of €1 each  fully paid up upon incorporation. The sole shareholder — having contributed the €14 million — is the American company “Mas Ono LLC ” based in Stockton  USA  represented at incorporation by lawyer Orestis Omran-Koukouvitakis. Management and representation of Mas Ono IKE were assigned for an indefinite period to Ioannis Liveris. This is the well-known Giannos Liveris in the Greek market  a collaborator of shipowner G. Oikonomou  who has appeared from time to time in various energy companies and until 1999 served as a senior advisor to Socrates Kokkalis at Intracom. The real estate company is said to belong to the Greek-American Spanou family.Rumors about Real ConsultingThe share of technology company Real Consulting  which trades at €6.28 with a market capitalization of €133.3 million  has recorded a rise of +21.7% over one month. The surge from €5.16 at the end of December to current levels is not due solely to the business initiatives of Nikos Vardinogiannis  who controls 50.85% of the share capital. Real Consulting has just completed the acquisition of Smart UX in Romania and increased its stake to 97% in January. The goal of the acquisition is penetration into the utilities sector of Southeast Europe. Eurobank Equities had set a target price of €6.20 for the share  a level that Real Consulting has already exceeded  while trading volumes are particularly elevated. Rumors are circulating in the market that there is an agreement with a strong shipping group that will introduce part of its activities into the listed company. What can I say? These are rumors  but I don’t quite understand why a powerful shipowner would introduce part of his activities through Real Consulting instead of doing so directly  in order to reap all the capital gains himself. This particular rumor strongly recalls the Athens Stock Exchange of 1999 — yet  one way or another  the share keeps rising. Market sources  however  speak of discussions and processes that are under way  with all scenarios open  even that of a merger.CyberattackThe Hellenic Capital Market Commission  together with cybersecurity specialists  is investigating the attack recently suffered by Euroxx. The brokerage firm itself announced the cyberattack  stating that there is no indication of damage or data leakage. For security reasons  the investment firm proceeded with a temporary  preventive suspension of certain systems  and restoration is being carried out gradually.A difficult mission: Euronext struggles to attract shipping companies to the ASEThe assumption of management of ATHEX by Euronext brings dramatic content changes to the Athens Stock Exchange. Greek shipowners  who control 20% of the global fleet  are financed by Greek banking systems but list their shares and tradable bonds everywhere except Athens. With €14.5 billion in shipping loans on their books  Greek banks see a significant opportunity. The upgrade of Euronext’s infrastructure — electronic trading  liquidity  international visibility — could turn Athens into a credible venue for shipping IPOs as well as for the trading of shipping bond issues. To date  Greek shipowners show a preference for Oslo  London and New York for reasons of confidentiality  tax certainty and  above all  market size  as the investor base is far larger. Athens is trying to offer something Greek shipping companies do not currently have: proximity and co-location with Greek banking financing  absolute knowledge of the sector and — most importantly — guarantees that the Greek tax system will not suddenly “discover” new obligations. So far  however  these efforts do not seem to be yielding results.The euro–dollar relationship determines the stock-market gameMarkets have fully grasped the plan of the Trump administration  which is attempting to address the debt  deficit and competitiveness problems of the U.S. economy through a controlled depreciation of the dollar. It already takes $1.2 to buy €1  and technical analysts are searching for the next support and resistance levels. The older “gurus” of Wall Street are digging into their memories to recall what happened during the two largest periods of coordinated dollar weakening over the past 50 years. After the abolition of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971  the S&P 500 gained just +5% over six years in nominal terms. Over the same period  Germany’s DAX soared +160% and Japan’s Nikkei +450%. Ten years later  after the Plaza Accord in 1985  a similar dynamic emerged: the S&P +54% over five years  the DAX +80%  the Nikkei +130%. Today things are different. Non-U.S. investors now hold nearly $20 trillion in U.S. equities — five times the amount in 2008. Of these  according to Morgan Stanley  more than 50% of European positions are not hedged against currency risk. As the “weak dollar” policy unfolds  Europeans will need to cover their currency exposure with FX hedge contracts. In practice  this means selling dollars. Given the scale of these capital flows  we are talking about structural pressure. But if  instead of hedging  they choose to dump large positions in U.S. equities to avoid currency losses  then the game changes. Trump’s plan is based on abundant available liquidity  which will grow even further once interest-rate cuts begin. The question is whether the ever-increasing liquidity will choose American assets — or change direction.,negative,0.04,0.2,0.76,mixed,0.25,0.12,0.63,True,English,"['open arms', 'kind reminder', 'tuition fees', 'private schools', 'Chinese yard', 'shadow fleet', 'limits', 'tragedy', 'PASOK', 'Kouroumplis', 'Olga', 'two major tragedies', 'corroded propane pipes', 'many interesting things', 'old National Road', 'welcoming green arms', 'Salamis Naval Base', 'smart traffic lights', 'defense cooperation agreement', 'French defense minister', 'Minister Theodorikakos', 'traffic congestion', 'truck traffic', 'morning traffic', 'French Minister', 'human error', 'angry outbursts', 'Fire Service', 'underground facilities', 'fire-safety plans', 'workplace accidents', 'tragic accident', 'favorable spotlight', 'spokesperson Marinakis', 'other matters', 'Maximos Mansion', 'main focus', 'Kifissos Avenue', 'logistics hub', 'total ban', 'informal consultation', 'significant reactions', 'K.M.', 'breathing room', 'Attica Basin', 'central arteries', 'pleasant news', 'damned needle', 'late Simitis', 'leader Nikos', 'values code', 'institutional moves', 'first memorandum', 'Nina Kasimati', 'Nina Lotsari', 'Giannis Sgouros', 'departure trajectory', 'New Left', 'ministerial trip', 'personal matters', 'next episode', 'court hearing', 'Armed Forces', 'Karin Vautrin', 'Nikos Dendias', 'particular importance', 'first Belharra', 'recent days', 'opposition politics', 'cargo ships', 'Panagiotis Kouroumplis', 'Newsroom', 'Greetings', 'shadow', 'society', 'case', 'Romania', 'Violanta', 'Trikala', 'responsibility', 'individuals', 'institutions', 'job', '48 hours', 'company', 'findings', 'explosion', 'factory', 'Justice', 'moment', 'issue', 'government', 'country', 'statistics', 'bottom', 'EU', 'backwater', 'Karystianou', 'grave', 'order', 'intensity', 'SKAI', 'everyone', 'time', 'xylene', 'Tempi', 'exercise', 'trucks', 'yesterday', 'meeting', 'efforts', 'Elaionas', 'Fyli', 'relief', 'Kaza', 'traction', 'idea', 'Chambers', 'Kikilias', 'shipowners', 'scenario', '5:30 a', 'addition', 'proposal', 'Thessaloniki', 'contractor', 'readiness', 'system', 'capital', 'doors', 'PASOK', 'Movement', 'wings', 'reshuffle', 'Pachtas', 'cadres', 'party', 'SYRIZA', 'event', 'Kasselakis', 'conditions', 'president', 'invitation', 'Bistis', 'Olga', 'source', 'India', 'gods', 'demons', 'husband', 'something', 'lines', 'message', 'stroll', 'tour', 'Kimon', 'arrival', 'talks', 'Mitsotakis', 'Macron', 'Paris', 'negotiation', 'intention', 'sides', 'renewal', '10:30']",2026-01-29,2026-01-30,en.protothema.gr
