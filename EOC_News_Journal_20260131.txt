(HDS/EAS) have today signed the key founding documents for the establishment of a joint venture focused on the production of large-calibre ammunition in Greece. The newly created joint ventur…,CSG and the Greek state-owned company Hellenic Defence Systems S.A. (HDS/EAS) have today signed the key founding documents for the establishment of a joint venture focused on the production of large-calibre ammunition in Greece. The newly created joint venture  Hellenic Ammunition S.A.  represents a major step in restoring strategic production capacities in Lavrio while further strengthening CSG’s vertical integration in ammunition manufacturing.The documents were signed today in Athens by Jiří Schönweitz  Managing Director of MSM Greece  and Christoforos Boutsikakis  Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hellenic Defence Systems. The signed agreements include in particular the Articles of Association and a concession agreement  enabling the formal establishment of Hellenic Ammunition S.A.“Today’s signing marks a key milestone not only for our joint project with HDS  but also for strengthening Europe’s defence industrial base. Lavrio is becoming an important pillar of ammunition production for Greece  Europe and its allies ” said Jiří Schönweitz  Managing Director of MSM Greece. “We would like to thank everyone involved in making this venture possible  with special thanks to Hellenic Defence Systems for their trust  as well as to the Greek government and the relevant ministries for their forward-looking approach and recognition of the project’s potential. We are confident that  in the future  all those involved will look back with pride on this important step  which will help place the Greek defence manufacturing industry back on the world map where it belongs ” Mr. Schönweitz added.“The restoration of large-calibre ammunition production in Lavrio is a strategic step for the Greek defence industry and for Europe’s security. The joint venture with CSG brings investment  modern technologies and know-how that will enable sustainable long-term development of capacities and the creation of hundreds of jobs ” added Christoforos Boutsikakis  CEO of Hellenic Defence Systems.Under the signed agreements  MSM will obtain managerial control over the Lavrio production site for a period of 25 years  allowing for the implementation of an extensive investment and modernisation programme. Approximately 120 employees currently work at the Lavrio facility. The company plans to recruit an additional 180 employees this year  with total employment expected to reach around 300 by the end of the year.Large-calibre ammunition production will operate in a multi-shift regime in 2026. The plant is already producing 155 mm ammunition  with further calibres planned to be introduced over the course of the year. A significant technological milestone will be the launch of production of so-called base bleed grain (composite propellant)  scheduled for the second half of this year.The project also includes the restoration of TNT production in Lavrio. Explosives production in Europe has long been constrained due to historical outsourcing of energy-intensive processes outside the region.

Production is scheduled to begin at the turn of 2026 and 2027. Overall investments in Lavrio amount to several tens of millions of euros  with CSG having committed to investing up to €50 million into the joint venture over the long term.About CSGCSG N.V.

In this context  our full-year results were mixed. Our Professional business grew in the US but declined in Europe. Our Consumer business delivered sustained growth in all regions except China. Connected lighting showed strong growth in both Professional and Consumer markets  but this was offset by a decline in non-connected  particularly in trade channels. Both businesses maintained a strong gross margin. OEM faced reduced demand and pricing pressure. Adjusted EBITA was 8.9%  and we generated strong cash flow of EUR 440 million  or 7.6% of sales.In the fourth quarter  continued connected growth and a strong topline performance in the US and India was offset by declines in a number of other regions. The adjusted EBITA margin for the quarter was impacted by a lower contribution from Consumer  OEM and Conventional."" said As Tempelman  CEO of Signify.“Through what will be a transitional year for Signify  our immediate priority is to outperform in a tough market by strengthening our commercial and operational excellence  and cost competitiveness. To drive this  we are announcing a EUR 180 million program to structurally reset our cost base  which will unfortunately impact 900 roles across Signify. To focus the business for future success  we are conducting a full strategy and portfolio review and will share our conclusions at our Capital Markets Day on June 23  2026.We anticipate the challenging conditions to persist through 2026. Considering the diverging dynamics in our end markets  we are not providing guidance on full-year sales at this stage. We expect an adjusted EBITA margin of 7.5-8.5%  and free cash flow generation of 6.5-7.5% of sales. We intend to pay an increased dividend of EUR 1.57 per share  while pausing share buybacks for capital reduction purposes  to preserve financial flexibility during our strategic review.I want to thank our employees for their commitment and resilience throughout the year. Their dedication is essential as we position Signify for sustainable  profitable growth.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025Having completed its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program  Signify will introduce its new sustainability program in the first quarter of 2026.

54835,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/30/3229451/0/en/Press-Release-Sanofi-s-Rezurock-recommended-for-EU-approval-by-the-CHMP-to-treat-chronic-graft-vs-host-disease.html,Press Release: Sanofi’s Rezurock recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat chronic graft-vs-host disease,Sanofi’s Rezurock recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat chronic graft-vs-host disease  Recommendation supported by safety and efficacy results...,Sanofi’s Rezurock recommended for EU approval by the CHMP to treat chronic graft-vs-host diseaseRecommendation supported by safety and efficacy results from several clinical studies and real-world evidenceIf approved  Rezurock would offer a new treatment option in the EU for adult patients and in children aged 12 years and older in late line chronic GVHDParis  January 30  2026. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorisation of Rezurock (belumosudil) in the EU for the treatment of adults and in children aged 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg  with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The medicine is to be used when other treatment options provide limited clinical benefit  are not suitable  or have been exhausted. This positive recommendation comes after Sanofi requested a re-examination of the prior negative opinion adopted by the CHMP in October 2025. The final European Commission decision is expected in the coming weeks.“Chronic GVHD can involve multiple organs and profoundly affect patients’ daily lives  limiting everyday activities and taking a substantial emotional toll ” said Prof Mohamad Mohty  Professor of Haematology  Head of the Haematology and Cellular Therapy Department at Hôpital Saint-Antoine and Sorbonne University  Paris  France. “For patients who have exhausted available treatment options  this positive opinion marks an important step forward in our ability to better manage this challenging disease.”“We sought a re-examination of the CHMP opinion  and made the commitment to conduct a new post-approval confirmatory study  given the limited late-line treatment options available for EU patients living with chronic GVHD and the body of Rezurock clinical evidence generated including data from patients in Europe ” said Olivier Charmeil  Executive Vice President  General Medicines  Sanofi. “We remain committed to supporting the GVHD community and welcome this positive CHMP opinion  which brings us closer to delivering a new approved treatment in the EU for adult and adolescent GVHD patients who are waiting.”This CHMP recommendation is based on safety and efficacy results from several clinical studies and real-world evidence. This includes the randomised  multicentre ROCKstar phase 2 study  which demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses with Rezurock for patients living with chronic GVHD after stem cell transplant and at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Under the CHMP positive opinion for conditional marketing authorisation  Sanofi will also conduct a confirmatory randomised controlled study.Rezurock is approved in 20 countries  including the US  UK  and Canada for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy and in China after failure of one prior line of systemic therapy.More than 17 000 patients living with chronic GVHD have been treated with Rezurock in approved countries since its first approval in the US in July 2021.About RezurockRezurock (belumosudil) is Sanofi's first-in-class selective ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2) inhibitor (ROCK2i). It has been shown to help many different types of people with chronic GVHD after failure of any two other types of treatment.Sanofi is committed to investigating the safety and efficacy of Rezurock in other age groups and indications  including through ongoing studies for paediatric patients with chronic GVHD from one year old who have been treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy and for patients with chronic lung allograft dysfunction. These additional indications are currently under investigation and have not been approved by regulatory authorities.About the ROCKstar studyROCKstar was a pivotal phase 2  open label  non-controlled  randomised  multicentre study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Rezurock in patients with chronic GVHD after receiving 2 to 5 prior lines of systemic therapy. A 3-year  open-label  follow-up analysis of the ROCKstar study evaluated the long-term efficacy of Rezurock.Treatment consisted of Rezurock 200 mg and was administered continuously until clinically significant progression of chronic GvHD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was best overall response rate (ORR) at any time.Study results demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant best ORR of 74% on treatment with Rezurock (n=77  95% CI  63-83). The most common adverse reactions were fatigue (46%)  diarrhoea (35%)  nausea (35%)  dyspnoea (32%)  cough (30%) and upper respiratory tract infections (26%).About chronic graft-versus-host diseaseGVHD is a life-threatening complication that can occur following stem cell transplant (or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant) where the donor’s (graft) cells attack the host’s cells  leading to inflammation and fibrosis (scarring or thickening) that can damage multiple tissues and organs. Chronic GVHD devastates the lives of up to 50% of patients who undergo an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. GVHD is considered one of the main causes of morbidity (poor health) and late non-relapse mortality after stem cell transplant. The consequences are far-reaching  both in terms of the burden it can place on the individual’s physical and emotional well-being  as well as the broader socio-economic impact.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.
