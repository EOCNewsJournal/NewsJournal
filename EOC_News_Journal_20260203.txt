Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions. VGP has a fully integrated business model with extensive expertise and many years of experience along the entire value chain.

Most importantly  none of this would be possible without the courage of the patients and families who participate in our studies  and for that we owe them a debt of gratitude.”In the LEAP2MONO study  GD3 patients receiving venglustat demonstrated statistically significant improvements in neurological symptoms measured by a global test score for two assessments  the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) modified total score and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)  at week 52 compared with those receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (p=0.007). Venglustat performed as well as ERT on non-neurological outcomes  including changes in spleen volume  liver volume  and hemoglobin levels  three key secondary endpoints of the study.Venglustat is also being studied for the treatment of Fabry disease  another rare lysosomal storage disorder. Data from the phase 3 PERIDOT study (clinical study identifier: NCT05206773) show that reduction in neuropathic and abdominal pain was observed in both study arms and the primary endpoint was not met. Additional analyses of the data are ongoing with more information to be shared at a future medical meeting. A second phase 3 study  CARAT (clinical study identifier: NCT05280548)  evaluating the effect of venglustat on left cardiac ventricular mass index in men and women with Fabry disease  is ongoing.Venglustat was well tolerated overall with no new safety signals compared with previous studies. In LEAP2MONO  the most commonly reported adverse events during treatment among patients receiving venglustat (21 individuals) compared with those receiving ERT (22 individuals) were headache (14.3% in the venglustat arm versus 18.2% in the ERT arm)  nausea (14.3% versus 4.5%)  spleen enlargement (14.3% versus 0)  and diarrhea (14.3% versus 0).Sanofi will pursue global regulatory filings for venglustat in GD3. Venglustat is investigational  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Sanofi currently markets Fabrazyme  an ERT for Fabry disease  and Cerezyme and Cerdelga for Gaucher disease  an ERT and oral therapy  respectively  in markets around the world. In January 2026  the US approved an expanded label for Cerezyme to include non-central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of GD3  building on its long-standing approval in the US for GD1. This US supplemental label expansion was based exclusively on real-world evidence and leveraged data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. With the US label expansion  Cerezyme can now be prescribed globally to patients with either GD1 or GD3.About Gaucher diseaseGaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficiency of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (also known as acid β-glucosidase)  leading to the accumulation of molecules called glycosphingolipids (GSLs)  particularly in macrophages of the spleen  liver  bone marrow  and lungs. There are three major forms within the clinical spectrum of Gaucher disease: GD1  which is characterized by the lack of (or late) central nervous system (CNS) involvement; GD2  which is the acute neuronopathic form; and GD3  which is the chronic neuronopathic form. In people with GD3  accumulation of GSLs in the CNS can result in neurological manifestations  including ataxia and cognitive deficits  in addition to the systemic manifestations seen in GD1  such as liver and spleen enlargement  anemia  thrombocytopenia  or bone disease. Systemic manifestations of GD3 are treated with ERT  but there are no approved treatments for neurologic manifestations of GD3.About Fabry diseaseFabry disease is an inherited rare lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficiency of functional alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A)  leading to a build-up of GSLs  causing progressive cellular accumulation and organ damage in the kidney  cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. Neuropathic pain  abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms are among the first clinical manifestations of Fabry disease and can substantially impact activities of daily living. Clinically  there are two major subtypes: the more severe classic phenotype that presents in childhood with little or no functional α-Gal A enzymatic activity and the non-classic phenotype that presents later in life  typically in adulthood. Non-classic patients have residual α-Gal A activity but progressively accumulate GSLs.About venglustatVenglustat is a novel  investigational oral glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (GCSi)  designed to cross the blood brain barrier (i.e.  brain-penetrant)  that has the potential to slow the progression of certain diseases by inhibiting abnormal GSL accumulation and its physio-pathologic consequences. GSLs are cellular building blocks whose abnormal accumulation is implicated in several rare diseases leading to both cell dysfunction and disease progression. Venglustat was previously granted orphan designation in the EU  the USA and Japan for its potential treatment of both GD3 and Fabry disease. It also received fast-track designation in the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for its potential use in GD3 and Fabry disease.About the LEAP2MONO studyThe LEAP2MONO phase 3 study was a double-blind  double-dummy  active-comparator  two-arm study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of once daily oral venglustat versus intravenous ERT every two weeks in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 and older with GD3. Forty-three patients were randomized [1:1] to receive venglustat and placebo infusion or ERT and placebo tablet. Patients must have been treated with ERT for at least three years and achieved therapeutic goals for systemic disease manifestations. The primary endpoints for the study was change in SARA modified total score and change in RBANS total scale index score for patients receiving venglustat versus those receiving ERT from baseline to week 52. Systemic key secondary endpoints include percent change in spleen volume  liver volume and platelet count and change in hemoglobin levels. Biomarker key secondary endpoints include percent change in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma GL1 and lyso-GL1. The LEAP2MONO study is ongoing and results from its open-label phase will be presented in the future when available.About the PERIDOT studyThe PERIDOT phase 3 study was a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of venglustat on neuropathic and abdominal pain in patients aged 16 years and older with Fabry disease. The study randomized 122 patients 1:1 to receive venglustat or placebo. Patients must have been treatment-naïve or untreated for at least six months. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline on patient-defined most bothersome symptoms (neuropathic pain in upper extremities  neuropathic pain in lower extremities or abdominal pain)  as assessed by the FD-PRO instrument  in those treated with venglustat versus placebo. Secondary endpoints include percent change from baseline in plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-3)  frequency of rescue pain medication use  change from baseline in the percentage of days with diarrhea  percent change from baseline in tiredness component of FD-PRO  and proportion of responders on the patient-defined most bothersome symptoms.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
