The pilot vaccination program will serve as the basis for post-marketing commitment studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of IXCHIQ® in a real-world setting and generating real-world evidence in a large population.The PVS  agreed between the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) and Instituto Butantan  will be implemented in ten Brazilian municipalities strategically selected based on epidemiological and operational criteria in support of the PVS. In line with the current IXCHIQ® label in Brazil  adults aged 18 to 59 years will be invited to participate  with the objective of achieving 20% to 40% vaccine coverage within the target population. Valneva  through its partner Instituto Butantan  will donate up to 500 000 doses of IXCHIQ® to the Brazilian MoH  for use in the program. IXCHIQ® was granted marketing approval in Brazil in individuals 18 years of age and older by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) in April 20251  marking the world’s first approval of a chikungunya vaccine in an endemic country.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Contributing to this large-scale pilot vaccination strategy underscores our continued commitment to supporting global preparedness against the growing threat of chikungunya. With IXCHIQ® already available in several markets  generating robust real-world data in regions with active CHIKV transmission remains critical. This program is expected to provide additional evidence of the vaccine’s performance and further reinforce its public health value.”Esper Kallas M.D.  Ph.D.  Director  Instituto Butantan  outlined the path towards the PVS  stating: ""This program stems from a deeply rigorous scientific collaboration between Valneva  Instituto Butantan  and leading arbovirus experts. Through continuous engagement with the Ministry of Health  regional health secretaries  and ANVISA  I am confident that we have built a program that is both robust and regulatory-compliant. These combined efforts are expected to enable timely access to vaccination and reduce the significant public health burden posed by this arboviral disease.""The World Health Organization has called for urgent action to prevent a potential major chikungunya epidemic from sweeping the globe2. So far  Brazil has reported the highest number of chikungunya cases worldwide  with over one million cases between January 2019 and July 20243  including 263 502 cases in 2024 alone  which resulted in 246 deaths4.Valneva and Instituto Butantan signed an agreement in January 20215 for the technology transfer of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine to Instituto Butantan  which will develop  manufacture and commercialize the vaccine in Latin America. This collaboration falls within the framework of the funding agreement between Valneva and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  with support from the European Union6.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years7. In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas3. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas8 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem9.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Following a mixed first half (-6.8%)  the second half showed solid business activity and sequential improvement  with a more limited decline in gross margin (-4.6%) compared with 2024.For the full year 2025  revenue amounted to €271.1 million and gross margin to €98.9 million  representing historically high activity levels  close to €100 million in annual gross margin. This performance should be viewed in light of a particularly high comparison base linked to the Paris 2024 celebrations  as well as the absence in 2025 of the Paris Motor Show  a biennial event whose next edition is expected in 2026.In this context  the decline in activity during the year is mainly concentrated in the events segment (€43.5 million in gross margin in 2025)  while the Consulting business maintained a high level of activity with a gross margin of €26.6 million. Among the other growth pillars  Hopscotch Season continued its momentum with a gross margin of €26.4 million  up +10.4%. Hopscotch Tourism recorded a gross margin of €9.4 million. The diversification of activities  particularly internationally  continues to represent a structural growth driver  with more than one-third of gross margin generated outside France.HOPSCOTCH will publish its consolidated 2025 annual results on Tuesday  March 31  2026  after market close.________Shareholder contactPierre-Franck MOLEY – Chief Executive Officer –Tél. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress contactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Executive Board Assistant –Tél. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCHHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group founded in France  driven by an entrepreneurial vision and the complementary nature of its talents and expertise.HOPSCOTCH is a unique combination of expertise  driven by the belief that the value of a company or organization lies in the quality of its relational capital.With more than 1 000 employees  half of whom are based internationally (40 offices across 5 continents)  HOPSCOTCH covers all areas of communication: influence  events  public relations  activations  digital  internal communication  public affairs  and marketing services.HOPSCOTCH organizes its agencies around its areas of expertise:Event: Hopscotch Event  Hopscotch Congrès  Hopscotch Moments  Sagarmatha.Public Relations: Hopscotch PR  Le Public Système PR  Human to Human  Hopscotch Décideurs.Digital and Marketing: heaven  AD Crew  Hopscotch Digital Studio.Sectorial expertise: Hopscotch Cinéma  Hopscotch Luxe  Hopscotch Season  Hopscotch Sport  Hopscotch Tourism.HOPSCOTCH has been committed to ambitious ecological and societal initiatives for over 15 years  validated by internationally recognized CSR certifications  including RSE Agences Actives  ISO 20121  and the EcoVadis Platinum medal.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris (ISIN code: ALHOP FR 00000 6527 8)  the group represents a turnover of €271 1 million and a gross margin of €98 9 million in 2025.Follow us: hopscotch.one and on LinkedIn / X / Instagram / Bluesky @HOPSCOTCHgroupeAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.17,0.25,0.58,True,English,"['HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', '2025 Revenue', 'Le Public Système PR', 'First half Second half TOTAL', 'mixed first half', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Jodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE', 'Executive Board Assistant', 'RSE Agences Actives', 'EcoVadis Platinum medal', 'high comparison base', 'other growth pillars', 'structural growth driver', 'Paris Motor Show', 'international communications group', 'high activity levels', 'Hopscotch Congrès', 'Hopscotch Décideurs', 'Hopscotch Cinéma', 'solid business activity', 'communications consulting group', 'Euronext Growth Paris', '2025 Financial Year Activity', 'Gross Margin change', 'annual gross margin', 'Hopscotch Digital Studio', 'Hopscotch PR', 'Consulting business', 'high level', 'public relations', 'public affairs', '2025 annual results', '2025 Gross Margin', '2024 Gross Margin', 'Paris 2024 celebrations', 'Press release', 'unfavorable start', 'unaudited data', 'major player', 'social media', 'sequential improvement', 'full year', 'next edition', 'market close', 'Shareholder contact', 'Pierre-Franck MOLEY', 'Tél', 'Press contact', 'entrepreneurial vision', 'complementary nature', 'unique combination', 'relational capital', 'AD Crew', 'ambitious ecological', 'societal initiatives', 'CSR certifications', 'ISIN code', 'ALHOP FR', 'Revenue change', 'HOPSCOTCH GROUPE', 'Hopscotch Season', 'Hopscotch Tourism', 'Hopscotch Moments', 'Hopscotch Luxe', 'Hopscotch Sport', 'biennial event', 'limited decline', 'internal communication', 'marketing services', 'Hopscotch Event', 'events segment', 'HOPSCOTCHgroupe Attachment', 'Sectorial expertise', 'consolidated revenue', '2025 Revenue', '2024 Revenue', 'February', 'Section', 'thousands', 'euros', 'December', 'performance', 'light', 'absence', 'context', 'momentum', 'diversification', 'activities', 'one-third', 'France', 'Tuesday', 'March', 'pfmoley', 'jodiekc', 'talents', 'belief', 'value', 'company', 'organization', 'quality', '1,000 employees', '40 offices', '5 continents', 'areas', 'influence', 'activations', 'agencies', 'Sagarmatha', 'heaven', '15 years', 'turnover', 'LinkedIn', 'Instagram', 'Bluesky', '30', '783']",2026-02-03,2026-02-04,globenewswire.com

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) today announced 2026 financial guidance and will highlight its advancing clinical-stage rare disease pipeline  including two major value-creating programs  at a virtual Investor Day taking place later today.The Investor Day will focus on the scientific rationale  clinical strategy  and long‑term opportunity underpinning Pharming’s pipeline programs in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)‑driven mitochondrial disease.Fabrice Chouraqui  Chief Executive Officer of Pharming  commented:“Pharming’s vision of developing into a leading global rare disease company is grounded in the strength of our two commercial products and our high-value pipeline. We expect our commercial portfolio to continue delivering robust growth  with total revenues between US$405 million and US$425 million in 2026. We are excited to showcase the breadth and quality of our pipeline at today’s Investor Day. Leniolisib and napazimone (KL1333) are being developed for large  underserved rare disease populations with significant unmet need  and are supported by a strong and growing body of biological and clinical evidence. We believe both programs offer substantial long‑term value‑creating potential for Pharming.”2026 financial guidance:Total revenues between US$405 million and US$425 million (8% to 13% growth)  driven by significant and accelerating growth for Joenja® and continued growth for RUCONEST®Total operating expenses between US$330 million and US$335 million  with the increase driven primarily by an increase in Research & Development expenses related to the ongoing leniolisib Phase II clinical trials and the napazimone (KL1333) pivotal clinical trialPipeline overview:Leniolisib – primary immunodeficiencies with immune dysregulationPharming management will outline the scientific and clinical rationale supporting the expansion of leniolisib into broader patient populations with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulation  beyond its currently approved indication. Two Phase II proof‑of‑concept clinical trials are ongoing — one in genetically defined PIDs linked to PI3K signaling and one in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with immune dysregulation — with top‑line data for both trials expected in the second half of 2026.Leniolisib is an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3‑kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor that is currently approved and marketed as Joenja in the United States  and marketed and/or approved in additional countries  as the first and only targeted treatment for activated PI3Kδ syndrome (APDS)1  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency  for patients 12 years of age and older. APDS represents a genetically defined form within the broader CVID spectrum and serves as a clinically validated proof‑of‑concept for targeting PI3Kδ‑driven immune dysregulation  supporting the potential applicability of leniolisib across significantly broader PID and CVID patient populations.Napazimone (KL1333)– mtDNA-driven mitochondrial diseasePharming management will outline the scientific and clinical rationale for napazimone (KL1333)  the newly named compound being developed for mtDNA-driven mitochondrial disease  which has the potential to become the first standard of care in this setting  if approved. The pivotal FALCON clinical trial is ongoing and remains on track for a readout in 2027.Napazimone (KL1333) is an investigational therapy being developed for adult patients with primary mitochondrial disease caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations — a rare and debilitating condition characterized by impaired energy production  significant fatigue and muscle weakness (myopathy)  and reduced life expectancy.Clinical expert perspectivesThe Investor Day will feature presentations from leading clinical experts  providing context on disease biology  unmet medical need  and the potential role of Pharming’s programs.Jocelyn Farmer  MD  PhD  Lahey Hospital & Medical Center — an internationally recognized authority on CVID and immune dysregulationAmel Karaa  MD  Massachusetts General Hospital  Harvard Medical School — an internationally recognized authority on mitochondrial medicineInvestor Day webcast information:The Investor Day event will be held today  Tuesday  February 3  from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. EST (16:00 to 18:00 CET).

The 29% year-on-year decrease  reported  reflects a -22% change at constant exchange rates and scope and a -7% currency impact.Pierre Barnabé  CEO of Soitec  commented: “While Q3’26 revenue came in above guidance  driven by a solid performance by Soitec’s teams  we are maintaining our prudent stance on end market dynamics. Strong momentum in Artificial Intelligence is offset by continued weakness in the Automotive market and ongoing inventory correction in RF-SOI. We are closely monitoring the evolution of the smartphone market outlook and its potential impact on this correction.The path we are on is clear: we are working towards generating positive Free Cash Flow in FY'26. Then  as customer inventory correction progresses  Soitec revenue should stabilize and Free Cash Flow generation should improve. Meanwhile  we are committed to managing costs and cash rigorously  while selectively investing in our technology roadmap to support future growth opportunities in our increasingly diversified markets. I am proud of the teams’ commitment  which is positioning the company to benefit fully from the next growth cycle.”Q3’26 revenue – Focus on execution amid sustained year-on-year pressureQ3'26 revenue by end market(Euro millions)Q3’26Q3’25y/y change (reported) y/y change (at constant FX & scope) Mobile Communications 90 154 -42% -36% Edge & Cloud AI 54 47 15% 27% Automotive & Industrial 16 25 -37% -32% Revenue 160 226 -29% -22%Soitec generated Q3’26 revenue of €160 million  down 29% year-on-year  reported (18% sequential increase at constant exchange rates and scope  compared with Q2’26).Mobile Communications Market (56% of total revenue) - Inventory correction continues to weigh on RF-SOI volumesQ3’26 Mobile Communications revenue reached €90 million  down 36% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and scope. Despite a low-single-digit mobile market growth and higher mix of premium devices in 2025  the RF mobile market remains under pressure due to the ongoing inventory correction.Lower RF-SOI revenue in Q3’26 year-on-year reflects ongoing customer inventory reduction. While the correction is progressing as expected and moving in the right direction  customer inventory levels remain elevated.POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) sales were slightly down year-on-year  while showing a sequential improvement  as increasing volumes from Tier-1 US fabless offset softer demand in Asia. Customer engagement remains active  with ongoing qualifications and key design wins in premium smartphone platforms  supporting continued adoption in advanced RF filters. Tier-1 US Fabless now driving meaningful volumes.While adoption continues through targeted design wins in next-generation connectivity solutions  FD-SOI sales remain subdued. FD-SOI adoption for 5G mmWave is still ongoing with a major recent design win for US flagship smartphones.Edge & Cloud AI Market (34% of total revenue) - Robust performance supported by AI-related demandEdge & Cloud AI revenue reached €54 million in Q3’26  up 27% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and scope  and improving from Q2’26. The activity continues to be supported by demand in AI-related applications across Edge and Cloud environments. The growth in revenue reflects continued supply chain investments in Datacenter infrastructure and the expansion of low-power computing applications.Photonics-SOI continues its strong momentum in a high-demand data center infrastructure environment  as the technology enables a growing number of high-speed  high-bandwidth optical interconnect applications  including pluggable transceivers and Co-Packaged Optics (CPO).FD-SOI sales increased year-on-year and showed robust sequential improvement vs Q2’26  supported by demand from AI-enabled IoT applications across consumer  virtual reality  industrial and healthcare segments. FD-SOI market traction is improving  as confirmed by the launch of leading AI wearables powered by FD-SOI in Q3’26.Automotive & Industrial Market (10% of total revenue) - Ongoing market weakness  with some excess customer inventoryAutomotive & Industrial revenue was €16 million in Q3’26  down 32% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and scope  while improving sequentially from Q2’26. Market conditions remained subdued with some excess customer inventory. Customers continue to prioritize inventory reduction  and any improvement in end demand is expected to translate into Soitec’s volumes with a lag.Power-SOI volumes remained low  reflecting continued weakness in the automotive end market  as well as delivery phasing under a long-term agreement with a key customer  with higher volumes expected in the March quarter. Power-SOI is a key technology that enables reliable  high-performance and safe power electronics  such as Battery Management Systems (BMS) and power control circuits used with advanced power semiconductors. Soitec continues to drive the transition to 300mm to meet growing demand for BMS and other vehicle electrification applications.FD-SOI adoption continued across automotive and industrial applications  although volumes increase remains constrained due to long qualification time of these applications. FD-SOI enables the fusion of radar sensing and AI  empowering next-generation systems to perceive  process  and respond to their environment autonomously.SmartSiCTM activity remained limited  focused on customer qualifications and selective engagement.9M’26 revenue9M'26 revenue by end market(Euro millions)9m’269m’25y/y change (reported) y/y change (at constant FX & scope) Mobile Communications 209 326 -36% -33% Edge & Cloud AI 150 154 -2% 9% Automotive & Industrial 31 84 -63% -61% Revenue 390 564 -31% -26%Revenue in the first nine months of FY'26 reached €390 million  down 31% year-on-year on a reported basis  with performance continuing to reflect prolonged customer inventory correction and contrasted dynamics across end-markets.
