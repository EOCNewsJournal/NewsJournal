(Euronext: ONWD and US OTCQX: ONWRY)  the neurotechnology company pioneering spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence  today announces the enrollment of the first participant in Empower BP  a global pivotal study assessing the safety and effectiveness of the investigational ARC-IM® System in managing symptomatic blood pressure instability in people with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).Empower BP is the first global pivotal study to evaluate the Company’s implantable spinal cord stimulation system. The randomized  double-blinded  sham-controlled study is expected to involve participants across approximately 20 leading neurorehabilitation and neurosurgical research centers in the US  Canada  France  Germany  Spain  and the UK. The study targets individuals with injuries at spinal cord levels C2-T6 and injury severities of AIS A-D. The first participant was enrolled at Craig Hospital in Denver  Colorado.“The initiation of Empower BP marks another significant milestone in our journey to restore critical autonomic functions impacted by spinal cord injury ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. “The ARC-IM System is designed to address several unmet needs after SCI  including symptomatic blood pressure instability. The clinical feasibility results published last year in Nature Medicine were outstanding  and we are hopeful Empower BP will provide the data needed to bring this important therapy to hospitals and clinics worldwide.”Blood pressure instability is a key unmet need after SCI  characterized by chronic orthostatic hypotension and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia1. Among individuals with tetraplegia  78% are diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension  yet only 28% receive treatment – and of those  91% continue to experience symptoms including dizziness  lightheadedness  blurred vision  and fatigue. Over time  persistent low blood pressure can threaten neurological recovery and negatively impact cardiovascular health.2 3“Blood pressure instability is a silent yet debilitating complication of spinal cord injury  with serious consequences for cardiovascular health and quality of life ” said Dr. Candy Tefertiller  Executive Director of Research and Evaluation at Craig Hospital and Empower BP Principal Investigator. “We are eager to evaluate the potential of ARC-IM Therapy to improve hemodynamic stability through precise stimulation of the spinal cord region responsible for blood pressure regulation.”The Company’s ARC-IM System comprises the implanted ONWARD Neurostimulator and the ARC-IM Thoracic Lead  optimized for surgical placement in the specific region of the thoracic spinal cord containing a high density of neurons that regulate blood pressure. Published in Nature Medicine in September 2025  detailed results from multi-year clinical feasibility studies show that participants who received ARC-IM Therapy saw immediate and robust increases in blood pressure  as well as reduced frequency and severity of hypotensive symptoms. The enhanced hemodynamic stability resulted in improved quality of life and greater engagement in rehabilitation and daily life activities. Additional benefits included reduced fatigue  improved bowel management  and increased tolerance of upright postures. Participants reduced or discontinued traditional treatments for low blood pressure  including compression garments and medications. Benefits were observed for the duration of the studies  which lasted up to two years following implant.4To learn more about the Empower BP study and view a list of active centers in your area  please visit the following webpage.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD Medical is the leading neurotechnology company pioneering therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and other movement disabilities.

What began as a shared commitment by employers is now reinforced by new research underscoring the measurable impact that supportive workplace policies can have on employee health and quality of life.A newly conducted review led by Dr. Victoria Blinder  oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  and Dr. Gina Mazza  Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Mayo Clinic  highlights evidence of a link between sustained employment  or return to work  after a cancer diagnosis and improved health-related quality of life. Dr Blinder adds that workplace conditions can play a role in shaping these outcomes  reinforcing the importance of flexibility  understanding  and appropriate accommodations during treatment and recovery.The studies reviewed include data such as:Employed survivors report ~28% better overall quality of life (QOL) than non-employed at 5 years.Physical functioning remained ~29% higher in employed survivors at 5 yearsEmployed participants in one study were approximately 3.7x less likely to report moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms  and 2.4x less likely to report moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms  than unemployed participantsFrom Evidence to Action: An AI Coach Inspired by the StudyGrounded in these findings  Working With Cancer has developed a new AI-powered coach  designed to help employers translate these insights into personalized  practical support for employees living with cancer. Watch the demo HERE.Available to all companies that sign the Working With Cancer pledge  the coach enables organizations to communicate and adapt their health  benefits  and workplace policies to the individual needs of each employee. Built on Large Language Models and designed to address pain points experienced by patients  managers  HR and benefits leads  it includes purpose-built safeguards  allowing companies to securely upload their own policies so employees receive guidance tailored to their actual situation.The AI system draws from curated  vetted resources from Working With Cancer’s expert partners  delivering accurate  transparent responses while avoiding the risks associated with open-internet health queries. A task-specific  multi-agent architecture supports cancer patients  managers  and colleagues with context-aware guidance  with strict boundaries that prevent medical diagnosis. Privacy and anonymity are foundational  with no data retained beyond each session.A Global Campaign Calling on Employers to ActWith this growing evidence linking work  under the right conditions  to positive health outcomes for cancer patients  Working With Cancer is launching a global campaign to encourage more companies to sign the pledge and help extend these benefits to more employees.Through a film (click HERE to view) created by Publicis Conseil and supported by up to $100 million in pro bono media donated by partners including Disney  Google/ Youtube  Zeta Global  TikTok  NBCUniversal  Paramount  iHeartMedia  Westwood One  Clear Channel Outdoor  Captivate  Screenvision  and NCM  the campaign makes clear that employers are not peripheral to the cancer experience. They can be a meaningful part of recovery  dignity  and quality of life.Directed by Kailee McGee  a stage IV cancer survivor and award-winning filmmaker  the campaign features survivors from all walks of life—including CEOs  celebrities  and employees—sharing how working helped them maintain normalcy and control during treatment. Participants include survivors from Walmart  L’Oréal  Pfizer  Barclays  Accenture  and Carrefour  among others.With photographs by Sandro Miller a renowned portrait photographer and a stage 4 cancer survivor  the campaign will appear in a Times Square out-of-home takeover on February 4  in recognition of World Cancer Day.About Publicis Groupe - The Power of OnePublicis Groupe [Euronext Paris FR0000130577  CAC 40] is a global leader in communication.

Henkel benefits from a strong track record in innovation  technology leadership and sustainability.The contemplated transaction values Stahl at a level that would yield total net proceeds at completion (after debt and transaction costs) of c.€1.2 billion for Wendel. This corresponds to a multiple of 6.6 times (net) Wendel’s total investment since 2006  including €427m of past proceeds thanks to Stahl’s robust cash generation. This represents an annualized IRR of over 15% over 20 years. This compares with a value of €960 million in Wendel’s net asset value (“NAV”) published before the transaction announcement  as of September 30  2025.In addition to Wendel (68.5% of the capital)  BASF (16.1%)  Clariant (14.6%) and other minority shareholders will also sell their interests in Stahl to Henkel. The transaction is subject to mandatory consultation processes and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals.A 20-year successful transformation and development under Wendel’s ownershipStahl is the global leader in specialty coatings for flexible materials. The Group benefits from favourable end-market trends – particularly in premium consumer segments – strong exposure to high-growth regions (such as Asia)  and a product portfolio driven by sustainable  water-based technologies. In addition  Stahl has successfully built attractive positions in fast-growing niches for specialty coatings. The early identification of consolidation and expansion opportunities  combined with rigorous financial discipline throughout Wendel’s ownership  has enabled Stahl to broaden its expertise and further strengthen its market leadership.Between 2006 and 2024  under Wendel’s ownership  Stahl's global sales nearly tripled  from €316 million to €930 million (including wet-end leather chemicals activities  now operating under Muno and not part of the current transaction). This remarkable growth was supported by a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions  including the acquisition of Clariant’s Leather Services business in 2013  Eagle performance in 2016  BASF’s Leather Chemicals business in 2017  ICP Industrial Solutions Group in 2023  and Weilburger Graphics in 2024.Over the same period  Stahl’s profitability improved materially  with adjusted operating income increasing fourfold  from €44 million to €181 million  and adjusted operating margin expanding by 550 bps to 19.5% in 2024.In parallel  Stahl has established itself as a recognized ESG frontrunner in its industry. The Group has built a leading sustainability track record  reflected in four consecutive Ecovadis Platinum ratings since 2021  set ambitious SBTi validated reduction targets  and developed strong capabilities in sustainable innovation. With a product portfolio increasingly aligned with customer sustainability expectations and tightening regulatory requirements  Stahl is well positioned to support its customers’ ESG transition while delivering long-term  responsible growth.Early 2026  Stahl announced the completion of its multi-year strategic transformation  marking its evolution into a pure-play speciality coatings formulator for flexible materials  by divesting its wet-end leather chemicals activities. The wet-end business is now a standalone company named Muno  majority-owned by Wendel  together with minority shareholders BASF and Clariant.Laurent Mignon  Wendel Group CEO  commented: “Over the last 20 years  Wendel has worked alongside Stahl's talented and committed management teams to transform the company into the undisputed global leader in its sector. After two decades of active support  we are proud to see Stahl continue its industrial and commercial development within an industrial leader such as Henkel.The transaction announced today is fully in line with our capital allocation strategy announced during our December 2025 Capital Market Day and is a great illustration of the quality of Wendel Principal Investments (WPI) assets and the cautiousness of their value in our Net Asset Value  with a value to be realized representing a premium of over 20%. It also represents a first successful illustration of the efficiency of the advisory mandate given to IK Partners.The sale of Stahl is a key milestone in the execution of the roadmap presented early December and will allow Wendel to fulfil its objectives of long-term value creation through its private assets investments  the development of Wendel Investment Managers (WIM) as a first-class private asset management platform and superior return to shareholders. It will allow us to execute the share buyback programme as announced at the Capital Market Day  after the release of our 2025 earnings.”Maarten Heijbroek  CEO of Stahl: “We are deeply grateful to Wendel for the long-term partnership and support that have shaped Stahl’s trajectory over the past two decades. Under Wendel’s ownership  Stahl has undergone a significant transformation into a focused  pure‑play specialty coatings company with a strong global footprint  strengthened technologies  and a resilient market position. This transformation means we are now well‑positioned for further growth.”As we move into our next chapter under the Henkel umbrella  we believe this transaction will further strengthen our leadership position in specialty coatings for flexible materials. Henkel’s strong innovation capabilities will further enhance the value we deliver to our customers  and our shared values make this a natural and exciting next step for Stahl.”AgendaThursday  February 26  2026Full-Year 2025 Results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2025  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (before-market release)Thursday  April 23  2026Q1 2026 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2026 (before-market release)Thursday  May 21  2026Annual General MeetingThursday  July 30  2026H1 2026 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2026  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (before-market release)About WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

The partnership aims to expand joint defense capabilities for European and global markets.The agreement is a significant step toward strengthening defense cooperation not only in Central and Eastern Europe  but also worldwide. The newly established joint venture will focus on technical cooperation in key areas such as air defence  electronic warfare  smart munitions  and border security. As part of the system localization  production is planned to be transferred to CSG facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.One of the first concrete outcomes of this partnership is the integration of the Korkut air defense system onto the Tatra Force 6×6 wheeled platform. The system is intended for European customers as well as for the global market and represents a fully capable alternative to similar European air defence systems.“The Korkut system represents a modern and highly effective air defense solution  particularly against enemy UAVs. It uses highly accurate  programmable ammunition  which in practice means that the cost of neutralizing a single UAV is comparable to the acquisition cost of the UAV itself. Such cost efficiency cannot be achieved by conventional missile-based air defense systems ” says Miloš Šivara  CEO of Excalibur International.Given the developments observed on the modern battlefield  which clearly demonstrate the growing importance of highly mobile and effective defense against unmanned aerial systems  the Korkut system integrated on a proven Tatra platform is expected to quickly attract customer interest and secure a strong position in the international market.About CSGCSG N.V.

The ETP initially listed on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam and is issued and domiciled in Germany.The ETP physically replicates the Diaman Bitcoin & Gold Index  which applies a dynamic  rules-based allocation between Bitcoin and gold. The index methodology adjusts the relative weight of each asset based on predefined risk indicators  with the objective of reflecting changing market conditions over time. The approach is designed to provide exposure to assets with different characteristics within a single exchange-traded structure  allowing investors to gain exposure to the characteristics of both Bitcoin and gold.Bradley Duke  Managing Director and Head of Europe at Bitwise  commented: “At Bitwise  we are delighted to be able to list Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP (“BTCG”) on Xetra  bringing such an innovative product to the largest European exchange for Crypto ETPs. We are very proud of the work we did with Diaman Partners in bringing BTCG to investors  offering exposure to Bitcoin and Gold  two assets with historically different correlation characteristics.""The ETP rebalances Bitcoin and gold allocations monthly based on the Diaman Bitcoin & Gold index methodology that uses ULCER indices  a volatility measure originally developed in the late 1980s  to assess downside risk and inform allocation decisions. The ETP is fully backed by physical Bitcoin and by Pax Gold (PAXG)  a token linked to physical gold held in LBMA-accredited vaults in London. The underlying assets are held with an institutional custodian using offline (cold-storage) custody arrangements.Daniele Bernardi  CEO of Diaman Partners  said: “The Bitcoin & Gold Index has been designed to provide investors with dynamic exposure to two scarce  complementary assets  capable of contributing to portfolio diversification: Bitcoin and gold. The listing on Xetra expands the range of trading venues on which BTCG ETP is available.”Gold and Bitcoin in a Changing Macro EnvironmentGold and Bitcoin have historically exhibited different behaviours across market environments. Gold has generally shown lower volatility relative to many risk assets during periods of market stress  while Bitcoin has tended to display higher volatility and greater sensitivity to changes in investor risk appetite. As a result  the two assets may respond differently to macroeconomic developments and market cycles.Recent economic  monetary  and geopolitical developments have renewed interest in assets often perceived as stores of value. Gold has traditionally fulfilled this role  supported by its physical scarcity and long-standing role in financial markets. Bitcoin  by contrast  has emerged as a digital asset with distinct structural characteristics  including a defined supply framework and the ability to be transferred without reliance on centralized intermediaries.Key Product DetailsETP Name Bitwise Diaman Bitcoin & Gold ETP Primary Ticker BTCG ISIN DE000A4AKW34 Listings Xetra  Euronext PR & AMS  NASDAQ Stockholm TER 1.49% p.a.

The Group is also strengthening its circularity approach  notably through the integration of recycled aluminium and its commitments to increase the use of recycled polyethylene (PE).This initiative is in line with the Group's announcements on the expansion of its low-carbon offering: in 2025  Nexans had already announced that its low-voltage aluminum cables produced in France would incorporate 10% recycled content  illustrating the acceleration of its circularity strategy.A long-term relationship with EnedisThis new success is part of a long-standing partnership that continues after a major contract signed in October 2024 for low-voltage underground cables.Marco Spinelli  Managing Director of PWR Grid Central Europe at Nexans  comments: ""We are proud to strengthen our long-term partnership with Enedis at a key moment for the electrification of uses in France. This contract illustrates Nexans' ability to combine economic performance  security of supply and environmental requirements  thanks to an industrial base mainly located in Bourg-en-Bresse and backed by European capabilities.

The deal is expected to close by June.In Orange County  Peet’s Coffee locations on El Toro Road in Lake Forest  E. 17th Street in Costa Mesa  and Avenida Talega in San Clemente  closed at the end of January  according to several workers who declined to be identified and Yelp reports on the locations.Stores also closed Jan. 30 in the South Bay communities of Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach.In a statement emailed to the Southern California News Group  a Peet’s spokesperson declined to say how many stores would be closed in Southern California. The spokesperson did state that the chain made a “difficult decision” to close a number of Peet’s Coffee locations by the end of January but declined to elaborate.“These closures reflect a broader effort to align our business with long-term growth priorities and current market conditions ” the spokesperson said. “We are deeply grateful to our incredible employees and loyal customers for their continued commitment to the brand. As we move forward  we remain dedicated to the quality  craftsmanship  and heritage that have defined Peet’s for the past 60 years  while embracing new opportunities to innovate and grow.”In December  roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 33.6% more than it did a year earlier  rising to an average $9.053 per pound from $6.776 per pound  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Along with coffee bean supply shortages  widespread import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on top coffee producers in Brazil and Vietnam were to blame for the price increases.Over a week ago  unionized workers at one of the chain’s Northern California locations wrote on Instagram that Peet’s Coffee closed 27  or 9.5%  of its 283 locations nationwide after Keurig Dr. Pepper launched its all-cash takeover of JDE.As of Feb. 3  2026. Peet’s reported 256 stores nationwide  including 166 in Northern California and 36 in Southern California. Peet’s spokesperson declined to specify how many were company-owned or franchised locations. In 2024  Peet’s said that it had 199 company-owned locations  with 168 in California.Peet’s was founded by Dutch immigrant Alfred Peet  a German labor-camp survivor whose family ran a coffee-roasting business. The first location opened in Berkeley in 1966  with Peet’s eventually going public in 2001.

Frangou in Argentina  and the Romanian billionaires at Praktiker,Greek Shipowners Behind the Scenes of Global Energy & the “Hellenic Ammunition”The post The “poison” poll for Karystianou and Tsipras  Thymios at M.M.  Frangou in Argentina  and the Romanian billionaires at Praktiker appeared first on ProtoThema English.,Newsroom February 4 12:43Hello  sometimes the information I have is not completely fresh—what we call “fish of the day”—but I think it is always reliable. So I’m passing on to you a poll that was obviously not published  because it contained “over-the-limit” figures and voting intention for Karystianou as well as for Tsipras  who  as is well known  have not yet announced parties  so formally this is not customary. However  the question was asked for substantive reasons and was phrased something like this: “If Tsipras or (and) Karystianou were to announce a party  what would you vote for?” So  ND does not appear to be affected (it is where it is in other polls  at 29.5%–30%)  but President Maria shoots up to 15%  our beloved Alexis to 10%  and PASOK falls to 9%  while Zoe along with Velopoulos is at 7%. Let me clarify that the same polling company  before this hypothetical question about a Tsipras and Karystianou party  also conducted a poll without the addition of the two new players  which produced the same results as MRB’s—namely ND first  Zoe second  and PASOK third. I also asked my source whether  when the poll with this “toxic” hypothetical question about President Maria K. and Tsipras was conducted  Karystianou’s position on abortions had been taken into account. The answer I received was that when the survey was completed  Karystianou had not yet made her anti-abortion statement  but I was assured that it does not play such a big role in public opinion anyway. Now  they also told me about another important finding: half of those who would vote for Tsipras might also vote for Karystianou  and one third of those who would vote for Maria K. could also go with Alexis. A real mess  right? You understand what is going to happen on the political scene as soon as these two parties appear on the stage. Finally  I asked whether M.M. is aware of this survey  and they answered “bien sûr ” as the French say—and with great precision  in fact.Thymios at M.M.Many were surprised yesterday to see the legendary Thymios Lymperopoulos of the taxi drivers walk through the doors of M.M. with a sheet of demands  and even though he did not have an appointment  he was received by K.M.’s adviser  Thanasis Nezis  who has known him for decades and was the day before yesterday in Kalamata with Samaras and Karamanlis—so he is battle-hardened. I hear that Thymios was very happy that they received him  but at the beginning of the conversation Nezis made it clear to him that “you’re not going to curse Kyranakis to me ” and warned him to leave the… communist stuff aside  which broke the ice. In general  Thymios presented a series of demands  Nezis said he would pass them on to Mitsotakis  but now I don’t believe that Mitsotakis will sit at the same table with Thymios  nor is it really the prime minister’s job. Still  a little “massage” of the Thymioses from time to time doesn’t hurt  since taxis are historically considered “vote multipliers ” although personally I don’t believe that at all. I also hear that by chance at M.M. Thymios saw Giorgos Floridis  who had gone there for another matter  and raised with him the issue of a change made in 2022 to the provisions of the law concerning the criminal record required for a taxi license. The tasty bit is that Floridis and Thymios exchanged phone numbers to talk about it—now what they’ll talk about is another story.The meeting on the ConstitutionMitsotakis may have opened the discussion on the Constitution and asked ND MPs to formulate their own thoughts by February  but that doesn’t mean there won’t be meetings as well. For example  I hear that Gerapetritis–Koutnatzis and Evripidis Stylianidis (who is heading to be ND’s rapporteur)—that is  the “hard core” of the revision—will have a first discussion tomorrow  Thursday.After the French  the AmericansLast week  when the French Minister of Defense Ms. Vautrin came to Athens  it was announced that technical talks are moving forward so that in the coming weeks the Greece–France defense agreement will be renewed. This will obviously be signed with the presence of K.M. and Macron. I hear that Dendias is discussing something similar with the Americans; yesterday at the Pentagon he met Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. Within the framework of the Greece–U.S. strategic dialogue  the renewal of the bilateral defense cooperation agreement is on the table anyway  while I hear that in the coming days Dendias is also packing his bags for India.Arm in arm  the outgoing and the incomingStaying with geopolitics  the Mitsotakis–Erdoğan meeting is “locking in ” logically for next Wednesday the 11th (pending confirmation). A person of mine who was yesterday at M.M. saw at one point Ambassador Nikolaidis  current diplomatic adviser to K.M. and his regular interpreter in meetings with Erdoğan  walking out… arm in arm with our former ambassador to the U.S.  Katerina Nasika. What’s the peculiarity? At the end of February  Milton departs for our embassy in Paris  where he succeeds Antonis Alexandridis  who went to Washington in place of Nasika  and Nasika officially takes over as director of K.M.’s diplomatic office. As a result  the “old hand” Nikolaidis will go to Ankara.Samaras at the Presidential MansionThe President of the Republic  Kostas Tasoulas  and former prime minister Antonis Samaras spoke again yesterday  Tuesday  by phone in a warm atmosphere  as I learn from a source who knows them both well. They discussed at length the celebration of the Presentation of Christ at the Temple in Kalamata  where  as is known  the two former ND prime ministers—Samaras and Kostas Karamanlis  who was also made an honorary citizen of the city—played leading roles. Samaras told Tasoulas that he intends to remain in Kalamata for a few more days and will most likely return to Athens on Thursday  so the meeting of the two “Averoff brothers” at the Presidential Mansion is expected to take place sometime next week.Ch. Megalou at MaximosThe CEO of Piraeus Bank  Christos Megalou  visited the Maximos Mansion yesterday. Information indicates that he met with officials from the Prime Minister’s Office  but not with the Prime Minister himself.The Romanian billionaires of Praktiker got to workThe Romanians of Paval Holdings  owned by Dragos and Adrian Paval—among the wealthiest in their country  with activities in real estate  the automotive industry  energy  manufacturing  etc.—are putting Praktiker in order. After the deal with Fairfax–Eurobank for the acquisition of the well-known home-improvement chain  the investment group  via Dedeman  the leader in Romania’s DIY market  drew up a plan for Praktiker’s transformation. In this context  a €14 million capital increase took place  which had been decided by the company’s shareholders’ general meeting last November. Based on Praktiker Hellas’s most recent financial results  in 2024 the company had pre-tax losses of €1.6 million and its equity had fallen below half of its share capital—hence the capital increase. At the same time  total short-term liabilities exceeded short-term receivables  and the company had secured revolving credit facilities of €30 million. It is recalled that as part of the acquisition  Praktiker Hellas had agreed with Eurobank to acquire all the properties it had previously leased. That’s the financial side; operationally  the reorganization of the chain is moving forward  gradually adopting the Dedeman model and  in the long run  its brand name. Dedeman today has 64 DIY stores in Romania  5 logistics centers  an owned transport fleet  and more than 13 500 employees  and is one of Romania’s business success stories  having grown from a 16-sq-meter shop into the country’s leading DIY retailer.RAAEY: The game opens for the vice-president positionAfter closing the front on selecting the Authority’s president and the vice-president for Water  the Energy sector now takes the baton. According to information  the clock is counting down to the announcement of the vice-president for Energy at RAAEY  as the term of the current vice-president  Dimitris Fourlaris  expires the month after next. This position is considered one of the most critical within the Authority  as it concentrates the main volume of regulatory decisions concerning the electricity and natural gas market. From tariffs and supply rules to interconnections  networks  and major projects  the vice-president for Energy is constantly at the center of political and business pressures. The backstage around the candidacies remains  for now  murky. No public figures have yet emerged declaring an intention to run  while in the market there is a sense that it will be difficult to find a strong outsider with a clean profile and the willingness to take on the risk of the position. The only almost certain thing is that the current vice-president will seek a new term  having the advantage of experience and knowledge of the internal balances. In the background  it is noted that he has been at the center of the most difficult periods of the market in recent years  with his portfolio including a series of issues of high political and regulatory intensity. In any case  it is considered a given that he has experience in the subject matter and knowledge of the Authority’s internal procedures  elements that make him one of the key “players” in the discussion about the next day. Whether this will translate into a second term or whether the government will choose to open the game with new faces will soon become clear and will depend on the broader balances forming in the energy sector.Barclays is concerned about Athens AirportBarclays upgraded Fraport’s stock to “Overweight” with a target of €90.50  while maintaining Athens International Airport as “Underweight” with a target of €10.10. Of interest is Barclays analysts’ perspective on European airport infrastructure in 2026. They start with the observation that Fraport  despite its German DNA  draws strength from its Greek portfolio—the 14 regional airports that mainly serve tourist traffic in our country. By contrast  Athens International Airport  although benefiting from strong traffic  faces—according to them—a “regulatory cap” problem. Its regulatory framework limits returns despite a +13.1% increase in traffic. With an EBITDA margin of 58.5% in 2027 and a dividend of 5.9%  AIA’s fundamentals are strong  but the stock has already run above “fair value.” Barclays sees upside for the stock only up to €14.10  while in a downside scenario it goes to €7.30. Fraport  therefore  is considered a “growth story” with additional operational upside  while AIA is seen as a “quality story” with limited upward potential. AIA’s regulatory operating framework ensures stability but traps value creation. All this at a time when the German economy remains weak and Fraport draws its strength from the Greek tourism recovery and from Greek expansions by third companies (e.g.  Condor)  thus benefiting from rising Mediterranean demand. By contrast  Athens today appears strong and profitable  but with limited benefit for shareholders until the next regulatory review after 2032.At ADMIE they are waiting for the green light from the Ministry of EnergyThe starting signal will be given any moment now. The management of ADMIE Holdings is waiting for the order from the Ministry of Energy to convene its Board of Directors  which will ask the subsidiary to call a general meeting to approve a €1 billion share capital increase. The stock stands steadily above a €705 million market capitalization. The initial intentions of the economic staff—to use the capital increase to open ADMIE’s shareholder base and bring in new foreign investors—gave way to the logic of the status quo: not to change shareholder balances now. The Greek State will put in €251 million; the Chinese State Grid  with 20% of the share capital  will put in €200 million  having officially declared that it will contribute whatever more is needed. ADMIE Holdings’ management  in Paris at an investment day organized by Piraeus Securities  met with investors willing to sign capital commitment letters to participate if required. This whole process is extremely time-consuming. From the moment the order comes from the Ministry of Energy  it will take no less than at least eight months to complete the capital strengthening process that ADMIE so badly needs.Peter L.’s joint ventureThe significance of Global Chartering’s recent move lies not only in the ship or the price  but in the identity of the buyer. It is a joint venture between ArcelorMittal  the world’s largest steel group  and tycoon Peter Livanos  one of the most experienced names in international shipping. That alone changes the weight of the interpretation. When such a partnership chooses Japanese-built second-hand capesize tonnage  the market does not see it as an opportunistic trade  but as a vertical strategy. The industrial player knows demand from the inside. The shipping player knows the cycle  liquidity  and timing. The combination does not bet on circumstances—it prices them in. In an environment of limited supply of quality second-hand ships and growing uncertainty around newbuildings and regulations  this type of joint venture functions as a “smart market filter” that builds optionality. Wall Street reads these moves with a clear eye. When steel and shipping experience sit at the same table  the bet is not short-term.Frangou  Milei  and ArgentinaIn early 2021  Navios South American Logistics  controlled by Angeliki Frangou  filed its first documents for a public offering in New York. However  in November 2024  the company decided to withdraw the registration  leaving open the future of a new IPO in another market. The company  which manages port terminals  tugboats  and ferries in South America  is now carefully examining markets such as São Paulo in Brazil  where capital markets may offer a better valuation than New York. Last year it tapped the Scandinavian market to sell $400 million in bonds at an interest rate of 8.9%  lower than the initial target (9–9.3%). Despite the fact that Navios had until recently avoided major investments in Argentina due to “country risk ” the election of Javier Milei to the presidency appears to have changed the data. The president  known for his unconventional appearances and carefully “theatrical” moves  is pursuing a more pro-business policy  opening new prospects for companies like Navios. Behind the scenes  discussions about a new IPO in markets with higher valuation and cautious financing reveal a company that knows when to move and when to wait.Greek Shipowners Behind the Scenes of Global EnergyIn a period of intense geopolitical realignment and energy uncertainty  Greek-owned shipping is proving that it is not limited merely to transporting cargoes: Greek shipowners are shaping new trade routes and influencing developments in international energy markets. Two recent examples confirm this strategic primacy. First  the Greek-owned suezmax Gloria Maris marked a historic moment by carrying out the first direct seaborne shipment of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States after a multi-year period of sanctions and restricted flows. With a cargo of 1 million barrels of crude destined for the largest offshore oil import terminal in the U.S.  LOOP in Louisiana  the vessel highlights the ability of Greek interests to capitalize on political and commercial opportunities where others remain hesitant. At the same time  the Greek-owned aframax Nissos Serifos became the first vessel to load Kazakh crude from the refurbished SPM-3 at the CPC terminal near Novorossiysk in the Black Sea  following the repair of damage caused by attacks. In a region where geopolitical tension and military uncertainty directly affect energy flows  the presence of Greek interests ensures stability and consistency in supply  demonstrating that Greek shipping operates not only as a transporter but as a strategic factor in energy security. The common denominator in both cases is the ability of Greek shipowners to move swiftly  leverage international partnerships  and create trade routes where the global market often hesitates.ATHEX: Low Bar Set for the DividendATHEX will announce its results on February 18  at a critical juncture marking the end of an era. Optimists are expecting the last large dividend of the outgoing management  the swan song before the Athens Stock Exchange is fully integrated into the Euronext ecosystem. The optimists will likely be disappointed. ATHEX’s revenues will be the best of the past decade; however  the investments required for modernization and a change of operating model will keep the dividend bar low  with the ex-dividend date set for February 23.Alpha Bank Broke the €10 Billion “Barrier”Alpha Bank is moving in the “orbit” of JP Morgan. The news that the largest U.S. banking group now controls a potential 7.25% stake in the Greek bank constitutes a resounding vote of confidence. The fact that the Americans chose to “build” such a complex position  with call and put options extending to 2028  shows that they view Alpha Bank as a long-term industrial play rather than a “firework.” The rally triggered by JP Morgan’s entry dovetailed perfectly with the bank’s new market issuance. Bids for the senior preferred bond exceeded €3.5 billion  with Alpha Bank raising €750 million—meaning the issue was oversubscribed by approximately 4.66 times. On the trading floor  Alpha gained 2.3% yesterday  following Monday’s jump of 6.2%  reaching €4.40 and a new high of more than ten years. The next target is €5  a level last seen in early November 2015. At the same time  the bank’s market capitalization broke the €10 billion threshold  entering the club of eleven-digit valuations alongside Coca-Cola HBC  Eurobank  National Bank  and Piraeus Bank.GEK TERNA–Motor Oil: In the Antechamber of MSCI Greece with New Historic RecordsThe investment community is focusing on the upcoming MSCI index review on February 10  with attention centered on GEK TERNA and Motor Oil. The two groups are considered the leading candidates for inclusion in the MSCI Greece Standard index  a development that could increase Greek representation from eight to ten stocks  strengthening the weight of the Athens Stock Exchange in international markets. This expectation is already acting as a catalyst for the outperformance of both shares  as index inclusion entails significant capital inflows from institutional portfolios and passive funds during the rebalancing to be completed on February 27. MSCI’s criteria  relating to free float and total market capitalization  appear to be met  reflecting the growth of the two groups over the past year. This move takes on additional significance in the context of preparations for upgrading the Athens Stock Exchange to developed market status. Moreover  both stocks are trading at historic highs  with GEK TERNA now above €34 and Motor Oil above €35. They are also heading toward a €4 billion market capitalization  with MOH currently valued at €3.88 billion and GEK at €3.53 billion. A Mediobanca report provided fresh fuel for the stock  raising the target price to €45.70  mainly due to the signing of the Egnatia Odos concession  the launch of the Northern Crete Motorway (VOAK)  and the addition of new projects. The Italian bank estimates that the true value of the concessions portfolio has not yet been fully priced in. Mediobanca sees strong growth momentum at GEK TERNA due to its vertically integrated concessions-and-construction model and its large portfolio of long-term projects.“Hellenic Ammunition” — Now Also by LawOn Monday  February 2  the establishment of the new company “Hellenic Ammunition S.A.” was officially completed. It is a joint venture between the state-owned Hellenic Defense Systems S.A. (EAS/HDS) and the Czech group Czechoslovak Group (CSG)  via its subsidiary MSM Greece. This strategic partnership represents a significant step toward reviving ammunition production in Lavrio.

The company’s registered office is located in the… Greek state itself  specifically in Ilioupoli  and its purpose includes just about everything one can imagine. The primary objective is the exercise of all kinds of construction  commercial  industrial  agricultural  transport  financial  and business activities in Greece and abroad. Beyond that  it ranges from building construction works and the purchase  sale  and management of real estate to the exploitation of photovoltaic systems. The initial share capital amounts to €100 000  divided into 10 000 shares with a nominal value of €10 each  and was subscribed—as stated—by the company’s founder  Kemal Atzar  a businessman born in 1961 in Dinar  Turkey  and residing in Smyrna (Izmir). He also assumed the role of the company’s first managing director.A Pale Rally in the Indian Stock Market After the Trade Deal with the U.S.The Indian stock market was enthusiastic yesterday  with the BSE Sensex closing at 83 739 points (+2 072 points  +2.54%) and the NSE Nifty reaching 25 727 points (+2.55%). The trigger was a post by President Trump announcing that a trade deal had been concluded reducing tariffs on Indian products from 25% to 18%. At one point  the Sensex touched 85 871 points with gains of +5.1%  while the Nifty reached 26 341 points—one of the strongest single-day performances of recent years. However  the agreement reveals much more than the brokers’ surface optimism. Trump presented as an achievement the commitment of Indian Prime Minister Modi to stop purchases of Russian oil and to buy more than $500 billion worth of American products. India  however  officially confirmed neither claim; Modi merely referred to tariff reductions  without specific quantitative commitments. The agreement comes one week after the conclusion of India’s trade agreement with the European Union  which puts pressure on Washington. Large private Indian refineries had already begun reducing purchases of Russian oil in January  with forecasts for a drop to 1 million barrels per day in February and 800 000 in March. Obviously  the U.S. President will need to ratify the binding trade agreements he announced  with the approval of Congress. For now  everyone is pleased to hear about the reduction of tariffs from the initially imposed high of 50%. India secured better terms than Pakistan (19%)  Vietnam  and Bangladesh (20%) and has reason to feel that it is positioning itself at the center of U.S. strategy vis-à-vis China. The question is whether the agreement will move beyond the stage of a “framework agreement” and ultimately be transformed into a binding text.,neutral,0.01,0.69,0.31,mixed,0.24,0.18,0.58,True,English,"['poison” poll', 'M.M.', 'Romanian billionaires', 'Karystianou', 'Tsipras', 'Thymios', 'Frangou', 'Argentina', 'Praktiker', 'Greece–U.S. strategic dialogue', 'Greece–France defense agreement', 'bilateral defense cooperation agreement', 'Mitsotakis–Erdoğan meeting', 'War Pete Hegseth', 'two new players', 'same polling company', 'current diplomatic adviser', 'legendary Thymios Lymperopoulos', 'toxic” hypothetical question', 'President Maria K.', 'M.M.
