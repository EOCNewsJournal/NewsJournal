The term “shipments” describes the volume of vehicles delivered to dealers  distributors  or directly from the Company to retail and fleet customers  which drive revenue recognition.Consolidated shipments for the three months ending December 31  2025  were an estimated 1.5 million units  a 9% increase y-o-y. This increase was primarily driven by North America and further supported by year‑over‑year shipment growth in South America and in the Middle East & Africa. This was partially offset by a decline in Enlarged Europe due to a combination of a contracting LCV market and competitive pressures.In North America  Q4 shipments grew by approximately 127 thousand units compared to the same period in 2024  representing a 43% y-o-y increase. This significant improvement reflects the benefits of normalized inventory dynamics  in comparison to the prior year’s inventory reduction initiative  as well as increased momentum in the region with Q4 ’25 orders up nearly 150% y-o-y  driven largely by new and refreshed offerings from Jeep ®   Ram and Dodge brands. Shipments of the refreshed Jeep ® Grand Cherokee and Ram LD HEMI® V8 accounted for over 30% of y-o-y growth  partially offset by a decrease in PHEV shipments.  Ram and Dodge brands. Shipments of the refreshed Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram LD HEMI® V8 accounted for over 30% of y-o-y growth  partially offset by a decrease in PHEV shipments. Enlarged Europe reported a decrease of approximately 26 thousand units  or 4% y-o-y. PC and LCV shipments each contracted. Increased shipments of the four Smart Car platform nameplates (Citroën C3  C3 Aircross  Opel Frontera  Fiat Grande Panda)  rose 61 thousand additional units  or 127% y-o-y  due to progress rolling out each of the products  in an expanding range of BEV  MHEV  and ICE powertrain variants. This was not sufficient to reverse an overall drop of 21 thousand units in PCs  or 4% y-o-y  primarily driven by Peugeot  whose shipments were down approximately 30 thousand units  due to declining volumes of Peugeot 208 and of Peugeot 308  ahead of its recent MCA. In addition  LCV volumes were down by 5 thousand units  or 3% y-o-y  against a market context of 7% y-o-y industry volume decline.Across Stellantis’ other regions  shipments grew 24 thousand units net in aggregate  representing a 6% increase y-o-y  mainly driven by an 18 thousand units increase in South America (+7% y-o-y)  and an increase of three thousand units each in both Middle East & Africa (+2% y-o-y) as well as China  India & Asia Pacific (+20% y-o-y). Stellantis maintained its leadership in South America  with a 7% increase y-o-y supported by solid demand in Brazil. Growth in the Middle East & Africa was primarily driven by positive developments in Türkiye  and to a lesser extent  by both the ramp‑up of local production in Algeria  and continued growth in Morocco.NOTES(1) Consolidated shipments only include shipments by Company’s consolidated subsidiaries  which represent new vehicles invoiced to third party (dealers/importers or final customers). Consolidated shipment volumes for Q4 2025 presented here are unaudited and may be adjusted.(2) Middle East & Africa exclude Iran  Sudan and Syria. From 2025  this excludes Israel and Palestine (prior periods have not been restated). Enlarged Europe: From 2025  this includes Israel and Palestine (prior periods have not been restated).# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

What we had previously anticipated to be only a temporary situation proved over the past year to be a longer-term challenge for us operating in rental housing. Intense competition for good residents continued in all of SATO’s market areas.Considering the circumstances  we succeeded well over the year. Our economic occupancy rate was 95.4% (95.5) and the average monthly rent of SATOhomes rose to EUR 18.48 (18.40). Our operating profit increased to EUR 188.4 million (185.6). The fair value of our investment properties increased to EUR 5 237.4 million (4 971.4).We have strengthened SATO’s profitability through consistent  long-term efforts focused on core processes. This enabled an investment in nearly 1 000 homes made in July. We acquired 16 properties  which are of high quality and in line with our targets in terms of energy class from the OP-Rental Yield Fund. The acquisition increased the total number of SATOhomes to approximately 27 000.There was no new SATO properties completed during the year under review  and there are no newbuilds currently under construction. We have  however  continued the development of our plot reserves in all of our operating areas so that  once permitted by the market situation  we will also be able to launch newbuild production and construct rental homes for the needs of growing and internationalising growth centres. Until then  we are exploring further opportunities for profitable growth and focusing on maintaining our existing housing stock and improving its energy efficiency. Last year’s most significant energy investments took place in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. We switched to geothermal heat at five properties and installed solar power systems for 60 SATO buildings.In early 2025  we opened the SATO webshop for rental homes and scaled it up over the year. At year-end  one in ten of SATOhomes was already being rented through the online shop. Our investments in round-the-clock self-service have received a great welcome. It is important for us and our residents that  also when renting a home through the webshop  a future resident will encounter a professional SATO staff member in person as part of the renting process.In 2025  we celebrated SATO’s 85th anniversary. As a stable  responsible and long-serving operator in our sector  we are looking to the future with confidence: there will be demand for rental homes in growth centres with good transport links and close to services going forward  too.My warmest thanks go to SATO staff members  our partners and our customers living in SATOhomes for their excellent cooperation.Antti Aarnio  President and CEOKey figures2025 2024 Total number of apartments  units 26 786 25 849 Investment properties  EUR million 5 237.4 4 971.4 Housing investments  EUR million 239.8 48.6 Apartments under construction  units 0 0 Purchased apartments  units 968 33 Average rent of rental apartments  €/m2/month 18.48 18.40 Cash earnings (CE)  EUR million 91.8 88.2 Equity  EUR million 2 685.2 2 599.8 Personnel at the end of the year 314 300OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence and purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  maintenance costs  and the competitive situation and interest rate level.Despite expectations  the Finnish economy did not take an upward turn in 2025. Uncertainties relating to trade policy and the weak employment situation have maintained consumer caution. Uncertainty is also increased by the challenging security situation. According to the December forecast of the Bank of Finland  growth in 2025 is likely to be just 0.2%. In 2026  growth will accelerate to 0.8% and in 2027 to 1.7%. In the final year of the forecast period in 2028  growth will level out at 1.5%.Private consumption has been curbed by low consumer confidence in the economy  but consumption is expected to perk up and take an upturn in 2026  when real earnings growth of wage and salary earners gathers pace and the labour market strengthens. Consumption growth is projected to strengthen further in 2027–2028. According to the Bank of Finland forecast  investments will grow thanks to factors including green investments. Housing construction will  however  remain subdued in the immediate years ahead. The difficult market situation holds back newbuild housing construction  but this will be eased gradually once consumer incomes and confidence grow.The Finnish economy will continue its slow recovery. Households are regaining a balance in their finances  and consumption will begin to grow. Exports and investments will also be gradually revived. Once economic growth steps up  employment will also be boosted. The weak employment situation is anticipated to improve slightly during 2026.Construction of newbuild homes remains at a low level. Largely due to an increase in the volume of interest-subsidised housing construction  there has  however  been a slight upturn in projects started. At year-end  there were still around 4 500 apartments intended for rental housing under construction in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The number of apartments completed contracted clearly in 2025  but the newbuild construction volume of previous years  which exceeds the long-term housing demand  is maintaining an oversupply of rental homes in the growth centres. The shrinking of the oversupply has been slower than anticipated  and competition for good tenants continues.Dense urban housing is still becoming increasingly popular  and there is demand for rental homes in growth centres with access to good public transport links and close to services. The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  Tampere and Turku.Urbanisation  the income development of wage and salary earners  pent-up housing demand of households and the decrease in new housing construction will increase housing demand going forward. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. The flexibility and convenience of rental housing also make it more attractive as an option for those who have previously opted for home ownership.With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.In line with its majority shareholder Balder Finska Otas AB’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2026 earnings.

(“Stellantis” or “the Company”) today announced that as part of the reset of its business and as it prepares for the communication of its new strategic plan in May of this year  it has conducted a thorough assessment of its strategy and related costs required to align the Company with the real-world preferences of its customers.Over the past five years Stellantis has become a leader in electric vehicles and will continue to be at the forefront of their development. That journey continues at a pace that needs to be governed by demand rather than command. Stellantis is committed to being a beacon for freedom of choice  including for those customers whose lifestyles and working requirements make the Company’s growing range of hybrid and advanced internal combustion engine vehicles the right solution for them.Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa commented: “The reset we have announced today is part of the decisive process we started in 2025  to once again make our customers and their preferences our guiding star. The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers’ real-world needs  means and desires. They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution  the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our newteam”He added: “We have gone deep into every corner of our business and are making the necessary changes  mobilizing all the passion and ingenuity we have within Stellantis. The positive customer reception to our product actions in 2025 resulted in increased orders and a return to top-line growth. In 2026  our unwavering focus is on closing past execution gaps to add further momentum to these early signs of renewed growth. We look forward to sharing the full details of our new strategy at our Investor Day on May 21.”Initial actions taken in 2025 to reset Stellantis and catalyze growth include:The announcement of the largest investment in Stellantis’ U.S. history:$13 billion of investment over the next 4 years to drive growth in the U.S.Introducing 5 new vehicles and initiating 19 other product actions Adding more than 5 000 jobs and increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity utilizationLaunching 10 all-new products in 2025  and expanding powertrain choices  including:Returning the iconic HEMI ® V-8 to the Ram 1500Returning the Jeep ® Cherokee and introducing the next generation Jeep ® Compass Introducing the Dodge Charger SIXPACK two-door Introducing the Fiat Grande Panda and Fiat 500 Hybrid Introducing the Citroën C3 Aircross and C5 AircrossThe cancellation of products that will be unable to achieve profitable scale  including the previously planned Ram 1500 BEV  recognizing both the need to align with customer demand and the changes to U.S. regulatory frameworks.A thorough reorganization of the Company’s global manufacturing and quality management processes. In this context  the Company hired over 2 000 engineers during 2025  mainly in North America.Decisive organizational changes made include the re-empowerment of regional teams  freeing them to make decisions based on their direct knowledge of the preferences of the customers they serve. The Company has also moved to create a more cost-efficient supply chain to support the long-term development of Stellantis’ electrified vehicle programs. The important product actions taken during 2025  which continue to roll out in 2026  and the disciplined allocation of capital to support these  reflect the new team’s determination to drive profitable growth.Early Benefits of Actions Taken in 2025The effectiveness of these initial measures is evidenced by Stellantis’ return to positive volume growth. H2 2025 Consolidated Shipment volume of 2.8 million units increased by 277 thousand  or +11% year-over-year. North America contributed most strongly to the growth (+39%)  benefiting from both improved inventory management and higher sales  while Enlarged Europe  South America  Middle East & Africa  and China and India & Asia Pacific each also contributed year-over-year volume gains.Market share in the U.S. at 7.9% for H2 2025 was 60 basis points higher sequentially. In Enlarged Europe  Stellantis retained its overall #2 market share position and was also the leader in the all-hybrids segment  in the passenger car B-segment and in the LCV market. Customer order intake in Enlarged Europe increased throughout the year  with notable acceleration in H2 2025 (+13% y-o-y) with Q4 2025 orders up 23% y-o-y.The renewed focus  improved methods and enlarged engineering staff committed to quality management are already seeing encouraging early results. For example  the number of issues reported for vehicles in their first month of service decreased over 50% in North America  and over 30% in Enlarged Europe since the beginning of 2025.This reset of Stellantis’ business resulted in charges of approximately €22.2 billion  excluded from AOI  for the second half of 2025  including cash payments of approximately €6.5 billion  which are expected to be paid over the next four years.1. €14.7 billion related to re-aligning product plans with customer preferences and new emission regulations in the U.S.  largely reflecting significantly reduced expectations for BEV products:Includes write-offs related to cancelled products of €2.9 billion and impairment of platforms of €6.0 billion  primarily due to significantly reduced volume and profitability expectations.Includes approximately €5.8 billion in projected cash payments over the next four years  relating to both cancelled products as well as other ongoing BEV products whose volumes are now expected to be considerably below prior projections.2. €2.1 billion related to the resizing of the EV supply chain:€2.1 billion of charges  including a total of approximately €0.7 billion in cash payments expected to be paid over the next four years  related to steps of rationalizing battery manufacturing capacity.3. €5.4 billion related to other changes in the Company’s operations:€4.1 billion due to a change in estimate for contractual warranty provision  resulting from the reassessment of the estimation process  taking into account recent increases in cost inflation and a deterioration in quality  as a result of operational choices  which did not deliver the expected quality performance  now being reversed by the new management team.€1.3 billion of other charges  including restructuring primarily related to already communicated workforce reductions in Enlarged Europe.The Company has taken the vast majority of decisions required to correct direction  particularly related to aligning our product plans and portfolio with market demand  which are reflected in the amounts accrued.Preliminary financial information for the Second Half 2025(1): Second half 2025 Net revenues and Industrial free cash flows improved compared to the first half of 2025  consistent with the Company’s latest financial guidance. However  results were negatively impacted by specific items  including the change in estimate for contractual warranties  and other items  resulting in AOI margin for the second half of 2025 finishing below the guided low-single digit range.Financial Information (Preliminary and Unaudited)Second Half 2025 Estimate (€B) Net revenues €78 - €80 Net loss (€19) - (€21) Adjusted operating income(3) (€1.2) - (€1.5) Cash flows from operating activities (€2.3) - (€2.5) Industrial free cash flows(4) (€1.4) - (€1.6)Dividend suspended  hybrid bonds issuance authorized.In recognition of the Company’s Net loss for the full-year 2025 the Company will not pay an annual dividend in 2026.In addition  the Board of Directors of Stellantis N.V. authorized the issuance of non-convertible subordinated perpetual hybrid bonds  up to a maximum amount of €5 billion.These actions will contribute to preserving a strong balance sheet and liquidity position  while the Company works to return the business to positive industrial free cash flow generation.Industrial available liquidity ended 2025 at approximately €46 billion  representing a 30% ratio compared to 2025 Net revenues  at the upper-end of the Company’s targeted 25-30% ratio to Net revenue.Initiating Preliminary 2026 Financial Guidance. In spite of the challenging industry context  in particular ongoing regulatory uncertainties in Enlarged Europe  the Company’s progress in improving its product portfolio and industrial execution puts it in the position to continue a gradual sequential improvement in its principal KPIs.The Company expects to improve each of Net revenues  AOI margin(3) and cash generation in 2026  and during the 2026 financial year  to see improvement in these measures from the first half to the second half.2026 Financial Guidance Net revenues Mid-Single Digit % Increase Adj. operating income(3) margin Low-Single Digit %Includes Projected €1.6B in net tariff expenses (€1.2B in 2025) Industrial free cash flows(4) Improved Y-o-YIncludes (€2B) in 2026 payments related to H2 '25 chargesExpect Positive IFCF in 2027Management Conference Call:Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and CFO Joao Laranjo will host a conference call to discuss the preliminary financial figures for Second Half 2025  and answer analyst questions.Time: Friday  February 6th  at 8:00 a.m. EST / 2:00 p.m. CETLink: Available on the Investors section of the Company’s website (www.stellantis.com)Full year 2025 financial results will be released as scheduled on February 26  2026.NOTES(1) Final figures will be provided in our H2 2025 Results.

Unusual operating income/(expense) includes  but may not be limited to: impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis' core operations; facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis' plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand  and convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.(3) Adjusted Operating Income/(Loss) Margin is calculated as Adjusted operating income/(loss) divided by Net revenues.(4) Industrial Free Cash Flows is our key cash flow metric and is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less: (i) cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; (ii) cash flows from operating activities related to financial services  net of eliminations; (iii) investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities  (iv) contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments; and adjusted for: (i) net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations; (ii) proceeds from disposal of assets and (iii) contributions to defined benefit pension plans  net of tax. The timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables  factoring and the payment of accounts payables  as well as changes in other components of working capital  which can vary from period to period due to  among other things  cash management initiatives and other factors  some of which may be outside of the Company’s control. In addition Industrial free cash flows is one of the metrics used in the determination of the annual performance for eligible employees  including members of the Senior Management.(5) Industrial available liquidity is calculated as total cash  cash equivalents and financial securities plus undrawn committed credit lines available to Industrial activities.
