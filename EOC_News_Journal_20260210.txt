54918,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://cointelegraph.com/news/canton-yuval-rooz-empty-shell-models?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,Canton’s Yuval Rooz says crypto is finally repricing ‘empty shell’ models,Digital Asset cofounder and CEO Yuval Rooz said the latest crypto sell‑off is repricing “empty shell” token models and pushing institutions to chains with value  privacy and predictability.,The cryptocurrency market sell‑off is forcing a reckoning in the industry to reward blockchains with real business models  where value flows to token holders and users rather than intermediaries or speculative order flow  according to Yuval Rooz.Rooz is the co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset  creator of the institutional‑grade  privacy‑enabled Canton Network. In an exclusive interview  he told Cointelegraph that he’s not worried about the state of the crypto market  and the turbulence hasn’t scared off his core customer base.He pointed to Canton Network and derivatives exchange Hyperliquid as examples of what investors are gravitating toward.Canton Network’s cryptocurrency rose 25% in the past month  while Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged 28%  according to CoinGecko.“What people start to understand is that all of the crypto narratives have been empty shells ” said Rooz.Yuval Rooz  Digital Asset cofounder and CEO. Source: Digital AssetBridges  fees and anonymity coinsArchitecture and token design are the differentiators for institutions  Rooz claimed. For public chains  the architecture they rely on to connect to other networks is bridges.“Bridges inherently are not interoperability ” he said.Bridges move assets from one blockchain to another by locking them on their origin and releasing equivalent-value tokens on the destination network. As the assets remain locked in a contract  they are often targeted by hackers.The growing reliance on bridges has also drawn regulatory scrutiny  not just because of their security vulnerabilities but for their role in obscuring transaction flows.Related: Temple Digital Group launches 24/7 institutional trading built on CantonBlockchain security company Elliptic estimated that at least $21.8 billion in illicit or high‑risk crypto flowed through decentralized exchanges  cross‑chain bridges and swap services in 2025.Such infrastructure is increasingly viewed by regulators as a source of systemic risk  particularly when combined with privacy tools that limit traceability. Regulators have also grown more uncomfortable with what Rooz described as “anonymity coins.”Rooz said that institutional clients like Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Euroclear need privacy  interoperability without bridges and predictable costs  arguing that general‑purpose public chains can’t offer all three.Public chains hosting institutional productsDespite Rooz’s claims  several large asset managers are already issuing tokenized products on Ethereum (ETH) and other general‑purpose public networks.BlackRock’s first tokenized fund  the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)  launched on Ethereum in 2024 and has since been integrated with additional networks.Franklin Templeton has likewise tokenized a US government money fund on the public Polygon and Stellar blockchains  with BENJI tokens representing beneficial interests in the fund.Banks are also experimenting with public chain rails alongside permissioned stacks  rather than treating them as mutually exclusive  with JPMorgan deploying JPM Coin on Coinbase’s Base network for institutional clients in November 2025  and announcing plans to bring USD JPM Coin (JPMD) natively to the Canton Network in 2026.“They’re bringing stablecoins to Canton and we’re very excited about it ” Rooz said  adding that clients were starting to take a view on stablecoins “kind of like collateral ” assessing which has more or less risk before deciding on their preferred payment method  from USDC (USDC) to Tether’s USDt (USDT)  JPM Coin or other bank stablecoins.Magazine: Meet the onchain crypto detectives fighting crime better than the cops,neutral,0.04,0.87,0.09,mixed,0.17,0.29,0.54,True,English,"['empty shell’ models', 'Yuval Rooz', 'Canton', 'crypto', 'institutional‑grade, privacy‑enabled Canton Network', 'USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund', 'other general‑purpose public networks', 'US government money fund', 'several large asset managers', 'general‑purpose public chains', 'cryptocurrency market sell‑off', '24/7 institutional trading', 'Digital Asset cofounder', 'Temple Digital Group', 'real business models', 'speculative order flow', 'public chain rails', 'preferred payment method', 'first tokenized fund', 'USD JPM Coin', 'core customer base', 'Blockchain security company', 'other bank stablecoins', 'Digital Asset Bridges', 'high‑risk crypto', 'cross‑chain bridges', 'other networks', 'institutional products', 'crypto market', 'Base network', 'privacy tools', 'institutional clients', 'additional networks', 'public Polygon', 'destination network', 'one blockchain', 'security vulnerabilities', 'tokenized products', 'systemic risk', 'less risk', 'crypto narratives', 'crypto detectives', 'token holders', 'exclusive interview', 'derivatives exchange', 'past month', 'empty shells', 'anonymity coins', 'token design', 'equivalent-value tokens', 'growing reliance', 'regulatory scrutiny', 'transaction flows', 'decentralized exchanges', 'swap services', 'Such infrastructure', 'Depository Trust', 'Clearing Corporation', 'predictable costs', 'Franklin Templeton', 'BENJI tokens', 'beneficial interests', 'permissioned stacks', 'Stellar blockchains', 'Yuval Rooz', 'reckoning', 'industry', 'users', 'intermediaries', 'CEO', 'creator', 'Cointelegraph', 'state', 'turbulence', 'examples', 'investors', 'Hyperliquid', 'CoinGecko', 'people', 'Source', 'fees', 'Architecture', 'differentiators', 'institutions', 'interoperability', 'assets', 'origin', 'contract', 'hackers', 'role', 'Elliptic', 'illicit', 'regulators', 'traceability', 'Euroclear', 'claims', 'Ethereum', 'BlackRock', 'BUIDL', 'Banks', 'JPMorgan', 'Coinbase', 'November', 'plans', 'JPMD', 'collateral', 'USDC', 'Tether', 'USDt', 'Magazine', 'onchain', 'crime', 'cops']",2026-02-09,2026-02-10,cointelegraph.com

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN® Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

For the first time  the prestigious event—attended annually since 1963 by leading politicians  military representatives  business leaders and non-governmental organisations—will be partnered by the industrial and technology group CSG. CSG’s active support of the conference confirms both the Group’s growing importance at the European and global level  further strengthened by its January listing on Euronext Amsterdam  as well as the expansion of CSG’s business activities on the German market.The Czech Republic will be represented at the Munich Security Conference by President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel  and the invitation has also been extended to Foreign Minister Petr Macinka. The participation of dozens of heads of state  heads of government and leaders of international organisations has been confirmed.

The transaction was completed last year  and the company was renamed MSM Walsrode. CSG plans to introduce the production of energetic nitrocellulose  a key component for ammunition manufacturing  at this facility. Last year  CSG also acquired a 9.2% stake in the publicly listed company Alzchem Group AG  which is likewise active in the chemical industry.“CSG is considering further expansion of its large-calibre ammunition and ammunition components production capacities in Germany  linked to the planned production of energetic nitrocellulose in Walsrode ” says Jaroslav Strnad Jr.  CEO of MSM Group  which oversees ammunition production within CSG. He adds: “Production of energetic nitrocellulose at MSM Walsrode is expected to begin in the course of 2026. We are currently completing the preparation for the construction of a new building where the production will take place.”Following its successful IPO on Euronext Amsterdam on 23 January  CSG’s importance on the international stage has increased further.

The company intends to prioritize the development and regulatory advancement of its lead biofungicide assets and focus commercial preparation efforts on markets with the highest near-term potential. The intended initiative is expected to result in an estimated reduction in total cash burn until the end of 2028 of €20m versus the current operating structure.“It is imperative that we deploy capital where it creates the greatest impact ” said Kevin Helash  CEO of Biotalys. “A narrowing of the focus to our core assets and most advanced programs aims to strengthen our ability to deliver innovative  sustainable crop protection solutions to growers and  subject to securing additional funding  to advance our path to long-term value creation.”The intended strategic transition will focus resources on progressing Biotalys’ most advanced biofungicide programs – EVOCA NG and BioFun-6 – while continuing to support the partnered BioFun-7 program with the Gates Foundation as well as BioIns-2  the company’s insecticide program in partnership with Syngenta. Biotalys will continue process development to achieve commercially competitive manufacturing costs  supported by its recently announced strategic partnership with 21st.BIO. Biotalys will also continue its partnership for the post-harvest market with AgroFresh. This partnership driven approach and intended heightened focus are aimed at de-risking future commercialization efforts.In this context  Biotalys announced its intention to reduce its workforce by 30 employees to align its cost structure with the intended refocused strategy.1 The company confirms its cash runway into May 2026  as previously announced. Biotalys is in discussion with investors regarding potential financing options  to support the sharpened portfolio. The intended measures should significantly reduce the investment required to deliver on Biotalys’ goal of becoming a pioneer of Precision Biocontrols generating value for its shareholders and stakeholders and growers worldwide.About EVOCAEVOCA helps safely control the fungal diseases Botrytis (grey mold) and powdery mildew for fruit and vegetable growers. EVOCA NG is expected to be Biotalys’ first commercial biofungicide  with a planned launch in the USA in 2029  and in Europe in 2030  targeting a combined market of more than USD 1.1 billion.2On 2 December 2025  Biotalys announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved EVOCA  the company’s first-generation version. An approval of EVOCA paves the way for the regulatory submission of EVOCA NG. The company anticipates a significantly shorter regulatory review process for EVOCA NG  as the product contains the same active ingredient as EVOCA.About BiotalysBiotalys is an Agricultural Technology (AgTech) company developing precision biocontrol solutions based on proteins for the protection of crops in both the pre- and post-harvest markets. The company provides novel solutions that bridge the efficacy and scale of chemistry with the environmental advantages of biological solutions. Based on its novel AGROBODY™ technology platform  Biotalys is developing a strong and diverse pipeline of effective product candidates with a favorable safety profile that aim to address key crop pests and diseases across the whole value chain  from soil to plate.

Skovridergaard  Marienlundsvej 36  DK-8600 SilkeborgAGENDA of general meeting:a. Report of the Supervisory Board on Jyske Bank's operations during the preceding year. b. Presentation of the annual report for adoption or other resolution as well as resolution as to the application of profit or cover of loss according to the financial statements adopted  including the Supervisory Board’s proposal for payment of dividend. c. Presentation of and consultative ballot on the remuneration report. d. Determination of remuneration to the Shareholders’ Representatives and the Supervisory Board: 1 Determination of the remuneration of Shareholders’ Representatives for 2026  cf. Art.15(5) of the Articles of Association. 2 Determination of the remuneration of Supervisory Board members for 2026  cf. Art.16(9) of the Articles of Association. e. Consideration of motion to the effect that the Supervisory Board authorises Jyske Bank to acquire Jyske Bank shares on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting  of up to a nominal amount of DKK 61 506 977 and at amounts not deviating by more than 10% from the closing bid price listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen A/S at the time of acquisition. f. Motions. Motions proposed by the Supervisory Board : 1 Reduction of Jyske Bank's nominal share capital by DKK 33 095 280  or 3 309 528 shares of a nominal value of DKK 10  from DKK 615 069 770 to DKK 581 974 490. With reference to S.188(1) of the Danish Companies Act we point out that the capital reduction takes place through cancellation of previously acquired own shares acquired by Jyske Bank in accordance with authorisation from members in general meeting. Hence  the capital reduction is spent on payment of capital owners.If the motion is adopted  Jyske Bank's holding of own shares will be reduced by 3 309 528 shares of a nominal value of DKK 10.

The agreement was signed during the international defence exhibition World Defense Show 2026 in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia  where the new mining system mounted on a Tatra 6×6 chassis was presented for the first time.The parties to the cooperation agreement are Czechoslovak Group a.s. (CSG)  Czechoslovak Group Polska Sp. z o.o. (CSG Polska)  and the Polish state-owned company Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa S.A. (PGZ).The agreement concerns commercial and technological cooperation between CSG and PGZ and enables the offering of the modular mining deployment system integrated on Tatra chassis on third-country markets. At the same time  it was agreed that one of the first markets where this solution may be offered is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement between CSG and PGZ is also fully aligned with the Saudi government’s policy on production localisation and its “Vision 2030” programme  which will allow partial production of the solution through a domestic licensed manufacturer of Tatra chassis operating in Saudi Arabia.Another potential sales direction is a European NATO member state  while the agreement also allows for the expansion of cooperation to additional markets. This applies in particular  though not exclusively  to countries whose armed forces already operate vehicles based on Tatra chassis.“The agreement that has just been signed represents another stage in the cooperation between CSG and PGZ. In this case  the cooperation has a project-based character and concerns a specific solution. We believe that the modular mining deployment system mounted on a Tatra chassis will attract strong market interest. Many countries are currently seeking modern solutions in this category. Our main strengths are the high quality of the product  flexibility in contract execution options  and extensive experience in delivering complex defence projects  including technology transfer ” said Wojciech Grzonka  Chairman of the Board of CSG Polska.“This is also another example of the synergies arising from cooperation between CSG and PGZ. We will actively seek new potential export markets for this solution and at the same time anticipate expanding cooperation with the Polish defence industry group PGZ and its subsidiaries into additional product areas ” he added.“PGZ sees the business and industrial cooperation with Czechoslovak Group (CSG) as mutually beneficial. PGZ is the manufacturer of one of the most advanced modular scatterable mining systems in the world  that is already being delivered to the Polish Armed Forces  CSG on the other hand is a globally recognized defence conglomerate and the supplier of reliable all-terrain chassis under Tatra-brand. Mutual cooperation between two experienced manufacturers expands the opportunities to offer the Modular Mine Laying System to completely new foreign customers. I am convinced that this is only the beginning of extensive joint efforts aimed at the expanding the export markets for both companies ” said Marcin Idzik  Vice Chairman of the Management Board of PGZ S.A.The Modular Mine Laying System is a modern mining solution developed and manufactured by Bydgoskie Zakłady Elektromechaniczne “Belma” S.A.  a company that is part of the PGZ Group. The system features full automation of the deployment of mine barriers of varying sizes  mining densities and selectable self-destruction times. The depth of the minefield ranges from 60 to 180 metres  with a length of up to 1 800 metres. Belma is also the manufacturer of the MN-123 mines used in this system.The Modular Mine Laying System (MMLS) is a brand new PGZ solution that allows for endless customization according to customer requirements and needs. The launcher modules can be fitted in any number and configuration on both wheeled and tracked chassis  as well as unmanned platforms. The Modular Mine Laying System  known in Poland as PMN Baobab‑K (mounted on a all-terrain 8x8 chassis)  is covered by a procurement contract concluded with the Ministry of Defence in 2023. In December 2025  the Polish Armament Agency and Huta Stalowa Wola S.A. (part of the PGZ Group) signed another contract for the delivery of a tracked version of the mine‑laying system  the TMN Baobab‑G.About CSGCSG N.V.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a designation as breakthrough therapy to Wayrilz (rilzabrutinib)  a novel oral  reversible Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  for the treatment of patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA)  a rare autoimmune disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells. The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare has also provided rilzabrutinib an orphan designation for the same condition.Both designations are based on clinical data from the ongoing LUMINA 2 phase 2b study (clinical study identifier: NCT05002777 ) assessing the efficacy and safety of rilzabrutinib for patients with wAIHA. In addition  the new LUMINA 3 phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT07086976 )  is assessing rilzabrutinib compared with placebo in patients with wAIHA. There is currently no approved treatment that specifically targets the underlying cause of this rare autoimmune condition  which can lead to anemia  fatigue  and serious organ damage.An FDA breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines in the US intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over available treatment options. Orphan designation in Japan is granted to medicines intended to address rare diseases with high unmet medical need.“These recognitions highlight the critical unmet need that persists for people living with wAIHA ” said Karin Knobe  Global Head of Development  Rare Diseases. “Furthermore  receiving such designations reinforces our commitment to advancing innovative medicines for rare diseases that currently have limited or no approved treatment options.”Rilzabrutinib is approved in the US  the EU  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under the brand name Wayrilz for the treatment of adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and is currently under regulatory review for ITP in Japan. Other than the approved ITP indications in the US  EU  and UAE  these uses of rilzabrutinib are investigational and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.The FDA previously granted rilzabrutinib orphan drug designation for autoimmune hemolytic anemia  as well as two other rare diseases  IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Rilzabrutinib also received FDA fast track designation for ITP and IgG4-RD and EU orphan designation in ITP  autoimmune hemolytic anemia  and IgG4-RD.About wAIHAwAIHA is a rare  potentially life-threatening  autoimmune disorder rooted in complex immune system dysregulation. It represents more than half of autoimmune hemolytic anemia cases. In wAIHA  autoantibodies lead to the premature destruction of the body’s own red blood cells (hemolysis)  sometimes faster than the bone marrow can replace them. In the US and EU  autoimmune hemolytic anemia is estimated to affect four to 24 people out of 100 000  while in Japan it is rarer  affecting three to 10 people per million. People living with wAIHA may experience debilitating fatigue  dizziness  palpitations  and shortness of breath  and may face complications such as thromboembolism.About rilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib  Wayrilz where approved  is a novel  oral  reversible covalent BTK inhibitor that has the potential to be an effective new medicine for several rare immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases by working to restore immune balance via multi-immune modulation. BTK  expressed in B cells  macrophages  and other innate immune cells  plays a critical role in multiple immune-mediated disease processes and inflammatory pathways. With the application of the TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target. Wayrilz is now approved for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the US  the EU  and the UAE. Regulatory review for use in ITP is currently ongoing in Japan.In addition to ITP and wAIHA  rilzabrutinib is being studied across a variety of rare diseases  including IgG4-RD and SCD. These additional indications are currently under investigation and have not been approved by regulatoryauthorities.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and delivering compelling growth.
