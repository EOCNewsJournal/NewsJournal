Located in the eastern inner ring of the Paris region  the site will be occupied by Rexel  a specialist in the distribution of electrical equipment.Source: ARGANAlready a long-standing tenant at the site  Rexel is strengthening its presence in Roissy-en-Brie by expanding its occupied space by 9 000 sq.m  bringing the total to 27 000 sq.m. This expansion confirms both the attractiveness of the logistics platform and the quality of the partnership established with ARGAN. The additional space will enable Rexel to accommodate within the warehouse one of its subsidiaries specialized in low-current systems.Prior to the arrival of this subsidiary  the Roissy-en-Brie site managed an inventory of approximately 25 000 product references and employed 70 staff members. The integration of this new activity will enrich the logistics platform with an additional 6 000 product references and mobilize 30 full-time equivalents  further strengthening the strategic role of the site within Rexel’s logistics network in the Paris area.A re-letting made possible by ARGAN’s close relationship with its tenant-clientsAs the owner of two warehouses leased to Rexel  ARGAN supports the development of its tenant-client through close monitoring of its key accounts. This transaction forms part of a long-term partnership  already demonstrated at the Cestas site  where ARGAN and Rexel have actively collaborated on the modernization and decarbonization of the heating facilities.As in Cestas  replacing the existing gas boilers with electric heat pumps will drastically reduce the warehouse’s CO₂ emissions in Roissy-en-Brie  with an estimated reduction of nearly 300 tonnes of CO₂  in line with the strong environmental commitments upheld by ARGAN and Rexel.Following this approach  the lighting system has been fully upgraded with a Rexel LED solution equipped with presence detection  while the office spaces have also been modernized  contributing to the overall improvement of the site’s energy performance.ARGAN  a PREMIUM portfolio totalling nearly 4 million square metersRonan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “This reletting illustrates ARGAN’s ability to sustainably support the growth of its tenant-clients and the strength of the long-term relationships we build with our key accounts. It also highlights the attractiveness of our assets in the Greater Paris region. By enabling Rexel to expand its space on a site it already occupies  ARGAN confirms its role as a committed real estate partner  attentive to the operational and environmental needs of its users.”Hugues Farjon  Rexel Real Estate Director: “This extension at the Roissy-en-Brie site is fully in line with our strategy to streamline and modernize our logistics operations. It not only enables us to support the growth of our business activities but also to improve the site’s environmental performance  notably through the replacement of gas boilers with electric heat pumps and the modernization of equipment. We share with ARGAN a common ambition regarding decarbonization and the improvement of working conditions for our employees.”2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 26: General Assembly 2026April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 23: Half-year results 2026October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20262027 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 4: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2026quarter 2026 January 21: Annual results 2026March 25: General Assembly 2027About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing five ordinary shares) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (DBVT – CUSIP: 23306J309).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding the therapeutic potential of VIASKIN® Peanut patch and EPIT  results of DBV’s clinical trials  DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  plans and expectations with respect to the submission of BLAs to FDA  and the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

(ISIN: FR0000074148 - ASY)  an international engineering group  today released its revenue figures for the fourth quarter of 2025 and the twelve months ended 31 December 2025.2025 consolidated revenue (unaudited)and year-on-year changes vs 2024In millions of euros 2024 2025 % change(reported) % change(organic(2)) Group(1) 611.3 656.6 +7.4% +4.5% France 380.9 387.8 +1.8% +1.8% International(1) 230.4 268.8 +16.7% +8.9%(1) Consolidation since 1 January 2025 of the UK company  Mactech Energy Group  specialised in construction capabilities for the nuclear industry.(2) At constant exchange rates and excluding scope effects (acquisitions and disposals).In Q4 2025  Assystem's consolidated revenue came to €172.5 million (compared with €165.9 million in Q4 2024). This represents total growth of 4.0%  including a 2.2% organic increase  a 4.7% positive impact from changes in the scope of consolidation – corresponding entirely to the consolidation of UK-based Mactech Energy Group – and a negative 2.8% currency effect. Revenue growth for nuclear activities was partly offset by a contraction in revenue from non-nuclear activities and reflects particularly challenging base effects.For full year 2025  Assystem's consolidated revenue rose 7.4% on a reported basis to €656.6 million from €611.3 million in 2024. Organic growth was 4.5%  changes in the scope of consolidation had a positive 4.2% impact  and the currency effect was a negative 1.3%.Nuclear activities accounted for 77% of total annual consolidated revenue.Based on the full-year trends for its France and International segments  Assystem now expects EBIT-A margin for 2025 to be slightly higher than in 2024.FRANCE (59% of 2025 consolidated revenue vs 62% in 2024)Revenue in France totalled €387.8 million in 2025  compared with €380.9 million in 2024  representing 1.8% year-on-year growth  which was entirely organic.In 2025  the low level of activity on nuclear reactor new-builds  combined with lower volumes of business from France’s nuclear installed base (due to a basis-of-comparison effect vs the 2024 peak  and the fact that EDF has in-sourced some services) were offset by robust momentum for other nuclear activities.In Q4 2025  Assystem's revenue in France rose by 1.0% to €103.0 million (versus €102.0 million in Q4 2024).INTERNATIONAL (41% of 2025 consolidated revenue vs 38% in 2024)Revenue from International businesses advanced 16.7% to €268.8 million in 2025 from €230.4 million in 2024  with 8.9% organic growth  a positive 11.3% impact from changes in the scope of consolidation (consolidation of Mactech Energy Group from 1 January 2025)  and a negative 3.6% currency effect.In 2025  Assystem continued to broaden its footprint in the United Kingdom  which now represents 25% of total consolidated revenue. Organic growth remained very solid in the UK despite a high basis of comparison with 2024  which was particularly strong in Q4. Assystem was also positively impacted by the continued growth momentum of Mactech  whose integration into the Group has gone smoothly. The International segment's other countries (MECA and India) likewise enjoyed good organic growth trends.In Q4 2025  revenue from International businesses rose by 8.7% to €69.5 million (versus €63.9 million in Q4 2024). Organic growth slowed to 3.9% (due to the high basis of comparison with 2024 in the UK and fewer siting studies in the Middle East)  scope effect had a positive 12.1% impact  and the currency effect was unfavourable for all geographies  representing an overall negative 7.3%.2026 FINANCIAL CALENDARTuesday 10 March: Full-year 2025 results – Results presentation on Wednesday 11 March at 8.30 a.m. (CET)Thursday 23 April: First-quarter 2026 revenue releaseFriday 22 May: Annual General MeetingThursday 23 July: First-half 2026 revenue releaseTuesday 15 September: First-half 2026 results – Presentation meeting on Wednesday 16 September at 8.30 a.m. (CEST)Tuesday 27 October: Third-quarter 2026 revenue releaseABOUT ASSYSTEMAssystem is now ranked among the world’s top three independent nuclear engineering leaders.

The findings come from the latest analysis of the Sidetrade Data Lake  one of the world’s most comprehensive anonymized data repositories focused on payment behavior across the Order-to-Cash cycle. Based on $8 trillion+ in B2B transactions from more than 42 million buying companies  the data shows that contractual payment terms do not determine when companies get paid. What matters instead is how invoices are managed by suppliers.In a volatile macroeconomic environment  B2B payment behavior reveals buyers’ efforts to optimize their working capital  along with the resulting commercial tensions and cash-flow risks that follow.The Sidetrade Data Lake shows 37% of the days-to-pay cycle now happens after the payment due date. This shift increases uncertainty in suppliers’ cash-flow forecasting and raises the stakes in working capital management.Regional Discipline  Not Terms  Explains Who Gets Paid FasterGlobally  businesses took an average of 51 days to get paid in 2025  composed of:32 days of contractual payment terms19 days of payment delayThe data indicates that short commercial payment terms alone do not reliably accelerate cash generation.Country-level disparities are significant:The Netherlands sets a global benchmark at 40 days-to-pay in average   including only 12 days of delay  the lowest worldwide.sets a global benchmark at   including only 12 days of delay  the lowest worldwide. India records an average of 77 day-to-pay  driven by 43 days of delay beyond agreed contract terms.That 37-day gap represents cash exposure for multinational enterprises operating across regions.United States Snapshot: The Impact of Industry Behavior on CompetitivenessA 25-day average delay hides the United States story. On average  Financial Services  Insurance  and Real Estate operate at 57 day-to-pay with 27 days of delay  while Manufacturing and HR Services hold delays at 24 days and pay materially faster (54 days and 49 days respectively).In this context  companies’ ability to convert revenue into cash depends first and foremost on the payment discipline specific to each industry  approval chains  and Order-to-Cash processes. Credit policies  risk segmentation  and accounts receivable management strategies must be grounded in buyers’ actual payment behavior.European Payment Gap Despite RegulationEurope outperforms the United States on payment discipline (18 vs. 29 days of delay)  but EU regulation does not equal consistency. The Netherlands sets the global benchmark with Germany  Sweden  Finland  and the Czech Republic close behind (12 -15 days). Spain and parts of Southern and Eastern Europe lag  by weeks despite operating under similar legal framework.These patterns reinforce that regulation alone does not standardize payment behavior. Control of Order-to-Cash discipline  at both the industry and enterprise levels  remains decisive.Germany averages 15 days of delay; ICT and Transport & Logistics underperform relative to the national baseline.Within France  average payment delay stands at 19 days  but ranges from 17 days in Retail and Transport & Logistics to 24 days in HR Services.The United Kingdom averages 21 days of delay  with Life Sciences and Manufacturing among the slowest.“Late payments are structural and consistently exceed statutory limits. For policymakers  they offer real-time insight into underlying economic pressures ” said Mark Sheldon  CTO at Sidetrade. “For enterprises  payment delays undermine cash forecasting  inflates accounts receivable costs  and weakens balance-sheet confidence. Renegotiating commercial terms treats the symptom. Controlling the Order-to-Cash cycle addresses the cause.”Data First  AI SecondIn large enterprises  customer payment behaviors are spread across ERPs  CRMs  spreadsheets  and manual work  masking the drivers of payment delay. In 2015  Sidetrade recognized that payment signals were fragmented and largely untapped. The company evolved from an Order-to-Cash SaaS vendor to a data-centric  AI-native cash performance platform  backed by sustained investment in proprietary private-cloud infrastructure purpose-built to ingest  normalize  and analyze large-scale financial transaction data with high reliability.“We began by building the data foundation to analyze the Revenue-to-Cash ” said Mark Sheldon  CTO at Sidetrade. “Since 2016  the Sidetrade Data Lake has been used for training our AI models. The continuous accumulation of payment experiences  combined with proprietary infrastructure and models purpose-built for Order-to-Cash  allows our AI to learn from trillions of payment experiences. Other models  trained on broad and/or much smaller datasets  cannot reproduce that level of accuracy and outcomes in terms of financial performance.”Today  the Sidetrade Data Lake aggregates more than $8 trillion in anonymized B2B transactions  forming a continuous  payment behavior-driven dataset that reflects how enterprises pay their suppliers across regions  industries  and economic cycles.Sidetrade’s differentiation is rooted in more than a decade of continuous investment in domain-specific data  combined with the operation of its IT infrastructure and controls over the entire AI lifecycle. From data ingestion to model deployment  the company operates without reliance on third-party MLOps platforms  ensuring long-term technological coherence and sustained operational performance.The Importance of Financial Decision IntelligenceStatic datasets do not learn. The Sidetrade Data Lake continuously captures and standardizes buyer and vendor interactions  creating the foundation required for reliable domain-specific AI at scale. Payment events are streamed in near real time Sidetrade’s AI stack  through a Kafka-based ingestion layer  persisted in a scalable analytical store  and refined through a medallion architecture that progresses data from raw to curated states. Transformations are SQL-driven  versioned  and testable  enabling reproducibility and auditability at scale.This IT architecture allows Sidetrade to maintain consistent historical views of invoices  payments  disputes  and Order-to-Cash actions across regions  and business units. It also provides curated  production-grade feature sets to AI models supporting predictive and prescriptive use cases in collections  dispute management  credit risk  and cash forecasting.“Quality data is the foundation of AI. Without it  there’s no learning and no intelligent Order-to-Cash ” said Mark Sheldon  CTO at Sidetrade.Indeed  Aimie  Sidetrade’s agentic AI  models payment behavioral patterns that remain invisible to static or single-tenant datasets (client-bound datasets). In 2025  the Sidetrade Data Lake captured approximately 285 million invoices representing $1.7 trillion. The result is improved decision-making accross collections prioritization  dispute resolution  credit risk assessment  payment window modeling  and cash forecasting.“The discrepancies we see in the Data Lake are not marginal. They tilt the competitive balance between complex  multi-entity organizations in the same industry  strain trust between suppliers and customers ” Sheldon said. “In 2025  Aimie executed or recommended more than 5.1 million collection actions and supported a 49% increase in cash collection efficiency. This performance reflects a shift away from reactive workflows toward disciplined  AI data-driven operation.”Aimie  Sidetrade’s autonomous decisioning AI engine  applies probabilistic modeling  algorithmic optimization  and natural language processing to interpret payment behavior in context. This includes recurring disputes  approval bottlenecks  and region-specific execution patterns. Unlike generic models that operate on abstract assumptions  Aimie’s decisions are grounded in observed customer behavior inside live financial workflows  including exception-heavy scenarios where traditional automation breaks down. Outcomes are continuously captured and fed back into Sidetrade’s platform  allowing AI models to recalibrate against real payment results rather than static benchmarks.“Autonomous decisioning in finance doesn’t come from a model alone ” Sheldon concluded. “It comes from the scale  structure  and governance of the data behind it. Aimie is trained on anonymized  real-world B2B payment behavior  using Order-to-Cash-specific models  deployed within a governed and private environment. That data foundation is what allows our autonomous agents to prioritize collections  surface disputes  flag emerging risk  and forecast cash with a level of accuracy and operational efficiency that generic AI agents cannot match.”With Sidetrade  enterprises are transitioning from static  rules-based automation to autonomous cash flow decisioning powered by adaptive AI. In volatile markets  where payment behavior shifts rapidly across countries and industries  predefined workflows fail to keep pace. As regional and industry patterns diverge  effective decisions depend on AI systems that learn continuously and act in real time.The Sidetrade Data LakeData Science Analysis42 million+ buyer companies$8 trillion+ worth of invoices1 billion+ invoices processed in the last five yearsMethodologyDaily analysis of the data hosted in the Sidetrade Cloud leveraging machine learning algorithms. While the Sidetrade Data Lake captures payment behavior across 100% of observed volume  specific industry segmentation is derived from the ~33% of invoices with definitive vertical tagging. The remaining ~67% constitutes a ‘General Data Pool’ which informs our global baselines but is excluded from specific industry rankings to ensure statistical purity.As the data is aggregated  payment delays are reported as averages at group level (industries) rather than at invoice level. We therefore first compute the payment delay average weighted by invoice amounts to identify a central reference point. We then measure the share of total invoice amounts associated with average payment delays around this level  which allows us to express the result as a percentage without over-interpreting the data.Reference Period1-Jan-2021 through 01-Jan-2026Sidetrade Data Lake’s SovereigntySidetrade’s Data Lake is built on full ownership of the data and AI stack  from ingestion and storage through transformation  analytics  and model execution  all operated within Sidetrade-controlled infrastructure. Data is centralized in a single  governed Data Lake  anonymized by design  not shared with external parties  and protected by ISO 27 001 certification and disaster recovery capabilities. This architecture gives Sidetrade’s customers direct assurance on data privacy  residency  and regulatory compliance.Incoming data passes through a layered pipeline of matching  enrichment  classification  and multi-stage machine learning before it is made available for analytics and AI training. This process ensures that behavioral signals are standardized  comparable  and reliable at scale.Machine learning performance is driven by volume  continuity  and operational realism. By training on a massive corpus of supplier payment data captured directly from production workflows  Sidetrade’s models learn from how payments actually occur  not from synthetic or static samples. This depth of real-world data is what enables high-precision prediction  robust risk detection  and dependable AI-driven execution in complex financial environments.Investor relations @SidetradeChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relations @SidetradeOli Thornton 00 44 7933 108 107 oli.thornton@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade (www.sidetrade.com)Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) is an AI company redefining how enterprises secure and accelerate cash flow.
