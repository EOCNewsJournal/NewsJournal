Key drivers in the historical period included expanded institutional investment portfolios  increased global market participation  and a rise in regulatory scrutiny on asset management. The demand for third-party custody services and the complexity of multi-asset investments also contributed significantly.Looking ahead  the market is poised for continued expansion due to the adoption of digital custody platforms  heightened demand for integrated risk and liquidity reporting  and an increased focus on cybersecurity resilience. Enhanced cross-border investment activities and the evolution of alternative asset custody requirements further fuel this growth. These trends steer the market towards automated asset safekeeping platforms and integrate advanced risk and compliance monitoring tools  boosting operational transparency and data security.Foreign investment serves as a fundamental catalyst  driving the custody services market forward by escalating the need for secure and compliant asset management strategies. This trend has been accentuated by globalization  which propels investors to seek diversified opportunities across borders. These dynamics necessitate the development of sophisticated custody solutions  fostering trust among global investors. A case in point is the 2025 report from the International Monetary Fund  highlighting a global foreign direct investment surge to $41 trillion  a notable 4.4% increase from 2022.Strategic alliances are pivotal for leading firms as they seek to enhance asset security  generate passive income streams  and meet the mounting demand for blockchain-based financial services. Noteworthy is the 2025 collaboration between Paribu Custody and Figment  aiming to offer a secure staking service for institutions. This partnership integrates Paribu's robust security framework with Figment's top-tier staking technology  addressing environmental and reward-driven blockchain engagements while maintaining asset custody.Significant acquisitions are also shaping the sector  such as Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.'s acquisition of GK8 from Celsius Network LLC for $44 million in early 2023. This move strengthens Galaxy's institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure  incorporating GK8's secure custody capabilities  including its cold vault and multi-party computation.Prominent players in the institutional custody services market include The Bank of China  Citigroup Inc.  and HSBC Holdings plc  among others. While North America leads as the largest market region as of 2025  Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing area through the forecast period. Markets covered extend across various regions and nations including Australia  China  France  Germany  and the USA  to name a few.Overall  the institutional custody services market encompasses a range of services like safekeeping of assets  regulatory reporting  and trade settlement. Market value centers on service revenues within specific geographies  spotlighting direct exchanges rather than resales along supply chains.Report ScopeMarkets Covered:By Service Type: Core Custody Services; Ancillary ServicesBy Asset Class: Equities; Fixed Income; Real Estate; Alternative Investments; Other Asset ClassesBy Application: Foundations; Government Agencies; Enterprises; Other ApplicationsSubsegments:Core Custody Services: Asset Safekeeping  Transaction Settlement  Corporate Actions Processing  etc.Ancillary Services: Foreign Exchange  Performance Analytics  Tax Reclamation  etc.Key Companies Mentioned:Bank of China  Citigroup Inc.

""I think February is still ​doable in terms of a timeline.""The four-year anniversary of the war is February 24. Since Moscow's invasion  ⁠Ukraine has required hundreds of billions of dollars of support from Western ⁠governments and institutions and a more than $20 billion sovereign debt restructuring.""As of now we are waiting for the new IMF programme  but we already agreed on all ⁠the ‌numbers for this and next year and will cover it (budget deficit) from existing commitments "" Butsa said  also praising the EU's new 90 billion euro loan.He said he wasn't getting carried away by talk of a potential U.S.-brokered ceasefire ahead of this month's anniversary.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the U.S. needed to put more pressure ⁠on Russia if it wanted the war to end by summer  adding it was unclear whether ​Moscow would attend U.S.-brokered peace talks next week.""We need ‌to plan everything cautiously  we cannot get over optimistic about any news flow "" Butsa said  explaining a ceasefire wouldn't end the financial pressures anyway.""The reason ⁠for that is  even for ​a ceasefire  we believe that we need to maintain a strong and large army and we will still need to re-arm ourselves.""He said Ukraine was unlikely to rush to issue more international market debt whenever the war does end. Instead it will keep using cheap concessional lending and borrow in local currency debt markets where it doesn't face currency risk.With Ukraine's IMF programme underpinned by a so-called ⁠debt stability analysis  Butsa said the government also wouldn't be able to provide ""guarantees"" to help ​state-owned firms like Ukrainian Railways and Naftogaz restructure their debts.""We have very severe limitations on the sovereign guarantees  because it's all part of the same DSA "" he added.""So we cannot really issue guarantees "" whereas it could help the firms draw up ""proper long-term business models.""LIFTING CAPITAL CONTROLSOne of this year's other big focuses will be its wartime capital controls which it wants ⁠to keep gradually removing.The next key move would be to allow international investors to repatriate the core money - or principal payment in banker-speak - they lend to Ukraine when buying its local FX bonds.Butsa said it was ""an important element"" in its ambition to sell more local currency bonds in future and a step that could potentially happen before the war ends.Ukraine is also working with European clearing giant  Deutsche Boerse-owned Clearstream  to make its bond market more attractive and wants to be part of the European Central Bank's TARGET2 system  ​which settles trillions of euros of payments and trades a day.""We don't have much of a legacy (system) to care about  so ⁠we're happy to build immediately what works the best "" Butsa said  adding the government was likely to start looking for a ""strategic"" partner firm this year for the build-out.He also hoped ​to reclaim Ukraine's place in emerging market indices  such as JPMorgan's widely used GBI-EM local sovereign debt benchmark  ‌which attracts billions in investor money. Ukraine only ever had one of its bonds - ​which has since matured - in the index in March 2022.""That is definitely part of our strategy - we want to come back "" said Butsa. ""Our aspiration is to have our bonds index-eligible and to have our local market as a very large and sustainable source of funding.""(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Sharon Singleton)",neutral,0.07,0.93,0.01,negative,0.01,0.33,0.67,True,English,"['final IMF deal approval', 'coming weeks', 'Ukraine', 'U.S.-brokered peace talks', 'GBI-EM local sovereign debt benchmark', 'potential U.S.-brokered ceasefire', 'proper long-term business models', 'serving debt management head', 'formal IMF Board sign-off', 'new 90 billion euro loan', '$20 billion sovereign debt restructuring', 'near $140 billion budget shortfall', 'existing $15.6 billion IMF facility', 'local currency debt markets', 'new $8.2 billion programme', 'new IMF programme', 'debt stability analysis', 'cheap concessional lending', 'LIFTING CAPITAL CONTROLS', 'other big focuses', 'wartime capital controls', 'European clearing giant', 'European Central Bank', 'strategic"" partner firm', 'international market debt', 'International Monetary Fund', 'emerging market indices', 'local FX bonds', 'local currency bonds', 'next key move', 'local market', 'debt chief', 'budget deficit', 'existing commitments', 'currency risk', 'sovereign guarantees', 'international investors', 'economic stability', 'bond market', 'public spending', 'Western \u2060governments', 'Ukrainian President', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'news flow', 'financial pressures', 'Ukrainian Railways', 'severe limitations', 'same DSA', 'principal payment', 'important element', 'Deutsche Boerse-owned', 'TARGET2 system', 'legacy (system', 'sustainable source', 'Marc Jones', 'Sharon Singleton', 'fifth year', 'next year', 'core money', 'investor money', 'symbolic step', 'four-year anniversary', 'large army', '\u200bstate-owned firms', 'war ends', 'Yuriy Butsa', 'LONDON', 'Reuters', 'Ukraine', 'weeks', 'telegraphed', 'Russia', 'agreement', 'Kyiv', 'years', 'interview', 'matter', 'meetings', 'February', 'terms', 'timeline', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'dollars', 'support', 'institutions', '\u200cnumbers', 'month', 'Wednesday', 'summer', 'everything', 'reason', 'strong', 'Naftogaz', 'debts', 'banker-speak', 'ambition', 'future', 'Clearstream', 'trillions', 'euros', 'payments', 'trades', 'place', 'JPMorgan', 'index', 'March', 'strategy', 'aspiration', 'funding', 'Editing']",2026-02-13,2026-02-14,thestar.com.my

For further details please refer to this Link.The MHRA confirmed that the benefit–risk profile of IXCHIQ® remains favorable for individuals aged 18 to 59 years who are at risk of chikungunya infection and do not have the contraindicated underlying medical conditions.The update follows MHRA’s temporary suspension on the use of IXCHIQ® in older individuals1  which was based on reports of serious adverse events (SAEs)  mainly in elderly people with significant underlying medical conditions during an outbreak vaccination campaign on the French island of La Reunion.Valneva is committed to upholding the highest safety standards and will continue monitoring post marketing safety data of IXCHIQ® and work in a collaborative way with all relevant authorities to potentially further update recommendations and restrictions of use  if justified.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years2. In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas3. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem4.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Moody’s has upgraded the rating of CSG’s backed senior secured debt to Baa3  reflecting improvements in corporate governance following the company’s IPO  a simplified capital structure  and a more conservative financial strategy. Fitch Ratings has also affirmed CSG’s rating at BBB- with a Stable Outlook.Moody’s Investors Service upgraded CSG’s backed senior secured debt from the speculative-grade level of Ba1 to investment-grade Baa3. According to the agency  the upgrade reflects expectations of continued growth  strong free cash flow generation  and a solid financial profile in the coming years.A Stable Outlook from Moody’s indicates that the agency expects CSG to maintain strong performance over the next 12 to 18 months and beyond. In its assessment  Moody’s also highlighted improvements in governance and enhanced transparency of the capital structure following the IPO  the Group’s conservative financial policy  and its strategy to maintain leverage at prudent levels  including a planned gradual transition from secured to unsecured debt.Fitch Ratings  as part of a recent review and affirmation of ratings for seven European aerospace and defense companies  also affirmed CSG’s rating at BBB- with a Stable Outlook. The affirmation followed Fitch’s recent update of its Corporate Rating Criteria and had no impact on CSG’s credit assessment.Fitch’s confirmation further underscores CSG’s consistent credit profile relative to comparable European issuers in the defense and aerospace sector and reinforces market confidence in the long-term sustainability of the Group’s financial position.Credit ratings provide an independent assessment of an issuer’s creditworthiness and serve as an important benchmark for investors by indicating the likelihood that the issuer will meet its financial commitments in full and on time.CSG’s IPO marked a key milestone in the Group’s development.

The company’s current market capitalization stands at approximately EUR 30 billion.Supported by its current ratings and the favorable outlook for the European defense sector  CSG expects continued revenue growth  stable free cash flow generation  and further strengthening of confidence among investors and business partners.About CSGCSG N.V.
