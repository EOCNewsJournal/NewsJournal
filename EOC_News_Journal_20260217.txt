In 2025  a policy change by Euroclear Sweden made it possible for Sampo to pursue a direct listing of the Sampo A share on Nasdaq Stockholm  replacing the SDR arrangement. Sampo’s application to delist its SDRs and to admit the trading of its A shares was approved by Nasdaq Stockholm on 28 January 2026.The last day of trading in the SDRs was 13 February 2026. The conversion of the SDRs into A shares will be carried out automatically for all SDR holders. It does not require any action from the SDR holder. Underlying Sampo A shares will be automatically delivered to the same securities account as the SDRs are held on the record date  17 February 2026. The A shares will be delivered to SDR holders on 19 February 2026.A direct listing in the Swedish market will create a consistent Nordic presence across Nasdaq Helsinki  Nasdaq Copenhagen and Nasdaq Stockholm and will offer certain advantages for Sampo and its shareholders  including a smaller tick size on Nasdaq Stockholm compared with that applicable to the SDRs.More information on the SDR conversion is available on Sampo’s IR blog: https://www.sampo.com/investors/ir-blog/sdr-conversion/.SAMPO PLCInvestors Relations and Group CommunicationFor further information  please contact:Mirko HurmerintaInterim Head of Investor Relationstel. +358 10 516 0032Distribution:The principal mediawww.sampo.comIMPORTANT INFORMATIONNone of the information contained herein constitute an offer to sell  or the solicitation of an offer to buy or acquire  any shares  SDRs  rights or other securities of Sampo in any jurisdiction whatsoever  including but not limited to  Finland  Sweden  and other member states of the European Economic Area.

The sales price was approximately EUR 18 million and the sales gain was EUR 9.6 million. The sales gain has been excluded from the comparable EBITA.The International Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved Aspo’s near-term emissions reduction targets in October 2025.January–December 2025Net sales  Group total increased to EUR 616.3 (592.6) millionNet sales from continuing operations increased to EUR 469.1 (459.5) millionComparable EBITA  Group total grew to EUR 36.5 (29.1) million  5.9% (4.9%) of net sales ESL Shipping EUR 16.5 (16.9) million Telko EUR 17.9 (12.6) million Discontinued operation EUR 7.1 (5.1) million Other operations EUR -5.0 (-5.4) millionEBITA  Group total was EUR 43.1 (21.2) million.

The sale is expected to generate a gain of approximately EUR 16 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals  and it is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026. Consequently  Leipurin is presented as a discontinued operation  and the comparative figures have been restated.The Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.25 (0.19) per share for financial year 2025.Figures from the corresponding period in 2024 are presented in brackets.Guidance for 2026Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA from continuing operations is expected to increase compared with the previous year (EUR 29.4 million in 2025).Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA from continuing operations excludes Leipurin  which is reported as a discontinued operation. The divestment of Leipurin was announced on August 15  2025  and it is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2026.Assumptions behind the guidanceEconomic growth is expected to slowly revive throughout the year in our core markets  however  the markets are expected to continue challenging in the early part of the year. Geopolitical uncertainty and global trade tensions are also expected to have a negative impact on economic growth and global trade going forward. Aspo’s profit improvement for 2026 is expected to come mainly from various profit improvement actions in ESL Shipping and Telko  fleet renewal and improved fleet utilization in ESL Shipping  continued synergy capture from Telko’s acquisitions  and a reduction of Aspo-level costs while the implementation of Aspo’s strategic transformation continues. Possible costs related to the execution of Aspo’s strategic transformation are excluded from Aspo’s comparable EBITA.For ESL Shipping  demand is expected to slightly improve for 2026  with spot market pricing also gradually improving from the current low levels. High level of dockings is expected to negatively impact the second quarter of the year.For Telko  overall stable market development is expected going forward. Telko is expected to continue to grow via acquisitions in 2026. Possible acquisition-related expenses are excluded from the comparable EBITA.Key figures 10-12/2025 10-12/2024 1-12/2025 1-12/2024 Net sales Group total  MEUR 158.0 159.8 616.3 592.6 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 119.3 124.5 469.1 459.5 EBITA Group total  MEUR 16.2 8.1 43.1 21.2 Comparable EBITA Group total  MEUR 8.9 8.0 36.5 29.1 Comparable EBITA Group total  % 5.7 5.0 5.9 4.9 EBITA from continuing operations  MEUR 14.9 7.0 36.8 16.6 Comparable EBITA from continuing operations  MEUR 7.0 6.9 29.4 24.1 Comparable EBITA from continuing operations  % 5.8 5.5 6.3 5.2 Profit for the period Group total  MEUR 11.6 6.0 28.0 7.3 Comparable profit for the period from continuing operations  MEUR2.7 5.3 15.8 11.6 Earnings per share (EPS) Group total  EUR 0.29 0.15 0.72 0.14 Comparable EPS  Group total  EUR 0.06 0.15 0.51 0.39 Comparable EPS from continuing operations  EUR 0.01 0.13 0.34 0.27 Free cash flow  MEUR 26.2 -18.7 26.5 -36.1 Free cash flow per share  EUR 0.8 -0.6 0.8 -1.2 Comparable ROCE from continuing operations  % 7.6 8.1 8.3 7.7 Return on equity (ROE) Group total  % 29.4 13.2 15.9 4.4 Comparable ROE Group total  % 10.8 13.0 12.1 9.2 Invested capital from continuing operations  MEUR 355.6 353.9 Net debt Group total  MEUR 212.8 188.0 Net debt / comparable EBITDA  12 months rolling 3.6 3.2 Equity per share  EUR 4.58 5.13 Equity ratio  % 31.9 36.9The calculation principles of key figures are included in Aspo’s Board of Directors’ 2024 report. The figures presented in this financial statements release have been individually rounded or calculated based on exact figures  so the figures may not add up to rounded totals.Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the fourth quarter of 2025:When reviewing the full year 2025  Aspo grew its comparable EBITA  Group total to EUR 36.5 (29.1) million. This profitability improvement of more than 25% was achieved in a challenging market during 2025. This shows that the actions taken  both strategic and operational improvements  are yielding results. In 2025  the earnings per share (EPS) Group total increased to EUR 0.72 (0.14) both because of the profitability improvement and due to a successful divestment of M/S Kallio to the Norwegian The Qrill Company AS in October 2025. The entire personnel of Aspo deserves recognition for this great achievement -thank you for a successful 2025!In the fourth quarter  Aspo’s net sales Group total remained at last year’s level due to the challenging market conditions. Aspo’s comparable EBITA Group total grew and was EUR 8.9 million  compared with EUR 8.0 million in the corresponding period in the previous year.ESL Shipping’s comparable EBITA declined to EUR 3.8 (4.3) million. ESL Shipping’s profitability was negatively impacted  especially in the Coaster vessel segment  by the continued weak spot market and softer than expected forest industry demand. These drivers are unchanged from the previous quarter  but further actions have been taken to improve profitability  including fleet renewal and actions for improving capacity utilization.Telko improved its comparable EBITA to EUR 4.4 (3.9) million due to higher sales margin  driven by a higher share of specialty products. Volumes were in decline  driven by modest demand particularly in Europe. Developing the supply chain and transforming poorly performing businesses contributed to the improved financial performance.On August 15  2025  Aspo signed an agreement to divest its Leipurin business to Lantmännen at an enterprise value of EUR 63 million. We expect the divestment of Leipurin to be completed during the first quarter of 2026  as obtaining the regulatory approvals has progressed according to plan.Leipurin’s positive profitability development trend continued  and the comparable EBITA of discontinued operations was EUR 2.0 (1.1) million. Profitability improvement was boosted by EUR 0.6 million  as no depreciation was recognized  but in a like-for-like comparison  Leipurin’s profitability also improved by approximately EUR 0.3 million.The International Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved Aspo’s near-term emissions reduction targets in October 2025. This entails a reduction of the businesses’ own emissions through fleet investments and switching to renewable fuels. Furthermore  we aim to reduce emissions outside our own operations in cooperation with suppliers and partners.In November 2025  we communicated that our main strategic alternatives are either to divest ESL Shipping or implement a partial demerger of Aspo. Our aim is to find the best solution for ESL Shipping and Telko in terms of value creation and businesses development. In 2026 we will focus on executing this transformation of Aspo. As communicated recently  I will also take on the role of Managing Director of Telko  and with the team  we will evaluate the integration of Telko’s and Aspo’s operations. We will continue to strengthen Telko and ESL Shipping as stand-alone companies offering attractive investment cases  with clear growth strategies and continued efforts for profitability improvement.ASPO GROUPFinancial performance and targetsAspo’s long-term financial targets at Group total level are:Minimum increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearComparable EBITA of 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Net debt to comparable EBITDA  rolling 12 months ratio below 3.0At a business level  ESL Shipping’s long-term comparable EBITA target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. Leipurin is reported as a discontinued operation.In January–December 2025  Aspo’s net sales Group total grew by 4.0% to EUR 616.3 (592.6) million. The comparable EBITA Group total rate stood at 5.9% (4.9%). Comparable return on equity Group total was 12.1% (9.2%) and the net debt to comparable EBITDA Group total  rolling 12 months ratio was 3.6 (3.2).The Board of Directors’ dividend proposalAccording to Aspo's dividend policy  Aspo’s dividend growth is based on positive profitability development with the aim to pay-out annually up to 50% of net profit as dividend. The ambition is to gradually increase the amount of dividends  while considering the financing needs of growth initiatives with strategic priority.The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of Aspo Plc to be held on April 17  2026  that EUR 0.25 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2025 financial year  and that no dividend be paid for shares held by Aspo Plc. The proposed dividend represents 49% of Aspo’s comparable earnings per share for 2025. It is proposed that the dividend be paid in one instalment.It is proposed that the dividend of EUR 0.25 per share be paid to shareholders registered on the record date of April 21  2026  in the company’s register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy. The Board proposes that the payment date for the dividend will be April 28  2026.On December 31  2025  the distributable funds of the parent company were EUR 50 425 376.24  with the profit for the financial year totaling EUR 16 086 605.41. There are a total of 31 292 617 shares entitled to dividends on the publication date of this financial statement release. As a result  the proposed dividend would total EUR 7.8 million.No material changes have taken place in respect of Aspo’s financial position since the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Board of Directors  the proposed distribution of profits does not risk the solvency of the company.Espoo  February 16  2026Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsNews conference for analysts  investors and the mediaA news conference for analysts  investors and the media will be held at Sanomatalo  Flik Studio Eliel  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  Helsinki on February 16  2026  at 12.00 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing viestinta@aspo.com.

A universal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunization program using Beyfortus (nirsevimab) was associated with a statistically significant reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations in the second RSV season among infants immunized during their first season  according to a new study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The NIRSE-GAL study  conducted in Galicia  Spain  is the first prospective real-world population study to evaluate the impact of a universal Beyfortus immunization program during two consecutive RSV seasons. The study findings  comparing the number of hospitalizations in immunized infants during their second RSV season versus the number of expected hospitalization cases based on data from recent seasons  are being presented at RSVVW ’26 (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines for the Word) conference in Rome  Italy.The coverage rate was 94.4% among the cohort (11 796 infants out of 12 492 eligible) and the study showed a substantial reduction of 85.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.2–90.0) in RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) hospitalizations during the first season. The study also showed 55.3% (95% CI 22.5-74.3) fewer hospitalizations in the second RSV season among infants who received a dose of Beyfortus during infancy. By preventing severe RSV infections during the first months of life  a critical period of lung development  it is thought the infants may be less prone to subsequent admissions from either RSV or other infections.""This universal RSV immunization program with Beyfortus showed decreased RSV-related hospitalizations and outpatient illness burden during the first season  with persistent impact seen on RSV hospitalizations through the second season ” said Federico Martinón-Torres  Head of Pediatrics at Santiago University Hospital in Spain  and principal investigator of the NIRSE-GAL study. “These results offer compelling population-based data to inform infant immunization strategies and economic evaluation models.”""This study builds upon our wealth of evidence supporting the public health value of a Beyfortus immunization program ” said Thomas Triomphe  Executive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi. “It’s exciting to see the significant impact of this infant immunization program during the first RSV season and truly remarkable to consider a benefit across two seasons.”Further findingsThe study also showed reductions in primary care consultations during the first RSV season  including:30.8% (17.5-41.9) reduction in first consultations for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis;33.4% (21.6-43.4) reduction in consultations for lower respiratory tract infections and;27.7% (14.9-38.5) reduction in consultations for wheezing or asthma.Furthermore  rehospitalizations in infants previously hospitalized due to RSV decreased considerably during the second RSV season  with a 78.2% (25.6–93.6) reduction in RSV-related rehospitalizations and a 62.4% (30.9–79.6) reduction in LRTI rehospitalizations. These data support the hypothesis that early protection against RSV-related damage to the lungs may have lasting beneficial effects on respiratory health.About RSVRSV is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants. It is a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in otherwise healthy infants born at term. Older infants born before the RSV season are also at risk of RSV disease and make up around half of infant RSV hospitalizations. Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday. Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations and an estimated 26 300 in-hospital RSV-attributable deaths of children younger than five years. RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient  and follow-up care — were estimated at c.€5 billion in 2017.About BeyfortusBeyfortus (nirsevimab) is the first RSV immunization designed to help protect all infants through their first RSV season  including for those born healthy at term or preterm  and those with health conditions that make them vulnerable to RSV disease. Beyfortus is also approved for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.With an extended half-life of 71 days  Beyfortus is a long-acting monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Administration is timed to coincide with the RSV season and is provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose. Beyfortus offers rapid protection without requiring activation of the immune system.Along with efficacy and safety demonstrated in clinical studies  the effectiveness of Beyfortus has been evaluated in more than 50 real-world studies  including more than 400 000 infants who were immunized. Since the launch  over 11 million infants have been immunized with Beyfortus across more than 45 countries.About SanofiSanofi is an R&D driven  AI-powered biopharma company committed to improving people’s lives and creating compelling growth.

This performance underscores the resilience of our business model  which is built on a balanced presence across developed and emerging markets  as well as a local-to-local approach. It also demonstrates the importance of the long-term vision of our corporate strategy  and the unwavering commitment of our employees across 12 countries. In 2025  the Group achieved strong free cash flow generation for the third consecutive year and continued the disciplined execution of its roadmap  with an EBITDA margin of 20%  a significant reduction in net debt  and further progress on decarbonization. In this respect  the progress made toward obtaining European and French subsidies for VAIA  our flagship carbon capture project in France  marks an important milestone. The outlook for 2026 is positive  underpinned by the ramp-up of kiln 6 in Senegal  the integration of Realmix in Brazil  the TELT project and the first signs of a gradual recovery in France.”The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 13 February 2025. The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been performed. The auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements is in the process of being issued.Activity: acceleration in the fourth quarter brings full-year 2025 organic sales growth to +3.3%The Group’s consolidated sales reached €3 854 million in 2025  up +3.3% on a like-for-like basis. Growth accelerated gradually throughout the year  reaching +8.1% on a like-for-like basis in the fourth quarter.On a reported basis  sales showed a limited decline of -0.8% in 2025  including:An unfavorable exchange rate effect of -€242 million (or -6.2%)  reflecting the depreciation of the Turkish lira  the Egyptian pound  the US dollar  the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real against the euro  despite a slight positive contribution from the Swiss franc.of -€242 million (or -6.2%)  reflecting the depreciation of the Turkish lira  the Egyptian pound  the US dollar  the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real against the euro  despite a slight positive contribution from the Swiss franc. A consolidation scope effect of +€82 million (or +2.1%)  primarily reflecting the full-year integration of Cermix into Vicat’s construction chemicals business (VPI)  as well as the integration of Realmix in Brazil from September 2025 onwards.In 2025  the Group’s business was marked by a stabilization of cement volumes in France at the end of the year at a historically low level  a sustained recovery in Switzerland throughout the year  as well as a slowdown in the US market. Emerging countries reported a marked improvement in their activity  particularly in Brazil and the Mediterranean region. By contrast  trends in Asia and Africa were more mixed.Cement: Following a first-half decline  cement volumes rebounded in the second half  leading to full-year growth of +3.0%. This dynamic reflects a gradual stabilization in France  a sustained recovery in Switzerland and a strong performance in the Mediterranean region  offsetting the decline in volumes in the United States. Cement prices remained resilient overall in the Group’s key regions: they rose in most emerging countries  with the exception of India and Senegal  and held steady in developed countries. Cement consolidated sales rose by +6.5% on a like-for-like basis.Following a first-half decline  cement volumes rebounded in the second half  leading to full-year growth of +3.0%.

Cement consolidated sales rose by +6.5% on a like-for-like basis. Concrete & Aggregates: Concrete volumes remained stable in 2025 (+0.9%)  supported by strong growth in Brazil and Turkey. However  this evolution was partially offset by a decline in the United States  particularly in California  and by a moderate downturn in France. Aggregates volumes rose sharply in 2025 (+9.7%) across most of the Group’s countries  with the exception of France  and saw particularly strong growth in Turkey and Senegal.

Consolidated sales for this business remained stable  up +0.2% on a like-for-like basis. Other Products & Services: Consolidated sales of Other Products & Services posted an increase of +16.8% on a reported basis owing to the integration of Cermix’s construction chemicals business. Excluding scope effects  the business decreased slightly by -2 5%  notably due to an unfavorable base of comparison in Switzerland (Vigier Rail).EBITDA: +3.7% increase in 2025 on a like-for-like basis; 5.9% unfavorable exchange rate impactGroup EBITDA reached €771 million in 2025  up +3.7% on a like-for-like basis  in line with the guidance of +2% to +5% communicated in July 2025. This performance reflects strong growth in the Mediterranean region and in Brazil  improvement in Switzerland and Africa  and stabilization in France  despite a marked slowdown in the United States.On a reported basis  EBITDA contracted slightly by ‑1.6%  including an unfavorable exchange rate effect of ‑€46 million and a scope effect of +€4 million.The Group’s EBITDA margin stood at 20.0%  virtually unchanged from its 2024 level.Like-for-like EBITDA growth in 2025 was driven by a positive volume effect of +€18 million  in cement and aggregates  as well as by an improvement in the price/cost differential:Prices made a positive contribution (+€109 million in 2025)  thanks to broadly resilient selling prices in developed countries and increases implemented in most emerging countries  with the exception of India and Senegal.Costs rose again in 2025 (-€105 million in 2025 at constant volume). The decline in energy costs was more than offset by wage inflation  and to a lesser extent by higher maintenance costs.Industrial performance improved in the Cement business  notably driven by an increase in the use of alternative fuels  as a substitute for fossil energy  which rose by +1.4 points compared with 2024  reaching 37.4%.Recurring EBIT amounted to €445 million  down -2.7% in 2025 (up +4.0% on a like-for-like basis)  with the margin declining by -30 basis points.Further increase in consolidated net incomeNet financial income amounted to -€55 million in 2025  an improvement of €17 million compared to 2024.This change primarily reflects the lower cost of net debt  which improved by €23 million  driven by a reduction in the average debt volume and lower interest rates  net of hedging. However  this was partially offset by a reduction in the contribution from other financial income and expenses  down by €6 million.The tax charge is €24 million higher than in 2024. The effective tax rate stands at 28.0%  significantly higher than the 24.7% recorded in 2024. This overall increase in the tax charge was due to the rise in pre-tax income from ordinary activities  as well as to non-recurring items (charges on dividends  exceptional tax contribution in France  etc.).Consolidated net income amounted to €307 million  up 11.9% on a like-for-like basis and +5.7% on a reported basis. The net margin was 8.0%  up +50 basis points.Net income  Group share rose by +6.0% on a like-for-like basis and +0.8% on a reported basis. The change in Net income Group’s share  compared to that of consolidated net income  was due to the increase in income attributable to minority interests. This increase reflects the significantly improved performance of subsidiaries in Brazil  Egypt  and Turkey.Analysis by geographic regions2025 consolidated sales:(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* France 1 198 1 158 +3.5% -2.6% Europe (excluding France) 443 411 +7.9% +6.3% Americas 943 1 004 -6.0% -2.0% Asia 393 439 -10.5% -1.5% Mediterranean 514 498 +3.3% +34.4% Africa 363 375 -3.3% -2.9% TOTAL 3 854 3 884 -0.8% +3.3%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates2025 EBITDA:(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* France 198 195 +1.1% -1.0% Europe (excluding France) 118 110 +7.4% +5.8% Americas 198 249 -20.6% -16.2% Asia 67 84 -19.9% -12.2% Mediterranean 119 78 +52.3% +90.9% Africa 71 67 +6.2% +6.9% TOTAL 771 783 -1.6% +3.7%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesFrance posted solid  resilient results in a context where residential market is at its lowest level in 25 years. After stabilizing in the third quarter  cement sales showed a modest recovery in the fourth quarter of 2025. Cement prices remained stable throughout the year. The TELT project also made a positive contribution to sales. The Group has joined forces with the Belgian group Koramic to create a new industrial entity  60% owned by Vicat  bringing together 7 sites in France around the Vicat Produits Industriels (VPI) and Cermix brands. This structuring operation is designed to sustainably strengthen the Group’s position in construction chemicals in France.In Europe (excluding France)  results improved in 2025  driven by the solid performance of the Cement and Concrete & Aggregates businesses in Switzerland  as well as by the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. The Cement business in Switzerland grew thanks to higher volumes driven by the recovery of the Swiss market  Vigier’s exposure to several major infrastructure projects  and the commercial success of Vigier’s low-carbon cement (Progresso). The Concrete & Aggregates business also benefited from the ramp-up of the Flumenthal treatment unit  whose operating efficiency made a significant contribution to improving costs.Results in the Americas region were impacted by the slowdown in the United States  despite solid performance in Brazil. In the United States  continued weakness in the residential market  coupled with political uncertainty  weighed on the Cement and Concrete businesses. In Brazil  business accelerated throughout the year  driven by favorable market momentum and sustained commercial development in the Midwest region. The acquisition of Realmix in concrete  integrated from 1 September 2025  also made a positive contribution to growth in cement volumes towards the end of the year. Unfavorable exchange rate evolution had a negative impact on the region’s performance.The Group’s results in Asia decreased  due to a challenging competitive environment in India that weighed on pricing  as well as higher energy costs in Kazakhstan that impacted profitability. After a difficult first half  the Cement business in India showed signs of improvement in the second half of the year  supported by volume growth thanks to a favorable base effect and targeted commercial initiatives. However  prices were highly volatile throughout the year. The depreciation of the Indian rupee and Kazakh tenge against the euro also weighed on the region’s performance.Results from the Mediterranean region rose sharply  driven by continued strong export momentum in Egypt—now reinforced by a recovery in domestic demand—and by accelerating market activity in Turkey. Prices were well-oriented both in Turkey  to offset the effects of inflation  and in Egypt. Performance in the region was once again impacted by the sharp depreciation of the Turkish and Egyptian currencies against the euro during the period.The Group’s results in Africa improved in 2025  boosted by the initial effects of the ramp-up of kiln 6 in the fourth quarter and the acceleration of the Aggregates business in Senegal  despite the impact of political upheaval on activity in Mali. In Senegal  the Cement business was impacted by a decline in domestic prices early in the year  following the entry of a new market participant. However  this pressure on prices was partially offset by a gradual improvement in volumes during the year. The Aggregates business in Senegal benefited from the resumption of several major public works projects  notably the accelerated construction of the Port of Ndayane  south of Dakar.A more detailed analysis of performance by region is provided in the appendix to this press release.Investment and cash generation: another year of strong free cash flowIn 2025  net capital expenditure amounted to €299 million  down from €320 million in 2024. This amount included strategic growth investments  notably the final disbursement related to kiln 6 in Senegal. The Group also seized land opportunities in Turkey and France to secure long-term mineral reserves.For the third consecutive year  the Group delivered strong free cash flow generation  amounting to €324 million in 2025. Free cash flow was nevertheless lower than in 2024 (€373 million)  primarily due to an unfavorable exchange rate effect  non-recurring items in the second half (including a CAPN2-related disbursement)  and higher-than-expected net capital expenditure.Financial position: further net debt reduction(€ million) 31 DEC 2025 31 DEC 2024 31 DEC 2023 Gross debt 1 680 1 772 1 915 Cash -528 -536 -493 Net debt (excluding options) 1 151 1 237 1 422 Leverage ratio 1.49x 1.58x 1.92xAs of 31 December 2025  the Group’s financial structure remains robust  with a high level of shareholders’ equity and a year-on-year €85 million reduction in net debt. The leverage ratio stood at 1.49x  compared to 1.58x as of 31 December 2024.The Group had €877 million in undrawn confirmed financing lines not allocated to the coverage of liquidity risk on NEU CP as of 31 December 2025  compared to €847 million at 31 December 2024. These financing lines guarantee a high level of liquidity for the Group.Climate performance2025 2024 Change 2030 targets Direct specific emissions(kg CO 2 net per ton of cement equivalent) 572 576 -0.7% 497 Direct specific emissions in Europe(kg CO 2 net per ton of cement equivalent) 479 497 -3.6% 430 Alternative fuel rate (%) 37.4% 36.0% +1 3 pts 50.0% Clinker rate (%) 76.0% 76.3% -0.3 pts 69.0%The Group’s climate performance in 2025 was characterized by progress on all indicators. The alternative fuels rate  up for the fifth consecutive year  corresponds to 1.7 million tonnes of alternative fuels consumed  replacing 1.2 million tonnes of coal.In France  the reduction of the clinker factor below the 80% threshold—driven in particular by the contribution of the DECA low-carbon range and the increase in the substitution rate to over 70% (+5 points year-on-year) made a significant contribution to the decrease in specific emissions in Europe.In the United States  the contribution from Ragland’s more efficient kiln 2 and the switch to type 1L cement in California and the Southeast contributed to improvements in both the alternative fuel rate and the clinker factor. The alternative fuel rate also rose sharply in India thanks to the start-up of new solid recovered fuel preparation facilities in Bharathi and Kalburgi  as well as the diversification of supply sources.However  the evolution of the Group’s geographic sales mix (higher exports in Egypt and volume growth in Mumbai in India  etc.) limited the reduction in the clinker rate in 2025.An attractive dividend policyFor the 2025 financial year  the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of €2.0 per share at the next General Meeting  unchanged from 2024  representing a yield of 2.6%3.The Vicat Group stands out for its stable and predictable distribution policy  as its dividend has never been reduced over the past 30 years.HighlightsOn 12 February 2026  the VAIA (Vicat Advanced Industrial Alliance) project was awarded a GPID grant by the French government.This recognition follows on from the public sector support obtained after the project was selected for funding under the European Innovation Fund program in November 2025. In total  the Group has been awarded €340 million in subsidies  including support from the Innovation Fund and GPID  for an investment currently estimated at €700 million  excluding subsidies. The agreements for these subsidies should be finalized in the coming months.The GPID grant is part of the French government’s Major Investment Plans to accelerate the country’s ecological and industrial transition. This program aims to support innovative and structuring projects  particularly those that contribute to the decarbonization of industry  the modernization of infrastructure  and the competitiveness of strategic sectors.Outlook for 2026In 2026  growth momentum is set to continue  despite persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Against a backdrop of volatile exchange rates  the Group has set the following targets for 2026:Slight growth in sales on a like-for-like basisSlight growth in EBITDA on a like-for-like basisNet capital expenditure of around €290 millionThese objectives take into account:An acceleration in performance in the second half of the year reflecting the seasonal nature of the business;reflecting the seasonal nature of the business; Stabilizing energy costs.The Vicat Group also confirms its medium-term priorities:Continued net debt reduction  with a leverage ratio expected to be at or below 1.0x at year-end 2027;Maintaining an EBITDA margin of at least 20% over the 2025-2027 period.Outlook by geographic region for 2026:In France  after showing signs of stabilization in the second half of 2025  the residential construction market is expected to continue its soft landing  with a gradual and moderate recovery from 2026 onwards. However  visibility remains limited in an uncertain political context  and with municipal elections scheduled for March. In Switzerland  the market should continue to recover thanks to solid economic fundamentals and very low interest rates. Major infrastructure projects in France and Switzerland should bolster business. The gradual integration of the cost of decarbonization should support the favorable price trends in Europe.In the United States  against a backdrop of persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties  visibility for 2026 remains limited. A recovery in the residential construction market is only likely to materialize once mortgage interest rates have decreased. On the non-residential market  a slight recovery is expected  supported by a more favorable base effect from April onwards  in an economic environment that remains resilient. Cement pricing should help absorb the impact of inflation. The weakness of the dollar is expected to continue to weigh on Group’s results.Business in emerging countries should remain well-oriented despite persistent negative exchange rate effects  particularly in the Mediterranean region. In Egypt  growth is set to continue at a more moderate pace  driven by exports and an improving domestic market. In Turkey  despite the backdrop of persistent hyperinflation  momentum should remain favorable  supported by public spending and a positive base effect in the first quarter. In Brazil  Realmix’s contribution should support growth in cement volumes over the first part of 2026. In India  despite a positive base effect in the first quarter  visibility remains limited  with prices likely to remain volatile  particularly in the South where the competition is more intense. Senegal is expected to benefit from the full-year contribution of kiln 6  along with sustained momentum in the Aggregates business.Presentation meeting and conference callIn connection with this publication  the Vicat Group will hold an information conference call in English on 17 February 2026 at 3 pm CET Paris (2 pm London and 9 am New York).This conference call will be webcast on Vicat’s website or directly via the following link:Vicat 2025 FY ResultsA recording of this conference call will be immediately available for replay on Vicat’s website or via the same link.Upcoming eventsAnnual General Meeting 10 April 2026First-quarter 2026 sales 4 May 2026 - publication after market close(Embargo period starts 19 April 2026)ContactsInvestor RelationsPierre PedrosaTel: +33 6 73 25 98 06pierre.pedrosa@vicat.fr PressRaphael HinningerTel: +33 7 61 74 86 52raphael.hinninger@vicat.frAbout VicatFor 170 years  Vicat has been a leading player in the mineral and biosourced building materials industry.

While this performance is encouraging  visibility remains limited  particularly in view of the political context and the municipal elections scheduled for March  which are likely to weigh on the small infrastructure segment. The residential market continues its soft landing  and the recovery in housing construction in France is expected to remain gradual and moderate in 2026. Cement prices remained stable throughout 2025. On the Lyon–Turin infrastructure project (TELT)  the first boring machine has been operating on the French side since the end of the year  with three additional boring machines scheduled for commissioning between mid-2026 and 2027—developments that are expected to support and accelerate cement consumption on this major project. Against this backdrop  operational sales for the Cement business stabilized over the full year at -0.3%. After a difficult first half of the year  EBITDA recovered in the second half  taking full-year growth to +5.3%. This increase reflects the improvement in volumes in the second half of the year  amplified by positive operational leverage and strict cost control.Operational sales for the Concrete & Aggregates business declined slightly in 2025  down -3.0% on a constant scope basis  reflecting lower concrete and aggregates volumes over the year  while prices remained broadly stable. The concrete and aggregates markets remain contrasted  with marked regional disparities. EBITDA fell by -10.4%  mainly due to lower volumes and inflation in fixed costs.Operational sales for Other Products & Services rose by +15.5% on a reported basis  thanks to the scope effect related to the integration of Cermix into the construction chemicals division (VPI). At constant scope  the construction chemicals and transportation businesses remained broadly stable over the year. EBITDA for Other Products & Services rose by +8.3% on a reported basis. This evolution mainly reflects the dilutive effect of the integration of Cermix  whose margin rate is nevertheless expected to improve as synergies are delivered.Europe (Switzerland and Italy)(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 443 411 +7.9% +6.3% EBITDA 118 110 +7.4% +5.8% Recurring EBIT 81 74 +9.2% +7.5%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesThe Cement business in Switzerland grew in 2025  driven by higher volumes linked to the market recovery  as well as Vigier’s exposure to several major infrastructure projects (renovation of the Weissenstein tunnel  construction of the Gléresse tunnel). The commercial success of Vigier’s low-carbon cement  particularly the Progresso range  also contributed positively  supported by the launch of flagship projects. Prices decreased in the first part of the year  due to a less favorable customer mix  and stabilized in the second half of 2025. Operational sales for the Cement business were up +7.8% on a like-for-like basis  and +9.6% on a reported basis  thanks to the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. EBITDA rose +7.3% on a like-for-like basis.Operational sales for the Concrete & Aggregates business rose by +13.1% on a reported basis in 2025  driven by good momentum in aggregates over the full year and an acceleration in concrete sales in the second half. Prices remained resilient over the period. EBITDA rose by +16.4%  driven in particular by the ramp-up of the Flumenthal aggregates treatment unit  whose operating efficiency contributed significantly to cost improvements.Operational sales for Other Products & Services in Switzerland declined by -6.8% on a like-for-like basis in 2025  impacted by an unfavorable base effect for Vigier Rail (delivery in 2024 of an exceptional project following the accident in the Gotthard Tunnel). EBITDA declined by -17.4% over the period.In Italy  operational sales fell by -5.7%  following lower volumes in the second half  against a backdrop of very slight price erosion. EBITDA decreased by only -4.7% thanks to strict cost control.Americas (United States and Brazil)(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 943 1 004 -6.0% -2.0% EBITDA 198 249 -20.6% -16.2% Recurring EBIT 120 167 -28.0% -23.7%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesIn the United States  cement sales showed contrasting trends: volumes were down in California  with growth in the Southeast only partially compensating for this. The residential market was affected by persistently high mortgage rates  while the non-residential market suffered from a climate of uncertainty linked to changes in tax and tariff policies implemented by the US administration in 2025. The pricing environment remained overall stable over the year  despite a slight erosion in the Southeast. Against this backdrop of uncertainty  Cement operational sales fell by -6.3% on a like-for-like basis in 2025  and -10.3% on a reported basis  impacted by the dollar’s depreciation against the euro from the second quarter of 2025. EBITDA declined by -19.3% on a reported basis  reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable operational leverage.Concrete operational sales in the United States were down -9.9% on a like-for-like basis  and -13.7% on a reported basis  due to the slowdown in California  despite higher prices. EBITDA declined sharply  reflecting both a negative volume effect and higher input costs (aggregates).In Brazil  the Cement business accelerated throughout the year  driven by good market momentum and solid business development in the Midwest region  in Brasília and the state of Goiás. The contribution of Realmix  consolidated since September  also supported growth in cement volumes. Cement prices rose in the second half of the year  following a slight downturn in the first half. Cement operational sales rose by +13.3% on a like-for-like basis and by +4.7% on a reported basis in 2025  impacted by the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the euro. EBITDA rose by +4.0% (+12.5% on a like-for-like basis)  thanks in particular to good control of variable costs  especially energy costs.The Concrete & Aggregates business in Brazil benefited from strong sales momentum  with higher volumes including the contribution from Realmix and sharply rising prices across both segments. Operational sales therefore rose by +19.1% on a like-for-like basis and by +21.1% on a reported basis. The negative exchange rate effect partially offset the positive impact of the consolidation of Realmix since September 2025. EBITDA rose +18.4% (+27.1% on a like-for-like basis).Asia (India and Kazakhstan)(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 393 439 -10.5% -1.5% EBITDA 67 84 -19.9% -12.2% Recurring EBIT 36 53 -31.0% -24.6%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesAfter a difficult first half of the year  the Cement business in India recovered in the second half  driven by higher volumes  thanks to a favorable base effect and targeted commercial initiatives. Over the full year 2025  the decline in volumes remained limited  with contrasting trends across regions: volumes up in Maharashtra  buoyed by demand in Mumbai  and down in the southern states. Prices were highly volatile  reflecting a still tense competitive environment in the South amid ongoing market consolidation. Over 2025  operational sales were down -4.6% on a like-for-like basis  and -12.3% on a reported basis  penalized by the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the euro. EBITDA fell by -20.1% (-13.0% on a like-for-like basis). This trend reflects a deterioration in the pricing environment and a decline in volumes  despite effective cash cost control at Kalburgi  supported in particular by a sharp increase in the alternative fuel rate.In Kazakhstan  selling prices rose in 2025  only partially offsetting higher fuel and energy costs. Volumes rose very slightly over the year  driven mainly by domestic demand  while exports declined over the period. Operational sales rose +17.0% like-for-like and +0.8% on a reported basis owing to the depreciation of the tenge against the euro over the period. EBITDA fell by -20.5% (-7.7% on a like-for-like basis).Mediterranean (Turkey and Egypt)(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 514 498 +3.3% +34.4% EBITDA 119 78 +52.3% +90.9% Recurring EBIT 96 51 +85.8% +128.0%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesAgainst a backdrop of persistent hyperinflation  Cement business in Turkey accelerated sharply from the second quarter onwards  buoyed by the recovery of the infrastructure and building markets  and supported by government initiatives to boost public spending in the Ankara region and rebuild areas affected by the February 2023 earthquake. Selling prices rose significantly to absorb the impact of inflation on production costs. Against this backdrop  Cement operational sales grew by +33.9% on a like-for-like basis  compared with a -2.9% decline on a reported basis  penalized by the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira against the euro. EBITDA rose sharply by +44.9% in 2025 (+99.7% on a like-for-like basis)  driven by strict cost control and improved operating performance at the Bastas plant.Concrete & Aggregates operational sales in Turkey improved by +19.4% like-for-like (down -13.4% on a reported basis due to exchange rate). EBITDA fell by -77.4% (-68.8% on a like-for-like basis). Price increases in concrete and aggregates only very partially offset inflation in production costs  with regards to both wages and energy.The Cement business in Egypt benefited from sustained export momentum  with volumes rising sharply over the full year  as well as a rebound in the domestic market in the second half  driven in particular by several ongoing megaprojects  including the Ras El Hekma and Al Sahel real estate developments. Export prices rose in the first half before stabilizing in the second. Although down on the peak seen in June  prices in the domestic market remained well-oriented throughout the year. In this context  operational sales rose by +41.1% like-for-like and by +24.4% on a reported basis  impacted by the depreciation of the Egyptian pound against the euro. EBITDA surged by +78.5% (+102.5% on a like-for-like basis).Africa (Senegal  Mali  Mauritania)(€ million) 2025 2024 Changereported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 363 375 -3.3% -2.9% EBITDA 71 67 +6.2% +6.9% Recurring EBIT 31 22 +39.3% +40.8%* Like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesIn 2025  the Cement business in Senegal was impacted by a deterioration in selling prices in the domestic market due to the entry of a new competitor at the end of 2024  despite moderate growth in volumes. Thus  Cement operational sales in Senegal contracted by -2.7% over the full year. EBITDA grew by +0.5%  mainly driven by the ramp-up of kiln 6 in the fourth quarter  which eliminates the need for clinker purchases and allows for the shutdown of kilns 3 and 4  resulting in improved production costs. Kiln 6 continues to ramp up and should reach its nominal capacity in the coming months  contributing to the gradual improvement in margins.Aggregates operational sales in Senegal rose by +26.7% over the full year  driven by a sharp increase in volumes from the second quarter onwards  following the resumption of several major public works projects. The acceleration of construction work on the port of Ndayane  located south of Dakar  also boosted activity. Prices rose slightly over the period.

Let the meteorologists forgive me  but I understood nothing—something like…if it doesn’t rain it will snow  but we might also have sunshine! In any case  no one seems discouraged; I think bookings are full everywhere at the winter resorts  as well as at the carnivals  Galaxidi  etc.Fresh polls: Karystianou slips  Tsipras steady  4 battle for 2nd placeAs for current affairs  within the week we will have fresh polls. I don’t know what all the surveys show  but I have a picture from my source; however  I think the trend is the same. Generally  and always according to the measurement data  the government continues the slight upward course it has recorded since the beginning of the year—don’t imagine anything dramatic  half a point  maybe a bit more. The same does not apply  of course  to the others. Karystianou shows signs of slight fatigue and is slipping both in potential voting intention and in popularity  though nothing major; she remains second. Tsipras maintains his mediocre performances but shows stability  an indication that he is “cementing” a specific audience  and he is third. I repeat  these two “parties” are measured unofficially because they have not been announced. So in vote estimation it is ND at 30%-31%  President Maria at 14%  our Alexis at 12.5%  and just below  neck and neck  Nikos with Zoitsa  who has dropped  which is why she is shouting louder. Thus  with the absolute fluidity prevailing to the right and left of ND  what emerges is that four parties are vying for second place. Simply put  the distance between them is almost within the margin of statistical error  which means that the second could end up fifth and vice versa.The good and the bad for MaximosThe positive for the government has to do with the spectacular  as I’m told  rise in percentages among private-sector employees. The wage increases that appeared at the end of January due to the reduction of tax rates sustain  for a broad segment of society  the image that the government is trying and exhausting every fiscal possibility to provide permanent support measures against high prices. It also shows something else. Institutional announcements and the Constitutional Revision are all well and good  but in the end citizens vote based on their pockets. On the other hand  the expected bad news I mentioned earlier has to do with the picture among the farming population  which is not easily recovering.Instructions to marinersGiven that within the week he will be abroad for several days (Abu Dhabi and New Delhi)  Mitsotakis will use his presence today at the New Democracy organizational unit’s cake-cutting event at a hotel on Syngrou Avenue to deliver political messages and put the party machinery on alert  given that 2026 is a pre-election year. Instructions to mariners  in other words  as mobilizing the machinery works as a rallying force.The social media block at the CabinetNext week the February Cabinet meeting is scheduled  so according to information  the final plan for blocking social media for minors aged 15 and under is expected there. I’m told that at Maximos they have measured the popularity of the measure and its acceptance is overwhelming both among the general public and among ND voters.Investment in IndiaIt was not only Mitsotakis’ doubts about Trump’s Peace Council that led him to decline once again the invitation to Washington  but also the fact that he did not want to cancel his presence at the major artificial intelligence conference organized by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mitsotakis will go to New Delhi on the direct flight from Athens that was inaugurated a few weeks ago  and in general Greece is investing heavily in its relationship with India  given that it is a huge market of 1.4 billion people which  beyond tourism  has much to “offer” in technology  defense cooperation  bilateral trade  etc.The “green” expert of ViolantaThe findings of the investigations into the “Violanta” factory are shocking regarding the ferocity of the explosion and the tragic and unjust way in which the five female workers were led to their deaths. But also regarding the criminal negligence with which the factory ownership is alleged to have treated its business and especially the safety of its employees. However  I want to dwell on a more specific  more political issue. The technical advisor of “Violanta” and expert witness for the ownership  in order to monitor whether the investigating authorities are doing their job correctly  was appointed Professor Michalis Chalaris. In this capacity he appears on journalistic programs and news bulletins. Mr. Chalaris is at the same time a key party official of PASOK. Not coincidental! He has been appointed Secretary of the Climate Crisis and Resilience Sector and advisor on Civil Protection issues to the president. In other words  PASOK in Parliament denounces the government for workplace accidents and at the same time collaborates with private individuals in whose businesses workplace fatalities occur. And then they wonder why the needle is stuck. You will tell me  of course  that Mr. Chalaris offers his services as an expert witness and not as a PASOK official. Correct  but let’s not fool ourselves! We can all imagine what would have happened if his party identity had been “blue.”The old (PASOK member) is different…Panagopoulos proved too tough to die  as yesterday’s double elections at the Athens Labor Center (EKA) and at the GSEE showed. Although he is in the midst of the scandal with the training centers (KEK)  as he is being investigated for embezzlement and money laundering  Panagopoulos managed to be elected a delegate to the GSEE (he received 210 votes out of 300 in the previous elections) and to once again split the trade-union PASOK. And of course to bring the KKE back to first place in both ballots of the EKA and the GSEE. “Anyone who cultivated the sense that Panagopoulos would not be elected to the GSEE is crazy ” a serious PASOK member told me yesterday  hinting at the leak from Charilaou Trikoupi that asked Panagopoulos to show sensitivity and withdraw his ambition to be elected to the GSEE. So what happened in the elections? Panagopoulos  using all the forces and relationships he has built over the years as the lifelong president of the GSEE  merely suffered a slight defeat and once again displayed PASKE as divided. At the EKA  Panagopoulos’ faction gathered nearly 16% and 5 seats and came second behind the KKE (DAS)  while the official Charilaou Trikoupi faction came 5th with 10% and 3 seats. At the GSEE  the KKE won 10 seats  the official “green” faction headed by Bouléros came second with 8 seats  while G. Panagopoulos’ PASKE came third with 5 seats. Many within PASOK place responsibility on the zero reflexes of N. Androulakis. “He should have made much more decisive moves. On the contrary  he let things unfold as they did  so there was no way Panagopoulos would lose ” they say. What kind of moves? For someone to pick up the phone and threaten those running with him that they would be expelled. “There was no party pressure whatsoever  no one even called them  so now Panagopoulos is riding high ” they were saying.Thriassio Freight Center: Goldair wants it  Piraeus Bank is looking aroundThe story of the Thriassio Freight Center (THEK) is old. It begins in 2016 with a tender awarded to ETBA VIPE of Piraeus Bank and to Goldair. It concerns a €300 million investment for the creation of 265 000 sq.m. of logistics facilities on 588 acres of GAIOSE land. The investment  for ten years now  has been through 40 waves. The Troika had disagreements over the terms of the tender  the participation percentages changed  the building terms  etc. Since last December  K. Kallinikos of Goldair—who very much wants this particular investment to proceed—has  as he says  completed negotiations with Piraeus Bank and DFC for a €300 million bond loan  changed the project contractor  and hopes that plans for the vertical corridor will be a lifeline for the project. However  information is that Piraeus Bank does not share Kallinikos’ zeal for THEK. The bank has for two years been trying—unsuccessfully—to sell its stake in the consortium. From Piraeus Bank—it is managed on its behalf by Strinx—they knocked on doors of potential interested parties without even demanding large financial claims  since whoever takes it on will have to invest significant capital  but the approaches made were unsuccessful. So one shareholder shows eagerness for the project and the other is in a somewhat “drag me and let me cry” situation since  for now  it cannot find a willing investor to buy the project.PPC and the…flirtation with UkraineThe destruction of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure from ongoing attacks has pushed the country’s power system to its limits  making the restoration of production units and critical infrastructure absolutely necessary. It was an open secret in energy circles that Greece had contributed to restoring this damage  but confirmation came publicly the day before yesterday from Munich. The Minister of Environment and Energy  Stavros Papastavrou  who participated in the Munich Conference and met  among others  with Ukraine’s Deputy Energy Minister  revealed that old components and equipment of PPC were used to restore destroyed power generation units in Ukraine. Greece is among the few countries that have decommissioned equipment compatible with the Ukrainian system. Transformers  pumps  cabling  and turbine components from PPC units gained new life and operational function  contributing to the restoration of electricity supply. Since the beginning of the war  at least 1 065 attacks on energy infrastructure have been recorded. It is estimated that about 50% of Ukraine’s infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. However  the bigger picture appears to go beyond providing equipment. According to information  PPC is examining the possibility of contributing to covering part of Ukraine’s growing energy needs  particularly during the reconstruction phase after the war. In this context are discussions with the country’s largest private energy company  DTEK  for the joint development of energy storage projects  mainly battery systems. These contacts had been mentioned months ago by the former U.S. ambassador to Greece  Geoffrey Pyatt  noting from the Delphi Forum podium that DTEK is in discussions with PPC for the development of energy projects in Ukraine.Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations: In 10 months  38 new board members appointed from the market to 14 companiesWithout fanfare or celebrations  at the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations  G. Papachristou—who is approaching almost one year in the position of CEO—is doing serious groundwork that creates value in the companies he supervises. Over the past 10 months  38 new board members were appointed in 14 companies in executive and non-executive roles—including Presidents  CEOs  Board members  Audit Committee Chairs  and independent non-executive members. What makes the difference  however  is that these are not appointments of friends and relatives  but executives coming from the market  with experience in various positions in large companies. Papachristou persuaded executives with heavyweight résumés to take positions on the boards  so that the companies are properly managed  move away from the habits of the public sector  gain dynamism  and thus contribute to the transformation of the Organization into a National Investment Fund—which is the central goal. The result of this work and the other actions of the HCAP will soon begin to be visible to citizens as well. OASA  for example  has 951 new vehicles out of a total of 1 322 buses  while in the metro  with an active fleet of 75 trains  14 trains are under refurbishment and another 6–8 are in the process of reintegration by 2026  while by 2027 an additional 8 are expected. At the same time  a new CEO was appointed at OASA; last December the same happened at DETh-HELEXPO; in October “Hellenic Saltworks S.A.” acquired another CEO  etc.The reasons behind Titan’s plunge and OTE’s antibodiesTitan fell more than 9% last Friday. It was the worst daily performance of the past six years  specifically since March 2020  when the coronavirus pandemic broke out. The abrupt correction in the cement company’s share is due to a combination of exogenous factors and technical movements in the market. Among the main causes of the drop are the strong rise of previous months and concern across Europe regarding developments in the pricing of CO2 emissions in the EU. As a result  Titan’s share came under strong pressure. It thus provided a prime opportunity for profit-taking  as it had come from an impressive rally at the start of 2026  reaching new historic highs at the levels of 58–59 euros. Despite the losses  the group remains on a growth trajectory  having recently announced the acquisition of the American Keystone Cement. At the same time  Citi raised the bar to 70 euros  from 56.1 euros previously  seeing TITC up to 78.2 euros in its positive scenario. On the other hand  OTE showed that it has antibodies and remained in positive territory despite the broader sell-off on the Athens Stock Exchange. It has recorded six consecutive upward sessions and has reached the vicinity of 17 euros  which is a two-month high. On Friday it closed at 16.99 euros  having touched even 17.04 euros intraday. After a period of consolidation at the levels of 15.8–16.2 euros  the share produced a healthy reaction  breaking the resistance of 16.8 euros  which attracted new buyers despite the negative climate. At the same time  the share is supported by the strong dividend story for 2026. Analysts (e.g.  Deutsche Bank  Wood) maintain high price targets  up to 21 euros  betting on dividend yield that is expected to be further strengthened.The banking sector in the dockThe now notorious decision of the Plenary of the Supreme Court regarding the capitalization of interest on loans under the Katseli Law has caused much greater noise (and distrust) abroad than within the country. The decision followed other recent surprise judicial and administrative decisions concerning the taxation of profits of energy companies and refineries  sectors that also attract the investment interest of foreign institutions. All this was reflected in the pressures that appeared on the Stock Exchange last week. The day after tomorrow  early in the morning  it will be the turn of the Bank of Cyprus to announce results and—above all—the remainder of the dividend it intends to distribute. From the dividend announcement it will also be seen the degree of freedom the Bank has achieved from the restrictions and directions of Frankfurt.FarewellsThere isn’t much that needs to be said about the career of Giorgos Gerardos. He played a significant role in shaping what retail and B2B trade look like in Greece today—especially in electronics. And he was a visionary. When he spoke about omnichannel sales back in the 1990s  the term didn’t even exist internationally. A tough negotiator  straightforward with everyone and never one to mince words  with a sense of humor and a workaholic nature  he managed to turn a tiny shop of just over 20 sq.m. on Stournari Street into a major retail chain  and himself into the last Greek entrepreneur standing in the sector. Last Saturday  at his final farewell  Kefalari Square outside the Church of the Transfiguration was packed. Among those present was the entire “competition.” Everyone came to pay their respects  to say a warm word  and to share an interesting or funny story about the deceased. That too was one of Giorgos Gerardos’s achievements: he earned the respect of the entire market. Present were Panos Germanos; Andreas Athanasopoulos and the entire management of Olympia Group and Public; the chairman of PPC’s board and deputy CEO G. Karakousis with the entire management of Kotsovolos; and of course many people from the broader retail sector and beyond—Makis Sklavenitis  Nikos Moustakas  Vassilis Furlis  among others. Everyone agreed that  in one way or another  the death of Giorgos Gerardos marks the end of an era.It will take Koustas two years to order LNG carriersDanaos  known for its large containership fleet and its activity in dry bulk shipping  is moving dynamically into a new vessel category with long-term prospects. In a recent conference call with analysts  Giannis Koustas revealed that the company will need about two years to order LNG carriers for the new LNG project in Alaska  in which it has invested $50 million through its partnership with developer Glenfarne Group. The number of vessels is estimated at between 6 and 10  depending on the route to Far East markets  and their use is expected to last about 20 years. The project is scheduled for completion in 2030 and will include an LNG export terminal capable of shipping up to 20 million tons annually  with 11 million tons already committed by buyers in Japan  South Korea  Taiwan  and Thailand. Danaos  which a few years ago began its first diversification away from containerships with the purchase of secondhand capesize bulkers  has now announced an order for two Newcastlemax newbuild bulkers  which will increase its fleet to 13 capesizes upon delivery in 2028. Koustas explained that the choice of newbuilding rather than secondhand vessels was a matter of value and strategic positioning in the dry bulk spot market  with prospects for future long-term charters linked to indices. At the same time  the company continues to invest in its core containership business: with new orders for six 1 800 teu feeders and four 5 300 teu mid-sized vessels  the orderbook now stands at 27 ships  four of which have 10-year long-term charters  providing revenue visibility of $4.3 billion through the end of 2025. In practice  Danaos confirms its intention not to limit itself to containers and to seize opportunities in both LNG and dry bulk  while maintaining a strong presence in its traditional market.Pappas on fire – closing deals and renewing the fleetThe US-listed Star Bulk  led by Petros Pappas  continues consistently with a strategy that resembles portfolio management more than traditional shipping. The sale of the 175 900 dwt capesize Star Scarlett (2014) for around $36 million fits into a broader divestment program that takes advantage of high valuations in the secondhand market. The speed at which the deal closed shows that demand for large bulkers in Asia remains active. Since the beginning of 2023  the company has sold 42 vessels  with total gross proceeds estimated at $700 million  mostly to Chinese interests. These funds are being directed along two axes: financing newbuildings and returning capital to shareholders. The message to Wall Street is clear—discipline in capital allocation and active fleet management. Despite the sales  Star Bulk remains the largest listed bulker owner in the US  with about 140 cargo vessels including those under construction. At the same time  the company has shifted toward kamsarmax vessels. It has eight of this type under construction in China  with deliveries within the year. The choice signals positioning in a more flexible size segment  with a better balance of risk and employment across different trades. In a market where capesize values are at multi-year highs  the moves do not suggest aggressiveness but methodical execution.Emissions increase destinations: Minoan showed the way  Attica followsAt first glance  adding an intermediate stop on the Piraeus–Heraklion route looks like a simple commercial move. But nothing is random when it comes to Crete’s “golden” line. Minoan Lines led the way on February 1  2024  adding Milos as an intermediate destination. This year  Attica Group is following its competitor by requesting a call at Serifos starting today  Monday 16/2/2026. Coincidentally—so to speak—the Coastal Shipping Council also meets today. The aim is for both companies to save money by restructuring costs within the EU Emissions Trading System. Crete  as the only Greek island with more than 200 000 inhabitants  is at the center of these charges  while all other Greek islands are exempt due to having populations below 200 000. The cost of emissions allowances can be significant—hundreds of thousands to millions of euros per ship per year  depending on consumption and carbon prices. However  when a vessel includes an intermediate stop at a smaller island such as Serifos or Milos  a technically different routing structure is created and the voyage falls outside the EU-ETS. A window with a view.Chang’s “Golden Panda”Among the various companies established in recent days  one stood out to me for its interesting name: “Golden Panda Investments.” The company  which began operations last Friday  is based in Palaio Faliro on Agiou Alexandrou Street and aims at real estate trading  construction activities  and holding company operations. Its initial share capital is €700 000  divided into 700 000 company shares of €1 nominal value  contributed by Junxiang Zhang. However  the management of the company was assigned to Orestis Phaedon Chang  known at least to those who have long followed Survivor. Orestis Chang  born and raised in Thessaloniki to Chinese parents  participated in the popular reality show in 2017 and in Nomads in 2018. He studied Agricultural Development and Management of Agricultural Enterprises  later worked as a freelance Chinese-language translator  and also had a stint in entertainment with roles in the series IQ160 and the film Eureka: Don’t Disturb My Circles. Now he has decided to get involved in domestic real estate  so we wish him to prove a true… survivor.ATHEX on the road to EuronextThe day after tomorrow afternoon  after the close of the session  ATHEX will announce its financial results for fiscal year 2025. The figures are expected to confirm—and even exceed—the upward trend seen in the nine-month results. Everyone now knows that trading volume  transaction value  and corporate actions on the Athens Stock Exchange in the second half of 2025 were at least 50% higher than in 2024. Especially in the Derivatives Market during October–November–December  a turnover record was set with thousands of open contracts. Wednesday’s announcement will be the last “purely Greek” results announcement. From here on  ATHEX enters the Euronext framework—a pan-European exchange group with 1 900 listed companies and a market capitalization of €6.8 trillion. For the Greek market  the upcoming announcements mark the end of an era.Greece–UAE memorandum in Abu DhabiTomorrow  Tuesday 17 February in Abu Dhabi  Deputy Foreign Minister Haris Theocharis and H.E. Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber  Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the United Arab Emirates  will sign a Memorandum of Cooperation covering AI data centers  health  education  and defense. The framework agreement provides for project mapping  exchange of know-how  investment missions  and fast-track licensing  so that the first infrastructure projects can begin within 2026. Information suggests there is a clear and tight timetable. Tomorrow’s signing is considered a milestone: it opens the way for an “AI gigafactory” in Greece and gives the UAE what the tech market calls one of its strongest anchor tenancies in the European Union. Discussions began last May. Tomorrow  words turn into signatures.China is now a major exporter of capitalAnalyst Torsten Slok of Apollo revealed a major truth that changes the global economic discussion. China now invests more abroad than it receives in foreign capital inflows. For more than 35 years  China was the ultimate destination for foreign direct investment. Multinationals built factories  tech giants constructed infrastructure  financial institutions opened offices in Shanghai. The Chinese model was based on inflows of foreign know-how and capital to develop its productive base. Today  the game has reversed. Chinese companies are buying European infrastructure  ports in Africa  mines in Latin America  and technology firms in Southeast Asia. The Belt and Road Initiative has turned China into a global-scale lender and investor. Two conclusions emerge. First  China has “matured” and may have lost part of its attractiveness as an investment destination. Second  capital exports reflect Beijing’s effort to secure access to raw materials  technology  and geopolitical influence in an era of intensifying competition with the West.Trump is rushing to cut rates and the dollar  US debt swellsA towering mountain of debt: bonds totaling $9.6 trillion mature over the next 12 months  according to Bank of America. This amount is double what was maturing before the 2020 crisis. The US Treasury Secretary must either refinance this debt by issuing new bonds or find a way to repay it. Both options carry a cost. Refinancing in an environment of higher interest rates than in the past means increased debt-servicing costs. The US fiscal deficit is already approaching 7% of GDP. Each additional percentage point of interest translates into tens of billions of dollars in extra annual spending. Understandably  President Trump is exerting intense pressure on the Fed to cut dollar interest rates  even if this affects the dollar’s exchange rate. Attention now turns to the publication of the Fed minutes next Thursday  which will reveal the degree of consensus among central bank members regarding the path of rates during the year. So far (Presidents’ Day and a US holiday)  markets are betting only on a quarter-point cut by year-end  with a more than 50% chance that the Fed Funds rate will close the year at 2.75%–3%  down from the current 3.5%–3.75%. In the meantime  the time horizon is such that many changes may occur within the Fed’s leadership.,neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,negative,0.04,0.18,0.78,True,English,"['Fresh polls', 'President Maria', 'green adviser', 'Piraeus Bank', 'ND', 'ups', 'downs', 'Alexis', 'Violanta', 'Goldair', 'Thriassio', 'Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi', 'major artificial intelligence conference', 'three-day Clean Monday weekend', 'New Democracy organizational unit', 'potential voting intention', 'permanent support measures', 'five female workers', 'Civil Protection issues', 'slight upward course', 'Professor Michalis Chalaris', 'key party official', 'social media block', 'February Cabinet meeting', 'next Monday', 'New Delhi', 'slight fatigue', 'Mr. Chalaris', 'southerly wind', 'African dust', 'winter resorts', 'Fresh polls', '2nd place', 'current affairs', 'measurement data', 'mediocre performances', 'specific audience', 'two “parties', 'vote estimation', 'absolute fluidity', 'four parties', 'second place', 'statistical error', 'wage increases', 'tax rates', 'broad segment', 'fiscal possibility', 'high prices', 'Institutional announcements', 'Constitutional Revision', 'other hand', 'bad news', 'farming population', 'several days', 'Abu Dhabi', 'cake-cutting event', 'Syngrou Avenue', 'political messages', 'party machinery', 'other words', 'rallying force', 'final plan', 'general public', 'Peace Council', 'direct flight', 'huge market', '1.4 billion people', 'defense cooperation', 'bilateral trade', 'green” expert', 'unjust way', 'criminal negligence', 'political issue', 'expert witness', 'investigating authorities', 'journalistic programs', 'news bulletins', 'same time', 'Climate Crisis', 'Resilience Sector', 'Parliament denounces', 'President Maria', 'private-sector employees', 'election year', 'technical advisor', 'ND voters', 'Mitsotakis’ doubts', 'factory ownership', 'Newsroom', 'atmosphere', 'yesterday', 'meantime', 'weather', 'meteorologists', 'sunshine', 'case', 'one', 'bookings', 'carnivals', 'Galaxidi', 'Karystianou', 'Tsipras', '4 battle', 'surveys', 'picture', 'source', 'trend', 'government', 'beginning', 'point', 'others', 'signs', 'popularity', 'stability', 'indication', 'Alexis', 'neck', 'Nikos', 'Zoitsa', 'right', 'left', 'distance', 'margin', 'Maximos', 'percentages', 'January', 'reduction', 'society', 'image', 'something', 'citizens', 'pockets', 'Instructions', 'mariners', 'presence', 'hotel', 'alert', 'information', 'minors', 'acceptance', 'Investment', 'Trump', 'invitation', 'Washington', 'Athens', 'Greece', 'relationship', 'tourism', 'technology', 'Violanta', 'findings', 'investigations', 'ferocity', 'explosion', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'business', 'safety', 'order', 'job', 'capacity', 'PASOK', 'Secretary']",2026-02-16,2026-02-17,en.protothema.gr
