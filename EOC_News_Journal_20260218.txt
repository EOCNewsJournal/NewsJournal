R&D expenses  mainly related to the development of lanifibranor in MASH  amounted to €86.9 million in 2025  down 4% from €90.9 million in 2024. The increase in net cash used in operating activities is mainly related to the net cash impact of the strategic pipeline prioritization plan for the Company's activities implemented in the first half of 2025  lower revenues under the licensing agreement with Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd. (“CTTQ”)  and an increase in general and administrative expenses.Net cash used in investing activities amounted to (€133.2) million in 2025  mainly related to the subscription of new short-term deposits2 during the period  compared with €8.7 million generated in 2024.Net cash generated by financing activities amounted to €241.1 million in 2025  compared to €145.6 million in 2024. This positive cash flow is mainly due to the receipt of (i) gross proceeds of €115.6 million (net proceeds of €108.0 million) from the second tranche5 in May 2025 of the structured financing announced by the Company in October 2024 (the “Structured Financing”)  and (ii) gross proceeds of $172.5 million (net proceeds of €139.3 million) from the public offering in the United States in November 2025.In 2025  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.5) million  compared to a positive effect of €1.2 million in 2024  due to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate.Given its current cost structure and projected expenses  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents  and short-term deposits  should enable it to finance its operations until the middle of the first quarter of 2027. Assuming the potential exercise in full of the Tranche 3 warrants issued in the Structured Financing for proceeds of up to €116.0 million  the Company estimates that such potential additional proceeds would enable it to finance its activities until the middle of the third quarter of 20276.RevenuesThe Company's revenues in 2025 amounted to €4.5 million  compared to €9.2 million generated in 2024.Revenues recorded by the Company in 2025 consist mainly of the $10 million gross proceeds (net proceeds of €8.6 million) milestone payment invoiced to CTTQ and the $5 million (€4.3 million) credit notes recognized under the license agreement with CTTQ following the closing of the second tranche of the Structured Financing in May 2025.

Following the Company’s IPO on the NYSE in October 2021  Wendel has maintained its ownership unchanged.Laurent Mignon  Wendel Group CEO  commented: “Wendel has been IHS’s partner for more than a decade and has supported its development. The combination of MTN and IHS is an industrial project that makes sense  and which Wendel fully supports by tendering its shares to MTN’s offer. This disposal enables Wendel to continue refocusing its strategy on direct investments in controlled  unlisted companies located in Europe and North America.Furthermore  this transaction is fully aligned with the active portfolio rotation strategy presented at the Investor Day in December 2025 and already recently illustrated by the sale of Stahl to Henkel  announced on February 4. Together  these two transactions will generate approximately €1.65 billion and give Wendel full flexibility to achieve its long-term value creation objectives through investments in private assets  the development of Wendel Investment Managers (WIM)  and a higher return to shareholders  notably with the launch —following the announcement of our annual results— of a share buyback program representing nearly 9% of the share capital.”Sam Darwish  IHS Towers Chairman and CEO: “Today’s announcement creates a compelling opportunity that provides certainty and immediate returns for our shareholders  enabling them to crystallize the significant value generated during our strategic review. The proposed transaction deepens our long-standing partnership with MTN  as it combines Africa’s largest mobile network operator with one of its largest digital infrastructure platforms  and underscores the strong connection between IHS Towers and the African continent.I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues  customers and partners for their support over the past 25 years  as IHS Towers has grown from a single tower in one market to an eleven-country portfolio of approximately 40 000 towers at its peak.”Ralph Mupita  Group President and CEO  MTN  commented: “This proposed transaction is a pivotal step in further strengthening MTN Group’s strategic and financial position for a future where digital infrastructure will become ever more essential to Africa’s growth and development. This transaction gives us a unique opportunity to buy back our towers and strengthen our ability to be partners for progress to the nation states in which we operate. For IHS customers and partners across the continent  we commit to continuing high standards of service and the right governance of what is the largest standalone and integrated tower company in Africa  enabled by the excellent people within IHS.”AgendaThursday  February 26  2026Full-Year 2025 Results – Publication of NAV as of December 31  2025  and Full-Year consolidated financial statements (before-market release)Thursday  April 23  2026Q1 2026 Trading update – Publication of NAV as of March 31  2026 (before-market release)Thursday  May 21  2026Annual General MeetingThursday  July 30  2026H1 2026 results – Publication of NAV as of June 30  2026  and condensed Half-Year consolidated financial statements (before-market release)About WendelWendel is one of Europe’s leading listed investment firms.

This strategic collaboration enables real-time tracking and status assignment of e-commerce items and establishes a foundation for a responsive and agile retail operation  by enhancing inventory accuracy and improving the Click & Collect (BOPIS) customer experience.With more than 1 300 stores  C&A is a European omnichannel fashion retailer. The Click & Collect (BOPIS) service  allowing customers to order online and pick up in-store  is an important part of its customer experience. However  this model can hold operational challenges  e.g.  if in-store cycle counts mistakenly include items reserved for pickup if item status isn’t accurately assigned.To improve this process  C&A deployed Nedap’s Inventory Engine in its e-commerce warehouses. RFID-enabled read points at dispatch locations automatically scan outbound items and assign the correct status. This information is synced in real time  ensuring that Click & Collect items are excluded from store inventory counts.With the implementation of this solution  inventory data accuracy has improved  while operational disruptions in stores have been reduced. The data captured and processed through Nedap’s Inventory Engine supports teams in enhancing the unified shopping experience for consumers. The technology provides a reliable and scalable foundation that aligns with ongoing business growth.“In modern retail  inventory is dynamic and constantly changing ” says Tom Vieweger  RFID Business Expert at Nedap. “Retailers need an architecture that reflects real-time availability  including items reserved for e-commerce pickups. Nedap’s Inventory Engine provides this real-time item-level view  enabling C&A to reduce complexity  fulfill online orders confidently  and deliver the seamless shopping experience consumers expect.”Key Benefits:For Stores: Accurate and reliable inventory counts. Reserved e-commerce items are excluded from store stock  avoiding miscounts.For Logistics: Rapid Deployment with plug-and-play hardware like Nedap’s RFID Arch and RFID Plate  implementation is fast and requires no complex integration.The project launched in late 2024 and was operational within weeks. C&A is now scaling the solution across its broader omnichannel infrastructure.How Nedap impacts retailNedap empowers retailers to turn inventory movements into real-time insight and real-world results.

The operation took place in November at the Los Llanos air base near Albacete in Spain  where TLP training programs are implemented. These training programs provide fighter pilots with highly realistic simulated environments  designed to replicate real-world operational conditions.This project illustrates Eviden's commitment to providing solutions tailored to the operational needs of NATO's armed forces in high-intensity environments. Designed by Avantix  the ARPEGE system has been in operation since 2022  with the French Electronic Warfare Polygon component1 and is actively used at NATO's Los Llanos training air base. The ARPEGE system consists of a central command post and remote light vehicles  equipped with radar signal generators and tracking antennas. Together  they enable the simulation of radar threats  illuminating aircraft in flight. During training flights  these simulated radar emissions replicate real-world threat conditions  triggering the aircraft's self-protection systems. Fighter pilots are assessed based on their responses  including evasive maneuvers  implementation of countermeasures such as decoying or jamming  or the execution of simulated air-to-ground attacks.This mobile and flexible solution can be quickly deployed and operated as a network  interconnecting multiple trucks to the operations control center. Its modular design allows it to be tailored to the diverse needs of the forces across various training areas.ARPEGE is part of Avantix’s Mobile Radar Threat Simulator (MRTS) portfolio  a range of mobile radar threat simulation solutions. MRTS is a scalable range designed to adapt to next-generation radar signals and systems  to protect against emerging threats. The MRTS solutions enable the implementation of complex and highly realistic operational scenarios  tailored to the specific training requirements of air forces.Bernard Payer  managing director  Eviden  mission critical systems and president of Avantix  said: ""With this ARPEGE system deployed as part of this exercise  we are particularly proud to put our expertise in the electromagnetic spectrum at the service of NATO fighter pilots’ operational excellence.""©Eviden***About EvidenEviden is the Atos Group brand for hardware and software products with c. € 1 billion in revenue  operating in 36 countries and comprising four business units: advanced computing  cybersecurity products  mission-critical systems and vision AI.

To date  the outstanding amount of the Bonds still in circulation totals €59.1 million euros (the ‘Outstanding Amount of the Bonds’).On 24 November 2025  the Company announced that it had obtained a refinancing agreement for the Outstanding Bonds from a banking pool composed of leading French banks for a total amount of €43 million through the implementation of a credit contract  repayable over a period of 6 years (the ""Partial Refinancing""). Given the Partial Refinancing  the balance of the Outstanding Bonds  not refinanced  amounted to a total of approximately €16.1 million (the ""Non-Refinanced Residual Balance"").In this regard  on 5 December 2025  the Company announced it would initiate discussions with the bondholders.The general meeting of bondholders held on 2 February 2026  approved all proposed amendments to the terms of the Bonds by a very large majority. The arrangement notably provides for a partial repayment of €75 000 per Bond (i.e.  a total amount of approximately €43 million - the ""Partial Repayment"")  reducing the unit nominal amount of each Bond from €100 000 to €28 000; the Maturity Date of the Non-Refinanced Residual Balance (€16.1 million) is  for its part  postponed to 19 August 2032.On 13 February 2026  late in the afternoon  i.e.  four business days before the Maturity Date  the banking pool informed the Company of its refusal to honor the drawdown notice that had been sent to it by the Company in connection with the Refinancing  claiming that it could invoke a breach by the Company for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. The Company strongly disputes this legal analysis of the contract and reserves all its rights in this regard.As a direct consequence of this unexpected refusal by the banking pool  the Company is currently unable to meet the Partial Repayment on the Maturity Date.In light of this situation  the Company is considering requesting a deferral of the Partial Repayment due date from the Bondholders. The Company is also examining the possibility of resorting to procedures designed to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the commercial court.The Board of Directors and Executive Management are fully committed to securing a solution that aligns with the interests of the Company  its employees  partners  and investors; the Company is committed to informing the market of any significant developments in this situation as soon as possible.IFRS REVENUE 2024-25: €288 MHEADCOUNTMore than 1 300 employeesINTERNATIONAL36 subsidiaries and a distribution network in over 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben is a European player in video game publishing  the design and distribution of mobile and gaming accessories  as well as audio-video products.

Additionally  the Research and Innovation tax credits  which were recognized in operating income until 2024  are presented in “Corporate income tax” in 2025 (and excluded from Operating income/(loss)). Finally  all patent license fees are included in “Other operating expenses” in 2025. To enable comparison between financial years  a pro forma consolidated income statement has been prepared to present the 2024 financial year in accordance with the presentation rules adopted in 2025. Details of the reclassifications made are provided in the appendix to this press release.The Board of Directors of Spineway  meeting on February 17  2026 under the chairmanship of Stéphane Le Roux  approved the financial statements for the year ended December 31  2025.Revenue growthThe Spineway Group  a specialist in innovative implants for the treatment of severe spine disorders  closed the 2025 financial year having consolidated its geographic diversification  launched its ESP1 disc prosthesis production line  and continued its regulatory investments. Despite delays in approvals in Latin America  delays in the awarding of tenders in Asia  and supply chain tensions  annual revenue amounted to €12.4 million  up 4%.Improved resultsGross margin reached €8.6 million in 2025  representing 69.6% of revenue  an increase of 0.6 percentage points year on year. Net operating expenses remained under control  increasing by 5% (pro forma* data)  in line with revenue growth and due to continued high regulatory expenses (approval  clinical studies  etc.)  which are expected to increase further in 2026. Consequently  the operating loss was stable at €2.1 million  compared with €2 million in 2024 (pro forma* data).The bond financing agreement with Negma expired in May 2025 without penalty  significantly reducing net financial expense to €2.1 million. Research and innovation tax credits returned to a normal level of €149k after reaching an exceptional level in 2024.As a result  net income improved by €1.6 million year on year to a net loss of €2.2 million.Cash flow preservedWith external financing (bond issues) limited to €0.4 million in 2025  compared with €6.8 million in 2024  Spineway’s cash position amounted to €3.5 million in the year ended December 31  2025  representing cash consumption of just €1 million for the financial year.

Positive results from the RELIEVE UCCD long-term extension (LTE) study (clinical study identifier: NCT05668013) of duvakitug  an investigational human monoclonal antibody targeting TL1A  showed durable clinical and endoscopic efficacy maintained over 44 weeks in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) that initially responded to the induction phase. RELIEVE UCCD LTE is a double-blind randomized study evaluating the long-term efficacy  safety  and tolerability of duvakitug in UC and CD  the two most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).These longer duration data reinforce the efficacy from the RELIEVE UCCD phase 2b induction study (clinical study identifier: NCT05499130)  which demonstrated that patients achieved clinically meaningful response with duvakitug compared to placebo at week 14.""These results reinforce duvakitug's potential as a leading TL1A therapy and an important advancement in inflammatory bowel disease treatment with durable efficacy maintained for nearly one year in patients living with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease "" said Houman Ashrafian  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development  Sanofi. ""With phase 3 studies underway  we're committed to advancing duvakitug for patients who need new options  and it remains a key opportunity in our pipeline.""The study enrolled 130 patients who responded to duvakitug in the RELIEVE UCCD induction study and entered a 44-week maintenance period. Patients were re-randomized to receive either a 450 mg or 900 mg subcutaneous dose of duvakitug every four weeks for up to a total of 58 weeks of exposure. At week 44 of the maintenance period:UC: 58% (900 mg) and 47% (450 mg) of patients treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per the modified Mayo score (mMS).58% (900 mg) and 47% (450 mg) of patients treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission per the modified Mayo score (mMS). CD: 55% (900 mg) and 41% (450 mg) of patients treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of endoscopic response as defined by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD).55% (900 mg) and 41% (450 mg) of patients treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of endoscopic response as defined by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). In both UC and CD  consistent benefits were observed across additional efficacy endpoints.Both doses of duvakitug were well tolerated. The most frequent observed adverse events (≥5% of all patients) with pooled duvakitug doses were upper respiratory tract infection  nasopharyngitis  Crohn’s disease  and hypertension and were consistent with the RELIEVE UCCD phase 2b induction study. Detailed results from the study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.“One of the persistent challenges in treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease isn’t just achieving an initial response  but sustaining it ” said Eric Hughes  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer  Teva. “These phase 2b results further reinforce TL1A as a compelling target and clearly strengthen the case that duvakitug has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy. They also provide further evidence to support additional indications we anticipate announcing this year  with the goal of bringing meaningful innovation to patients.”About IBDIBD is an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Globally  approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD have been identified  with incidence rising in several regions. The two main types of IBD are UC and CD  which are characterized by repetitive cycles of relapses and remission. Common symptoms of both conditions include persistent diarrhea  rectal bleeding  abdominal pain  loss of appetite  and weight loss.Prolonged inflammation can lead to damage within the GI tract  including fibrosis  a common complication of IBD characterized by an excessive accumulation of scar tissue in the intestinal wall  which may cause narrowing and obstruction.Currently  there is no cure for IBD. The goal of current treatment is to induce and maintain remission and prevent flares.About the RELIEVE UCCD phase 2b programThe RELIEVE UCCD program is comprised of an induction study and a long-term extension.RELIEVE UCCD: A 14-week phase 2b  randomized  double-blinded  dose-ranging induction study to evaluate the efficacy  safety  pharmacokinetics  and tolerability of duvakitug in adults with moderate-to-severe UC or CD. The study was an innovative and efficient basket study design allowing the inclusion of patients with either UC or CD. It is the first and only randomized  blinded and placebo-controlled phase 2 study to investigate the impact of TL1A in CD.RELIEVE UCCD LTE: An ongoing study to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of duvakitug. Patients who received duvakitug  completed the 14-week induction study  and were responders  entered a 44-week double-blind maintenance period and were re-randomized to receive either 450 mg or 900 mg of subcutaneous duvakitug every four weeks. Patients who completed the 44-week maintenance period may continue to receive duvakitug in an open-label extension.Primary efficacy endpoints for both the 14-week induction study and the 44-week maintenance period are clinical remission (as defined by mMS) in the UC cohort or endoscopic response (as defined by SES-CD) in the CD cohort. The study includes sites in the US  Europe  Israel  and Asia.About duvakitugDuvakitug  a human monoclonal antibody targeting TL1A  is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of UC and CD. TL1A signaling is believed to amplify inflammation and drive fibrosis associated with IBD through binding to its receptor  DR3. Duvakitug preferentially inhibits TL1A-DR3 signaling over DcR3 (decoy receptor 3) binding  with the potential to reduce inflammation and fibrosis.The safety and efficacy of duvakitug have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority.About the Teva and Sanofi collaborationTeva and Sanofi are collaborating to co-develop and co-commercialize duvakitug for the treatment of UC and CD. Each company will equally share the development costs globally  and the net profits and losses in major markets  with other markets subject to a royalty arrangement. Sanofi is leading the phase 3 clinical development program. Teva will lead commercialization of the product in Europe  Israel  and specified other countries  and Sanofi will lead commercialization in North America  Japan  other parts of Asia  and the rest of the world.About TevaTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

We focus on underlying performance and we focus on volume growth ” he told the Irish Independent.Kerry’s Irish stock-market listed peers that have very large dollar exposures  like CRH and Flutter  and US investors have moved either their primary listing or their reporting currency to the US and the dollar in recent years.In both cases  they have benefited from higher US share valuations and less currency volatility. Kerry is not interested in following that trend  Mr Scanlon said.""We are a European company  we are an Irish company  first and foremost ” he said.Kerry sells into 150 markets and currency volatility is inevitable in such a global business  he pointed out.""Our job is try to navigate that as best we can ” he said.Kerry does that by largely manufacturing and selling within currency areas – de-risking the ‘geographic footprint’ of the business  he said.It means there are few concerns around the potential impact of tariffs  he said.The US political climate – specifically the Make America Healthy Again drive – is throwing up growth opportunities for Kerry Group’s taste and ingredients business  he said.A policy-driven shift in US food manufacturing away from high-sugar  high-salt and high saturated fats recipes is triggering large scale re-formulation of food products with Kerry well placed to provide healthier taste alternatives  he said. Kerry’s US snacks and bakery lines have seen significant growth in a flat or a declining market  he said.A possible US adoption of food ‘traffic light labelling’ systems already seen in the UK and some European markets could accelerate that trend  he thinks.The other major food trend impacting Kerry is the mass use of Ozempic and other GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.""It is hard to measure the impact but it is there ” Mr Scanlon said.The big impact is that consumers who use those drugs eat less  but it also throws up new nutritional needs  he said.Kerry Group is working with clients to develop high protein  small portion  products and other supplements and beverages tailored around GLP-1 use  he said.Kerry’s shares in Dublin were down sharply in early trading today – falling 3.8pc to €75.50 a share  the biggest faller in a generally weak start for shares on Dublin’s Euronext.Commenting on the results themselves  Mr Scanlon said it had been a year of strong end-market volume outperformance and margin expansion.“Volume growth was driven by a strong performance in the Americas throughout the year. This was led by foodservice innovation and increased nutritional renovation across a broad range of customers  given our positioning as a leader in sustainable nutrition  with customers looking to address nutrition  taste  cost or sustainability aspects ” he said.In 2026  Kerry is “well positioned for strong market outperformance”  he said.""We expect to deliver continued volume growth and margin expansion  resulting in constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 6pc to 10pc.”Even so  Kerry said results for food and beverage markets in the year reflected “soft overall consumer demand  given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty”.Preliminary full-year results for 2025 record revenue of €6.758bn  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of €1.208bn and Ebitda margin up +80bps to 17.9pc.Adjusted earnings per share rose 7.5pc to 481.5 cent. The business generated free cash flow of €643m reflecting 81pc cash conversion.Kerry announced a new chair  Dubliner Fiona Dawson  a 33-year veteran of Mars International and non-executive director at Marks & Spencer  Reckitt and Lego. She replaces the retiring Tom Moran.He is due to retire at the end of the annual general meeting on April 30. Ms Dawson has been a non-executive director at Kerry Group since 2022.The group has launched a new €300m share buyback programme and a final dividend of 98 cent per share.Davy Stockbroker’s Cathal Kenny said Kerry Group had delivered a solid 2025 result with good progress on volume and margin  against a subdued demand environment.“Volume growth was ahead of end-markets  driven by strong execution in the foodservice channel. EPS was in line. The 2026 outlook calls for 6-10pc constant currency EPS growth with FX a c.4pc headwind. Adjusting for FX  we anticipate an EPS forecast in the zone of 501c (from 514c) ” he said.",negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,negative,0.01,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['Kerry shares', 'revenue decline', 'results', 'food ‘traffic light labelling’ systems', 'new €300m share buyback programme', 'other major food trend impacting', 'high saturated fats recipes', 'soft overall consumer demand', 'Irish stock-market listed peers', 'strong end-market volume outperformance', 'lower-margin Irish dairy business', 'other GLP-1 weight-loss drugs', 'higher US share valuations', 'large scale re-formulation', 'free cash flow', '81pc cash conversion', 'retiring Tom Moran', 'annual general meeting', 'new nutritional needs', 'strong market outperformance', 'US food manufacturing', 'other currency swings', 'Dubliner Fiona Dawson', 'US political climate', 'possible US adoption', 'key share listing', 'continued volume growth', 'large dollar exposures', 'healthier taste alternatives', 'first full year', 'less currency volatility', 'Preliminary full-year results', 'other supplements', 'new chair', 'Irish Independent', 'GLP-1 use', 'strong performance', 'food products', 'share growth', 'primary listing', 'Irish company', 'nutritional renovation', 'Ms Dawson', 'US investors', 'US snacks', 'biggest market', 'declining market', 'growth opportunities', 'significant growth', 'financial hedging', 'Edmond Scanlon', '2.5pc decline', 'significant part', 'North America', 'sharp drop', 'Mr Scanlon', 'financial tools', 'underlying performance', 'reporting currency', 'recent years', 'global business', 'currency areas', 'geographic footprint', 'America Healthy', 'ingredients business', 'policy-driven shift', 'high-sugar, high-salt', 'bakery lines', 'mass use', 'small portion', 'early trading', 'biggest faller', 'weak start', 'margin expansion', 'foodservice innovation', 'broad range', 'sustainability aspects', 'constant currency', 'geopolitical uncertainty', '33-year veteran', 'executive director', 'final dividend', 'Davy Stockbroker', 'Cathal Kenny', 'weakening dollar', 'weaker dollar', 'potential impact', 'European markets', 'big impact', 'beverage markets', 'Sales volumes', 'last year', 'European company', 'sustainable nutrition', '2025 record revenue', 'Ebitda margin', 'Kerry Co-op', 'Adjusted earnings', 'Kerry Group', '150 markets', 'effect', 'operations', 'likes', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'Shares', 'Tuesday', 'margins', 'EPS', 'USA', 'parity', 'currencies', 'cases', 'job', 'concerns', 'tariffs', 'flat', 'UK', 'Ozempic', 'consumers', 'clients', 'beverages', 'Euronext', 'Americas', 'customers', 'positioning', 'leader', 'cost', '6pc', '10pc', 'macroeconomic', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '17.9pc', 'Mars', 'International', 'Marks', 'Spencer', 'Reckitt', 'Lego', 'April', '98 cent', '1.5']",2026-02-17,2026-02-18,independent.ie

Kerry’s US snacks and bakery lines have seen significant growth in a flat or a declining market  he said.A possible US adoption of food ‘traffic light labelling’ systems already seen in the UK and some European markets could accelerate that trend  he thinks.The other major food trend impacting Kerry is the mass use of Ozempic and other GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.""It is hard to measure the impact but it is there ” Mr Scanlon said.The big impact is that consumers who use those drugs eat less  but it also throws up new nutritional needs  he said.Kerry Group is working with clients to develop high protein  small portion  products and other supplements and beverages tailored around GLP-1 use  he said.Kerry’s shares in Dublin were down sharply in early trading today – falling 3.8pc to €75.50 a share  the biggest faller in a generally weak start for shares on Dublin’s Euronext.Commenting on the results themselves  Mr Scanlon said it had been a year of strong end-market volume outperformance and margin expansion.“Volume growth was driven by a strong performance in the Americas throughout the year. This was led by foodservice innovation and increased nutritional renovation across a broad range of customers  given our positioning as a leader in sustainable nutrition  with customers looking to address nutrition  taste  cost or sustainability aspects ” he said.In 2026  Kerry is “well positioned for strong market outperformance”  he said.""We expect to deliver continued volume growth and margin expansion  resulting in constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 6pc to 10pc.”Even so  Kerry said results for food and beverage markets in the year reflected “soft overall consumer demand  given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty”.Preliminary full-year results for 2025 record revenue of €6.758bn  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of €1.208bn and Ebitda margin up +80bps to 17.9pc.Adjusted earnings per share rose 7.5pc to 481.5 cent. The business generated free cash flow of €643m reflecting 81pc cash conversion.Kerry announced a new chair  Dubliner Fiona Dawson  a 33-year veteran of Mars International and non-executive director at Marks & Spencer  Reckitt and Lego. She replaces the retiring Tom Moran.He is due to retire at the end of the annual general meeting on April 30. Ms Dawson has been a non-executive director at Kerry Group since 2022.The group has launched a new €300m share buyback programme and a final dividend of 98 cent per share.Davy Stockbroker’s Cathal Kenny said Kerry Group had delivered a solid 2025 result with good progress on volume and margin  against a subdued demand environment.“Volume growth was ahead of end-markets  driven by strong execution in the foodservice channel. EPS was in line. The 2026 outlook calls for 6-10pc constant currency EPS growth with FX a c.4pc headwind. Adjusting for FX  we anticipate an EPS forecast in the zone of 501c (from 514c) ” he said.",negative,0.03,0.47,0.5,negative,0.01,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['Kerry shares', 'dollar', 'revenue', 'food ‘traffic light labelling’ systems', 'new €300m share buyback programme', 'other major food trend impacting', 'high saturated fats recipes', 'soft overall consumer demand', 'Irish stock-market listed peers', 'strong end-market volume outperformance', 'lower-margin Irish dairy business', 'other GLP-1 weight-loss drugs', 'higher US share valuations', 'large scale re-formulation', 'free cash flow', '81pc cash conversion', 'retiring Tom Moran', 'annual general meeting', 'new nutritional needs', 'strong market outperformance', 'US food manufacturing', 'other currency swings', 'Dubliner Fiona Dawson', 'US political climate', 'possible US adoption', 'key share listing', 'continued volume growth', 'large dollar exposures', 'healthier taste alternatives', 'first full year', 'less currency volatility', 'Preliminary full-year results', 'other supplements', 'new chair', 'Irish Independent', 'GLP-1 use', 'strong performance', 'food products', 'share growth', 'primary listing', 'Irish company', 'nutritional renovation', 'Ms Dawson', 'US investors', 'US snacks', 'biggest market', 'declining market', 'growth opportunities', 'significant growth', 'financial hedging', 'Edmond Scanlon', '2.5pc decline', 'significant part', 'North America', 'sharp drop', 'Mr Scanlon', 'financial tools', 'underlying performance', 'reporting currency', 'recent years', 'global business', 'currency areas', 'geographic footprint', 'America Healthy', 'ingredients business', 'policy-driven shift', 'high-sugar, high-salt', 'bakery lines', 'mass use', 'small portion', 'early trading', 'biggest faller', 'weak start', 'margin expansion', 'foodservice innovation', 'broad range', 'sustainability aspects', 'constant currency', 'geopolitical uncertainty', '33-year veteran', 'executive director', 'final dividend', 'Davy Stockbroker', 'Cathal Kenny', 'weakening dollar', 'weaker dollar', 'potential impact', 'European markets', 'big impact', 'beverage markets', 'Sales volumes', 'last year', 'European company', 'sustainable nutrition', '2025 record revenue', 'Ebitda margin', 'Kerry Co-op', 'Adjusted earnings', 'Kerry Group', '150 markets', 'effect', 'operations', 'likes', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'Shares', 'Tuesday', 'margins', 'EPS', 'USA', 'parity', 'currencies', 'cases', 'job', 'concerns', 'tariffs', 'flat', 'UK', 'Ozempic', 'consumers', 'clients', 'beverages', 'Euronext', 'Americas', 'customers', 'positioning', 'leader', 'cost', '6pc', '10pc', 'macroeconomic', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '17.9pc', 'Mars', 'International', 'Marks', 'Spencer', 'Reckitt', 'Lego', 'April', '98 cent', '1.5']",2026-02-17,2026-02-18,independent.ie
