This announcement and certain other documents relating to the Transaction have been or will be prepared in accordance with Jersey law disclosure requirements  format and style  all of which differ from the disclosure and other requirements of United States securities laws. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly  the Transaction is subject to the disclosure requirements of and practices applicable in Jersey to schemes of arrangement  which differ from the disclosure requirements of the United States tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. Except in relation to Non-IFRS financial measures  any financial statements or other financial information included in this announcement and the Scheme Circular has been or will have been prepared in accordance with (i) with respect to CoinShares  accounting standards applicable in Jersey  which may not be comparable to financial information of U.S. companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and (ii) with respect to the Vine Hill Group  U.S. GAAP and the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”).

Performance was driven by balanced contributions from volume and non-volume related activities  supported by disciplined capital allocation. At the same time  we continued to invest for the future.In 2025  Euronext delivered the first meaningful milestones of its strategic plan. We scaled up our SaaS offering and increased our footprint in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol. We successfully built the first integrated ETF market in Europe. This industry-led initiative received strong support from issuers  representing more than 90% of the European ETF Assets under Management  as well as major European brokers. We delivered value-creative M&A through the acquisition of Athex Group entirely in shares  in line with Euronext’s disciplined investment criteria and our vision of building more integrated European capital markets.In 2026  we will intensify the execution of our strategic initiatives. In March 2026  we will diversify our commodities franchise with the addition of power futures. We will complete our Repo offering to create a truly European Repo market by June 2026. In September 2026  Euronext Securities will start to settle cash equities traded in Amsterdam  Brussels and Paris  an important step in becoming the CSD of choice in Europe.We enter 2026 with confidence and determination. Confidence because we know that we have the right value proposition and talents to further expand our integrated value chain across Europe  and determination because our vision of a united  competitive European capital market has become more relevant than ever. We welcome the ambitious proposals of the European Commission to accelerate the delivery of the Savings and Investments Union. The proposals align with our ambition to serve as the backbone of deep and integrated European markets and to contribute actively to such a development.”2025 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseFY 2025 FY 2024 % var % var(like-for-like  constant currencies) Underlying revenue and income 1 823.2 1 626.9 +12.1% +9.5% Reported revenue and income 1 818.8 1 626.9 +11.8% +9.5% Securities Services 330.7 309.5 +6.9% +4.6% Custody & Settlement 300.7 270.9 +11.0% +8.3% Other Post Trade 30.1 38.6 -22.0% -22.0% Capital Markets and Data Solutions (underlying) 669.3 597.1 +12.1% +6.9% Primary Markets 187.2 181.2 +3.3% +2.9% Advanced Data Solutions 263.5 245.0 +7.5% +7.4% Corporate and Investor Solutions and Technology Services (underlying) 218.7 170.8 +28.0% +10.4% FICC markets 342.8 295.0 +16.2% +16.7% Fixed income trading & clearing 196.6 160.8 +22.3% +22.3% Commodities trading & clearing 112.8 102.7 +9.9% +9.8% FX trading 33.4 31.5 +6.0% +10.3% Equity markets 410.0 367.0 +11.7% +10.6% Cash trading & clearing 359.3 308.4 +16.5% +15.3% Equity derivatives trading & clearing 50.7 58.5 -13.4% -14.1% Net treasury income 69.6 56.8 +22.6% +22.6% Other income 0.7 1.6 -54.5% -56.6% Underlying operational expenses excl.

This resulted from solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses  a dynamic trading environment across asset classes  and the positive contribution of acquisitions. Following the final PPA assessment of Admincontrol  contract liabilities have been adjusted to fair value at the initial recognition. This fair value adjustment was recognised as non-underlying item  reducing reported revenue by €4.4 million  with no impact on cash and cash equivalents.On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +9.5% in 2025  at €1 776.6 million  compared to 2024.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of underlying Group revenue in 2025  stable compared to 2024. This stable split reflects the strong growth in non-volume related revenue and income  underpinned by a dynamic trading environment. Non-volume-related revenue covered 157% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A  compared to 156% in 2024.2025 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation were at €680.1 million  up +9.6%. On a constant perimeter  underlying expenses were in line with the revised guidance of €660 million  and lower than the initial guidance of €670 million. In addition  Euronext recorded €20 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A from acquisitions performed over 2025.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +5.3% compared to 2024  which highlights the growth investments performed over 2025.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the year totalled €1 143.1 million  up +13.6% compared to 2024. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.7%  up +0.8 points compared to 2024. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2025 was up +12.1%  to €1 127.4 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.5%  up +1.5 points compared to 2024.2025 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation accounted for €199.9 million in 2025  up +5.9%  resulting from acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €86.9 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.2025 adjusted operating profit was €1 054.0 million  up +14.2% compared to 2024 adjusted operating profit. €125.4 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2025  related to acquisitions  integration costs and the PPA of acquired businesses.Net financing expense for 2025 amounted to €18.3 million  compared to a net financing income of €17.5 million in 2024. This decrease resulted from lower net interest income due to decreasing interest rates and new bond issuances with higher financing costs  as well as the non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds issued in May 2025.Results from equity investments amounted to €35.4 million in 2025  including €24.5 million of dividend received from Euroclear and €10.5 million of dividend from Sicovam. In 2024  Euronext reported €34.7 million of results from equity investments.Income tax for 2025 was €251.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.7% for 2025.Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to MTS and Nord Pool amounted to €47.2 million in 2025.As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +9.8% for 2025 compared to 2024  to €642.9 million. This represents a reported EPS of €6.34 basic and €6.29 diluted in 2025 (considering the convertible bonds under IAS 33)  compared to €5.65 basic and €5.63 diluted in 2024. This increase reflects the strong results and a lower number of shares over 2025 compared to 2024 due to the share repurchase programmes performed.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +7.9%to €736.5 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +10.3%in 2025  at €7.27 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €6.59 per share in 2024.The weighted number of shares used over 2025 was 101 352 825 for the basic calculation and 103 070 023 for the diluted calculation  compared to 103 578 980 and 103 983 870 respectively over 2024.In 2025  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €812.1 million  compared to €708.6 million in 2024.

This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59.7%  -1.0 pts vs. Q4 2024 mostly due to recruitments for the delivery of strategic growth projects and the impact of acquisitions.

Euronext reported a net financing expense of €4.3 million in Q4 2025  compared to €6.5 million net financing income in Q4 2024.

This represents a reported EPS of €1.42 basic and €1.41 diluted. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was up +4.2% to €179.6 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was €1.77 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €1.75.

Performance was driven by balanced contributions from volume and non-volume related activities  supported by disciplined capital allocation. At the same time  we continued to invest for the future.In 2025  Euronext delivered the first meaningful milestones of its strategic plan. We scaled up our SaaS offering and increased our footprint in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol. We successfully built the first integrated ETF market in Europe. This industry-led initiative received strong support from issuers  representing more than 90% of the European ETF Assets under Management  as well as major European brokers. We delivered value-creative M&A through the acquisition of Athex Group entirely in shares  in line with Euronext’s disciplined investment criteria and our vision of building more integrated European capital markets.In 2026  we will intensify the execution of our strategic initiatives. In March 2026  we will diversify our commodities franchise with the addition of power futures. We will complete our Repo offering to create a truly European Repo market by June 2026. In September 2026  Euronext Securities will start to settle cash equities traded in Amsterdam  Brussels and Paris  an important step in becoming the CSD of choice in Europe.We enter 2026 with confidence and determination. Confidence because we know that we have the right value proposition and talents to further expand our integrated value chain across Europe  and determination because our vision of a united  competitive European capital market has become more relevant than ever. We welcome the ambitious proposals of the European Commission to accelerate the delivery of the Savings and Investments Union.

This resulted from solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses  a dynamic trading environment across asset classes  and the positive contribution of acquisitions. Following the final PPA assessment of Admincontrol  contract liabilities have been adjusted to fair value at the initial recognition. This fair value adjustment was recognised as non-underlying item  reducing reported revenue by €4.4 million  with no impact on cash and cash equivalents.On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +9.5% in 2025  at €1 776.6 million  compared to 2024.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of underlying Group revenue in 2025  stable compared to 2024. This stable split reflects the strong growth in non-volume related revenue and income  underpinned by a dynamic trading environment. Non-volume-related revenue covered 157% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&A  compared to 156% in 2024.2025 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation were at €680.1 million  up +9.6%. On a constant perimeter  underlying expenses were in line with the revised guidance of €660 million  and lower than the initial guidance of €670 million. In addition  Euronext recorded €20 million of underlying expenses excluding D&A from acquisitions performed over 2025.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +5.3% compared to 2024  which highlights the growth investments performed over 2025.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the year totalled €1 143.1 million  up +13.6% compared to 2024. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.7%  up +0.8 points compared to 2024. On a like-for-like basis  adjusted EBITDA for 2025 was up +12.1%  to €1 127.4 million  and adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.5%  up +1.5 points compared to 2024.2025 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation accounted for €199.9 million in 2025  up +5.9%  resulting from acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €86.9 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.2025 adjusted operating profit was €1 054.0 million  up +14.2% compared to 2024 adjusted operating profit. €125.4 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in 2025  related to acquisitions  integration costs and the PPA of acquired businesses.Net financing expense for 2025 amounted to €18.3 million  compared to a net financing income of €17.5 million in 2024. This decrease resulted from lower net interest income due to decreasing interest rates and new bond issuances with higher financing costs  as well as the non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds issued in May 2025.Results from equity investments amounted to €35.4 million in 2025  including €24.5 million of dividend received from Euroclear and €10.5 million of dividend from Sicovam. In 2024  Euronext reported €34.7 million of results from equity investments.Income tax for 2025 was €251.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.7% for 2025.Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to MTS and Nord Pool amounted to €47.2 million in 2025.As a result  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +9.8% for 2025 compared to 2024  to €642.9 million. This represents a reported EPS of €6.34 basic and €6.29 diluted in 2025 (considering the convertible bonds under IAS 33)  compared to €5.65 basic and €5.63 diluted in 2024. This increase reflects the strong results and a lower number of shares over 2025 compared to 2024 due to the share repurchase programmes performed.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up +7.9%to €736.5 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +10.3%in 2025  at €7.27 per share  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €6.59 per share in 2024.The weighted number of shares used over 2025 was 101 352 825 for the basic calculation and 103 070 023 for the diluted calculation  compared to 103 578 980 and 103 983 870 respectively over 2024.In 2025  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €812.1 million  compared to €708.6 million in 2024. The difference results from higher profit before tax  higher income tax  and lower negative impact from changes in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 75.2% of EBITDA in 2025.Q4 2025 business highlightsIn €m Q4 2025 Q4 2024 % var % var l-f-l Underlying revenue and income 460.8 415.8 +10.8% +6.4% Securities Services 83.9 77.6 +8.1% +6.2% Capital Markets and Data Solutions (underlying) 178.2 153.9 +15.8% +7.0% FICC Markets 82.6 75.7 +9.0% +10.1% Equity Markets 101.6 90.1 +12.8% +8.1% Net Treasury Income 14.4 17.9 -19.4% -19.4% Other income 0.1 0.5 -73.1% -80.7%Non-volume-related revenue Securities ServicesIn €m Q4 2025 Q4 2024 % var % var l-f-l Revenue 83.9 77.6 +8.1% +6.2% Custody & Settlement 76.7 70.0 +9.6% +7.6% Other Post Trade 7.2 7.7 -6.3% -6.4%Revenue from Custody and Settlement in Q4 2025 was at €76.7 million  +9.6% compared to Q4 2024. This strong performance reflects Euronext’s continued growth in assets under custody  resilient settlement activity and double-digit growth of value-added services  as well as the contribution from Athex CSD from 24 November 2025. Assets under custody in Euronext Securities reached €7.6 trillion at the end of the quarter  up +7.7% compared to the end of Q4 2024. Close to 37 million instructions were settled via Euronext Securities during the fourth quarter of 2025  up +9.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.Other Post Trade revenue  which includes membership fees and other non-volume-related clearing fees  was €7.2 million in Q4 2025.

Euronext sustained its leading position for equity listings with 16 new listings.Advanced Data Solutions revenue was €67.0 million in Q4 2025  up +8.1% compared to Q4 2024. This strong performance reflects growing client demand for diversified datasets (including for FICC and post-trade data) and increased interest from retail clients  as well as a catch-up in audit and compliance fees.Corporate and Investor Solutions and Technology Services underlying revenue grew by +35.2% in Q4 2025 to €63.0 million. This strong performance demonstrates the benefits from the integration of Admincontrol  continued expansion of Euronext’s colocation services and the contribution of Athex Group.Net Treasury IncomeNet Treasury Income was at €14.4 million  -19.4% compared to Q4 2024.

The increase compared to Q4 2024 reflects investments in growth and the impact of acquisitions performed in 2025.As a result of the double digit growth in revenue  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached €275.0 million  up +8.9% compared to Q4 2025. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59.7%  -1.0 pts vs. Q4 2024 mostly due to recruitments for the delivery of strategic growth projects and the impact of acquisitions. On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  adjusted EBITDA grew by +5.5% compared to Q4 2024.Following the final PPA assessment of Admincontrol  contract liabilities have been adjusted to fair value at the initial recognition. This fair value adjustment was recognised as non-underlying item  reducing reported revenue by €4.4 million (compared to €0.0 million in Q4 2024)  with no impact on cash and cash equivalents. Q4 2025 non-underlying operating expenses excluding D&A amounted to €9.8 million  mostly related to the Athex Group transaction and the integration of recent acquisitions. As a consequence  reported EBITDA was at €260.8 million  up +8.1% compared to Q4 2024.Q4 2025 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation accounted for €54.2 million in Q4 2025  +9.3% more than Q4 2024. The increase mainly relates to acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €27.7 million. The ramp up reflects the integration of the PPA for Admincontrol from this quarter. Adjusted operating profit was €253.2 million  up +9.5% compared to Q4 2024. Euronext reported a net financing expense of €4.3 million in Q4 2025  compared to €6.5 million net financing income in Q4 2024. The variation reflects decreasing interest rates and the recognition of non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds  partly offset by the benefit of the tender offer and early redemption of a portion of the EUR 2026 bonds. Euronext received €10.9 million of results from equity investments in Q4 2025  mostly reflecting the dividend received from Sicovam.Income tax for Q4 2025 was €56.8 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.7% for the quarter  compared to 26.6% in Q4 2024. Share of non-controlling interests amounted to €11.7 million  mostly correlated with the resilient performance of MTS and Nord Pool.As a result  the reported net income (share of the parent company shareholders) was stable compared to Q4 2024  at €144.7 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.42 basic and €1.41 diluted. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was up +4.2% to €179.6 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was €1.77 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was €1.75. The weighted number of shares used over the fourth quarter of 2025 was 101 352 825 for the basic calculation and 103 070 023 (including convertible bonds) for the diluted calculation  compared to 103 578 980 and 103 983 870 respectively over the fourth quarter of 2024. The difference in share count is due to the issuance of shares for the acquisition of Athex Group  the share repurchase programmes executed by Euronext and the consideration of the convertible bonds under IAS 33.In Q4 2025  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €85.5 million  compared to €175.0 million in Q4 2024  mainly reflecting the negative impact of working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities in Q4 2025. Excluding the impact of working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 60.3% of EBITDA in Q4 2025.Q4 2025 corporate highlights since publication of the third quarter 2025 results on 6 November 2025Euronext successfully secured refinancing until 2028On 18 November 2025  Euronext completed a successful €600 million13  3-year senior unsecured fixed-rate bond issuance  offering a 2.625% annual coupon and rated “A-” by S&P.

As a principal issuing member  Banqup will leverage Visa’s global network to deliver virtual commercial cards that allow SMEs to optimise cash flow by extending payment terms while ensuring suppliers get paid immediately.By embedding Visa’s innovative payment capabilities directly into the Banqup platform  the solution allows customers to comply seamlessly with new e-invoicing and tax regulations while benefiting from Visa's world-class payment capabilities  such as the ability to pay invoices with cards  while driving digitisation  reducing costs  and improving business insight. Visa will also support Banqup's go-to-market strategy through strategic guidance and joint marketing initiatives to ensure successful adoption.“In a market driven by regulation and speed  this partnership allows us to leapfrog the competition ” said Arthur Paijens  CEO of Banqup SA  the payment company within Banqup Group SA. “Working with Visa’s scale and global network enables us to offer the most technologically advanced and cost-effective money movement tools available. This empowers our customers to manage the complexities of e-reporting and cross-border P2P transactions with complete confidence.”This collaboration addresses a profound market need: transforming complex European e-invoicing regulations and administrative tasks into simple  automated workflows. The central goal is to free small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) from administrative burdens  allowing them to focus entirely on growing their business.

The site will serve as MPM Group’s logistics and technical hub  with the objective of storing its equipment there and managing its preparation operations.An AutOnom® immediately re-letThis AutOnom® building developed by ARGAN has been re-let with no vacancy period  confirming the strong interest from users in this type of solution. Gas has been completely eliminated and replaced by electric heat pumps  while the building produces and consumes its own green energy through a photovoltaic power plant coupled with battery storage systems. In addition  a Building Management System enables the operator to monitor and control energy consumption. All of these features led to a ‘BREEAM Very Good’ certification of the building.The site also benefits from an extension potential of approximately 8 000 sq.m  for which all administrative permits have already been secured  allowing delivery within 12 months following approval. This expansion capacity will enable MPM Group to support its future growth or  if necessary  accommodate a second user on the site.ARGAN has a PREMIUM portfolio representing close to 4 million sq.mRonan Le Lan  Chairman of ARGAN’s Executive Board: “With this new signing  our portfolio  comprising around one hundred logistics sites representing 4.0 million sq.m  maintains an occupancy rate close to 100%. This performance reflects ARGAN’s teams’ expertise in asset and property management. The AutOnom® warehouse in Augny also illustrates ARGAN’s ability to develop clustered operations: the site benefits from an extension potential of approximately 8 000 sq.m  and ARGAN also controls a project enabling the development of a new warehouse of around 7 000 sq.m within the Frescaty area  in the immediate proximity of the 185 000 sq.m AMAZON warehouse delivered a few years earlier.”Thomas Iannucci  Managing Director and Partner  MPM Group: “The technical and environmental qualities of this AutOnom®-labelled site fully meet our high ambitions in terms of environmental performance. This modern new facility will enable us to consolidate several existing sites  optimize our logistics organization  and significantly improve working conditions for our employees. It will also serve as a true showcase for MPM Group’s expertise and commitments. We are particularly pleased to be moving into this strategic site  designed to sustainably support our growth.”This transaction was carried out with the support of the teams from Dumur Immobilier and JLL  who advised both parties in the deal.2026 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 26: General Assembly 2026April 1: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2026quarter 2026 July 23: Half-year results 2026October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20262027 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 4: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2026quarter 2026 January 21: Annual results 2026March 25: General Assembly 2027About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.

The launch underlines JCDecaux’s ambition to establish 360 Footprint as an international benchmark and help raise standards for responsible communication.360 Footprint: a pioneering holistic impact measurement toolAgainst a backdrop of calls for greater transparency from brands  public authorities and citizens  almost 60% of European marketing professionals said in 20251 they were already tracking the carbon footprint of their digital marketing campaigns.Aware of this evolution  JCDecaux decided as early as 2021 to go further by offering advertisers and agencies a unique and comprehensive calculator covering four areas:Carbon footprint  expressed in CO₂ emissions.Water footprint  expressed in cubic metres.Social footprint  measured as the number of local full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs supported.Economic footprint  measured by the value created in the national economy.360 Footprint makes it possible to measure both the environmental impact of campaigns and their societal benefits  while also identifying concrete levers for improvement.From success in France to international rolloutAfter four years of deployment in France  the initial results confirm the relevance and operational value of 360 Footprint for advertisers. Between 2021 and the end of 2025  360 Footprint analysed more than 235 campaigns across a wide range of sectors – including luxury  energy  travel and transport and FMCG – for nearly 50 major advertisers such as LVMH  L’Oréal  SNCF Connect  Michelin  the Bel Group and Kering.As accelerating and globalising environmental and socio-economic challenges are transforming many markets  JCDecaux is now rolling out 360 Footprint internationally: in Brazil  Italy and Germany  with further markets to follow from 2026.An enhanced version to cover all JCDecaux environmentsJCDecaux has launched an enhanced 360 Footprint tool now covering all its advertising environments. This new version helps clients reduce their impact  underlining the role of JCDecaux as a sustainable media  providing concrete solutions such as low-impact inks  certified or recycled paper  optimised formats and adjusted print density.A key lever of JCDecaux’s 2030 ESG StrategyJCDecaux has long been a committed partner to cities  regions and brands  improving quality of life through sustainable services such as advertising-funded street furniture. The rollout of 360 Footprint supports the 2030 ESG and Climate Strategies of JCDecaux  targeting major emissions cuts in line with its Net Zero ambition  and builds on strong extra-financial ratings.A communication campaign to support the launchTo support the international rollout of the new 360 Footprint  JCDecaux chose Publicis Consultants  which built a communication plan around the idea that 360 Footprint “measures what you can’t see” in a JCDecaux campaign: its carbon and water footprint  plus related jobs and economic value. This concept will be brought to life on a transparent street furniture and will be amplified on JCDecaux’s social media through short educational videos to engage the market and industry stakeholders.Lénaïc Pineau  Chief Sustainability and Quality Officer at JCDecaux  said: “360 Footprint will help us further strengthen our pioneering role in responsible communication. As the only solution that offers a 360° view of campaign impact  360 Footprint goes beyond measurement: it enables us to open an informed conversation with our clients  our partners and local authorities  so that together we can transform how we design communication and manage its impact.”Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “360 Footprint embodies JCDecaux’s vision: as a sustainable media  we are making outdoor advertising a driver of transparency and progress for our clients. This international rollout marks a new milestone in our commitment to combining innovation with positive impact  while laying the foundations for an international standard that benefits brands  citizens and local communities.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2024 revenue: €3 935.3m – H1 2025 revenue: €1 868.3mN°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 091 811 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 894 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants12 026 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the SBF 120 and CAC Mid 60 indexesJCDecaux’s Group carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the SBTi and the company has joined the Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° indexJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (11.9)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (629 737 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 157 airports and 257 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 848 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (83 472 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (736 310 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (178 010 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (89 526 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (22 490 advertising panels)N°2 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (20 689 advertising panels)For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on X   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Clémentine Prat+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – clementine.prat@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.com1 FreeWheel – European Marketers Survey  2025Attachment,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.02,positive,0.7,0.3,0.0,True,English,"['holistic tool', 'full impact', 'JCDecaux', 'campaigns', 'local full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs', 'Euronext Paris CAC® SBT 1.5° index', 'Lénaïc Pineau', 'pioneering holistic impact measurement tool', 'Group carbon reduction trajectory', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'CAC Mid 60 indexes', 'L’Oréal', 'European marketing professionals', 'advertising-funded street furniture', 'strong extra-financial ratings', 'transparent street furniture', 'short educational videos', 'Jean-François Decaux', 'major emissions cuts', 'Net Zero ambition', 'Home Media company', 'successful pilot launch', 'digital marketing campaigns', 'holistic tool', 'related jobs', 'Bel Group', 'pioneering role', 'local authorities', 'local communities', 'advertising environments', '1,091,811 advertising panels', '360 Footprint tool', 'sustainable media', 'social media', 'full impact', 'environmental impact', 'campaign impact', 'positive impact', 'enhanced version', 'environmental, economic', 'international benchmark', 'public authorities', 'comprehensive calculator', 'four areas', 'CO₂ emissions', 'cubic metres', 'national economy', 'societal benefits', 'concrete levers', 'four years', 'initial results', 'wide range', 'SNCF Connect', 'globalising environmental', 'socio-economic challenges', 'new version', 'concrete solutions', 'low-impact inks', 'print density', 'key lever', 'committed partner', 'sustainable services', 'Climate Strategies', 'Publicis Consultants', 'industry stakeholders', 'Chief Sustainability', 'informed conversation', 'Executive Board', 'new milestone', 'international standard', 'Key Figures', 'daily audience', '850 million people', '50 major advertisers', 'responsible communication', 'communication campaign', 'communication plan', 'international rollout', 'carbon footprint', 'operational value', 'economic value', 'greater transparency', 'many markets', '2030 ESG Strategy', 'Quality Officer', 'H1 2025 revenue', 'social footprint', 'Water footprint', 'Economic footprint', 'new 360 Footprint', 'JCDecaux SE', 'JCDecaux environments', 'JCDecaux campaign', '2024 revenue', '235 campaigns', 'France', 'number', 'standards', 'backdrop', 'calls', 'brands', 'citizens', 'evolution', 'agencies', 'unique', 'improvement', 'deployment', 'relevance', 'end', 'sectors', 'luxury', 'energy', 'travel', 'transport', 'FMCG', 'LVMH', 'Michelin', 'Kering', 'accelerating', 'Brazil', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'clients', 'paper', 'formats', 'cities', 'regions', 'life', 'line', 'idea', 'concept', '360° view', 'partners', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'vision', 'driver', 'progress', 'commitment', 'innovation', 'foundations', '80 countries', '10,000 inhabitants', '12,026 employees', 'Eurolist', 'SBF 120', 'SBTi']",2026-02-18,2026-02-19,globenewswire.com
