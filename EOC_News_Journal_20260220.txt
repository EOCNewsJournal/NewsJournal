These technologies enable vehicles to communicate with infrastructure and other road users  helping to reduce road accidents and congestion  promote cleaner and more efficient transport  and pave the way for Europe’s future automated mobility systems. C-Roads Italy is part of the EU funded C Roads initiative  which coordinates C-ITS deployments across more than 20 Member States.Almaviva will distribute Eviden’s national-scale Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems Public Key Infrastructure (C-ITS PKI) across Italy to strengthen its transport & mobility activities  and MOOVA—its integrated  modular and seamless mobility platform designed to connect multiple modes of transport within a unified digital ecosystem.Eviden contributes a certified and trusted cybersecurity product already deployed across Europe  along with deep expertise in transport security ecosystems. At the heart of the agreement lies secure communications for intelligent and cooperative transport systems  establishing robust digital trust domains and guaranteeing message authentication  integrity and confidentiality.Indeed  C-ITS encompass vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications  known as V2X  enabling use cases that involve public and private stakeholders. As these entities deploy C-ITS communication stations in vehicles and along road infrastructure  a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is essential to ensure the security  confidentiality  trustworthiness and native interoperability of their interactions.Eviden’s C-ITS PKI  available as a SaaS offering within MOOVA  will include hosting services  technical support and ongoing maintenance allowing Italian public and private sector clients to benefit from end-to-end local support and operations  backed by more than a decade of collaboration between Eviden and Almaviva.Yann Vincent  head of cybersecurity products  Eviden  Atos Group  said “We look forward to supporting C-ITS projects in Italy alongside Almaviva  the country’s leading information and communications technology group  and to bringing our C-ITS PKI solution—built on decades of expertise in high-assurance cryptographic infrastructures and digital identity—to support Italy’s ambitious plans for the rollout of secure  mobile  and connected road transport.”Dario Ferrillo  transport infrastructure & logistics director  Almaviva  said: “The collaboration with Eviden represents a fundamental step in Almaviva's journey to accelerate the evolution of smart and cooperative mobility in Italy.

The gradual resumption of listings for the William Peel brand at the end of the quarter failed to offset the downward trend in full.2025 revenues were down 17.6% at €69.1 million.The International Strategic Brands business in the Off-Trade sector declined  particularly William Peel  which suffered from delisting by certain distributors and the associated loss of market share throughout the year. However  agreements were reached at the end of the year to allow commercial relations to resume on a more balanced basis. The Marie Brizard brand recorded a slight improvement in the fourth quarter thanks to continued innovation.The On-Trade market performed well (+35.2%) throughout 2025.International: revenues fell slightly by 1.7% to €25.4 million in Q4 2025  as many distributors significantly reduced their stocks and the economic environment remained unstable (decline in consumption  increase in tariffs  etc.).2025 revenues were down 1.4% at €102.9 million.The decline in direct export activity was only partially offset by the increase in Industrial Services activity.Sales slowed in Western and Eastern Europe  particularly in Lithuania  Bulgaria and Denmark. However  Industrial Services activity in Spain recorded strong sales growth in Q4 2025. The Asia-Pacific region continued to decline.In the United States  the increase in sales in the fourth quarter  driven by the Sobieski and Marie Brizard brands  reflects a spread over a longer period of destocking by distributors.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (the “Company”) (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2025.Cumulative 2025 revenues€m 31 December 2024 LFL change Currency impact and scope effects 31 December 2025 LFL change Reported growth France 83.9 -14.8 - 69.1 -17.6% -17.6% International 104.5 -1.4 -0.2 102.9 -1.4% -1.5% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 188.4 -16.2 -0.2 172.0 -8.6% -8.7%Q4 2025 revenues€m Q42024 LFL change Currency impact and scope effects Q42025 LFL change Reported growth France 22.0 -2.8 - 19.2 -12.9% -12.9% International 25.6 -0.4 0.2 25.4 -1.7% -0.9% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 47.6 -3.3 0.2 44.6 -6.9% -6.4%France ClusterAgainst the backdrop of a slowdown in the French spirits market  revenues for the France Cluster amounted to €69.1 million in 2025  down 17.6% compared with 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2025  revenues were down 12.9% compared with the fourth quarter of 2024  at €19.2 million.This continued decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to the William Peel brand  which suffered from delisting by certain distributors and the subsequent loss of market share. However  an agreement was reached with the relevant customers at the end of the quarter.In both distribution channels  all International Strategic Brands posted a decline in sales  with the exception of Marie Brizard  which benefited in the fourth quarter from the full effect of the innovations launched in 2024.During the 2025 financial year  there was a sharp decline in revenues from commercial activity with the Off-Trade sector  particularly for the William Peel brand. This was due to delisting linked to certain players refusing to accept the price increases implemented at the beginning of the year to cover high inflation in the cost of maturing spirits.The Marie Brizard brand performed well throughout the year  gaining market share thanks to strong commercial momentum and innovations in the range of flavours which is part of the dynamic of the cocktail category.In the On-Trade channel  sales in the France Cluster performed well quarter after quarter  with strong growth at the end of the year.International ClusterThe International Cluster recorded revenues of €102.9 million in 2025  a decline of 1.4% compared with 2024  with contrasting performance across regions and entities.Sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 followed the same trend  decreasing by 1.7% compared with the same period in 2024.Notably  Interbrands Denmark was acquired during the fourth quarter. Its sales represented just under 0.2% of the Group’s consolidated revenues for 2025 during the post-acquisition period.MBWS International (Export) recorded a 13.6% decline in revenues in the fourth quarter  continuing to a lesser extent the trend observed in the third quarter of 2025. The fourth quarter was marked by:- an increase in shipments to the UK and Polish markets;- a decline in sales in continental Europe and more significantly in Asia  particularly in South Korea (due to destocking by the local distributor) and Japan (due to large shipments at the end of 2024 accompanying the change of distributor).Overall  sales fell by 9.6% in 2025  with declines in all markets except the French overseas departments and regions  Belgium  Morocco and Poland.Spain performed well in Q4 2025  with sales up 42.5%  driven by a 102% increase in Industrial Services activity. This was on a low comparison base linked to major production line modernisation work carried out in Q4 2024  which halted production.Full-year revenues were up 17.6%  with growth across all main activities and brands.In Denmark  the fourth quarter accentuated the downward sales trend seen in Q3 2025  with a decline of 25.7%. The new distribution entity  acquired at the end of the year and complementing the Group’s brand portfolio and distribution capacity in the Danish market  has yet to have a significant impact.Overall performance for 2025 remains heavily negative (-21.8%)  due to the termination of Agency Brand contracts and intense competition within the categories of the brands distributed.Lithuania posted a 9.3% decline in sales in Q4 2025  impacted by a slowdown in export activity  particularly to Ukraine  the main market in the region.Full-year activity was down 1.4% overall  particularly in the domestic market(-8.1%  with a structural decline)  due to the significant impact of increased excise duties  particularly on vodka and Scotch whisky  and increased competition. Export sales increased by 9.3%  mainly driven by the Industrial Services business and the William Peel and Sobieski International Strategic Brands.Bulgaria posted Q4 2025 sales down 7.2%  reflecting growth in the domestic market (particularly International Strategic Brands  including Sobieski)  but a decline in wine sales.Exports fell more sharply (-22.3%) due to a loss of customers in Romania and the United States  coupled with virtual stagnation in the Industrial Services business.The decline over the full year 2025 was similar (-6.8%)  with consistent performances across businesses  markets and brands.In the United States  revenues increased by 32.9% in Q4 2025 thanks to a greater contribution from the Marie Brizard brand  as well as an economic recovery in Sobieski shipments linked to distributor destocking over a longer period. The vodka market remains highly competitive.However  sales declined significantly over the year (-19.4%)  particularly for the Sobieski brand  due to destocking by our importer. This was not offset by the strong growth of the Marie Brizard brand.In Brazil  sales in Q4 2025 were down 36.9% (at constant exchange rates). This was due to a national crisis unrelated to Marie Brizard – the detection of counterfeit spirits containing methanol  which led to a sharp slowdown in alcohol sales - as well as destocking by distributors at the end of the year due to a change in tax regulations in the state of São Paulo.Sales fell by 10.5% over the year  affecting all international  local and Agency Brands  against a backdrop of spending power and household debt  compounded by the methanol crisis and destocking linked to the change in tax regulations at the end of the year.OutlookThe 2025 financial year was marked by an unstable international environment with an overall negative impact on the economy  as well as persistent tensions in the global wine and spirits market. The Group’s performance in France was affected by tough trade negotiations with certain major Off-Trade customers  as well as the delisting of the William Peel brand from relevant banners for almost the entire year. Internationally  many distributors significantly reduced their stock levels  in some cases drastically  and trade negotiations were tense. Added to this were increases in import tariffs and excise duties  as well as reduced visibility  which led to operational difficulties. The improved performance of the Industrial Services business partially offset these impacts.In this context  conservative risk mitigation measures implemented mid-year to preserve the Group’s financial performance as much as possible helped to limit the effects of this overall decline in activity.To date  these trends appear to be continuing in 2026  and the Group intends to remain focused on its strategic priorities:The Group is consistently committed to operating under balanced commercial conditions with all stakeholders.As such  uncertainties surrounding the outcome of annual trade negotiations with the Off-Trade actors are a factor requiring vigilance.In addition  the Group continues to leverage all of its strategic assets to:- Create the conditions for profitable growth in its business portfolio and promote innovation initiatives  all within a context of sustainable transition - Strengthen its presence in key markets by leveraging its commercial networks and its portfolio of International Strategic Brands  Flagship Local Brands and Agency Brands - Strengthen its presence by leveraging its strong production capabilities  particularly through its Industrial Services offering  which is demonstrating improved performance and real growth potential - Ensure the overall resilience of its mainstream brands by combining targeted initiatives with agile commercial execution that adapts to consumer demand elasticity while maintaining rigorous cost management.Lastly  following the end-2025 acquisition of a distribution company in Denmark  the Group continues to identify relevant growth opportunities  both organic and external  within its two clusters. The Group is studying the implementation of these initiatives with a view to long-term development in the current market environment for wines and spirits.Financial calendar- 2025 annual results: 16 April 2026- Q1 2026 revenues: 30 April 2026Investor and shareholder relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexlerrelations.actionnaires@mbws.comTel.: +33 1 43 91 62 40 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr – lpoinsot@image7.frTel.: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group operating in Europe and the United States.

The Group boasts an unmatched platform that fueled increases in footfall and retailer sales of +1.8% and +3.4%(5)  respectively  in 2025.Across its portfolio  Klépierre remained highly responsive to evolving shopper preferences  curating a high-quality and well-balanced retailer mix that spans Fashion  Health and Beauty as well as Sports and Leisure category killers. Over 2025  these dynamics fueled a 4.6% rental uplift on renewals and relettings  while occupancy reached 97.1%  up 60 basis points year on year. Moreover  the low occupancy cost ratio of 12.5% enhanced the portfolio’s capacity to capture further rental upside.Supported by limited new supply and consumer spending  occupier demand for high-quality  profitable space has continued apace  underpinning sustainable rental growth. Top‑line performance remained robust  with net rental income advancing 5.1% year-on-year  to €1 120.4 million  led by a solid like‑for‑like growth of 4.5%(9) and full-year contributions from the 2024 acquisitions. Mall income continued to surge  up 12.1%  powered by Specialty Leasing and Retail Media  as Klépierre rolls out solutions in its shopping centers.Steadfast capital appreciation and 15% total accounting return2025 EBITDA(1) grew 5.5%  comfortably above the early-year initial guidance thanks to the strong net rental growth achieved  supported by controlled payroll and general and administrative expense. This operating growth coupled with a slight increase in financial expenses led to an expansion in net current cash flow per share of 4.6%  to €2.72.Meanwhile the NAV(2) per share rose by 9.5% year-on-year to €35.9 as of December 31  2025  driven by a 4.9% like-for-like portfolio value(10) appreciation  while the average EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY)(11) ended the period at 5.7%.Including the €1.85 cash dividend per share distributed in 2025  the Group generated a remarkable total accounting return(3) of 15% over one year and 31.4% over the period 2024-2025.Unassailable balance sheet2025 saw both S&P and Fitch rating agencies raise Klépierre’s investment grades to A-  and A(12)  respectively  further cementing the Group’s best-in-class credit rating within the European listed real estate sector.The Group secured more than €1 billion of long-term financing over the past 12 months  with an average 8.5-year maturity at a highly competitive blended yield of 3.3%. Klépierre also successfully refinanced its syndicated revolving credit facility by signing a new Green Pure Player line for €1 200 million.As of December 31  2025  consolidated net debt stood at €7.35 billion  largely unchanged from the prior year. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell further to 6.7x marking a new historic low  while the Loan-to-Value ratio declined to 34.7%. The interest coverage ratio remained healthy at 7.2x  and average debt maturity was 6.3 years at an average cost of debt of 1.9%.Latest accretive capital allocation operationsIn late 2025  Klépierre acquired Casamassima  the leading mall in the Bari (Italy) metropolitan area of 1.4 million inhabitants for a total consideration of €160 million. The mall records an annual footfall of 7.5 million and anchors some of the most iconic international retail brands  including Zara  Sephora  Foot Locker  Rituals  as well as the Apulia region’s only Primark. This transaction aligns with the company’s Business-to-Business roadmap  in accompanying the extension of category killer international retailers; several brands have committed to expanding their presence within Casamassima  including with new flagship stores. This investment is expected to generate a high-single digit cash return as early as year 1.On the extension front  Klépierre delivered on time and on budget  the extension of Odysseum in Montpellier (France)  to accommodate Primark and a brand-new dining area. The yield-on-cost of the total project is expected at 9%. The Group also initiated a new extension project at Le Gru  the leading mall in Turin (Italy) which welcomes more than 11 million visitors each year  with the aim of enlarging the footprint of the strongest omnichannel retailers. This €81 million investment is expected to deliver a yield-on-cost of 10%. The Group recently unveiled an extension project at the Romagna shopping center (Rimini  Italy)  a reference 73 000-sq.m. mall in Northern Italy. The 6 820-sq.m. extension project will accommodate  among others  the very first Primark store in the region and has a yield-on-cost that is expected to exceed 8%.In terms of disposals  the Group sold non-core assets representing a total of €205 million (13)  8% above appraisal values on average and a blended EPRA Net Initial Yield of 5.6%.Recognized leadership in sustainable developmentThrough its Act4Good® CSR strategy  Klépierre remains determined in developing the most sustainable platform for commerce. A key pillar of this strategy is the achievement of net-zero on scopes 1 and 2 by 2030  alongside concrete actions in support of employees  customers  retailers and partners who are critical to the Group’s success.Klépierre’s sustainability performance was high in 2025. The shopping center management teams succeeded in reducing the portfolio’s energy intensity further  reaching 74.6 kWh/sq.m. This helped reduce scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions intensity by 6% compared with 2024  bringing the reduction against baseline 2017 to 87%. Waste management performance also improved  with more than 53% of waste now recycled or reused  a four-point increase over the previous year. On the social front  83% of employees now have a CSR objective integrated into their performance plan.The Group strategy and strong performance have once again been recognized by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) in October 2025. Klépierre ranked first in the European Listed Real Estate category (all asset classes combined) and maintains its global leadership in the Retail category  retaining its score of 95/100 and its five-star rating.In December 2025  for the fifth year in a row  CDP included Klépierre in its “A” list out of 22 800 participants  while MSCI maintained its AA rating of the Group.DIVIDEND INCREASE AND 2026 OUTLOOKSubject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 7  2026  the Executive Board proposes the distribution of a cash dividend of €1.90(14) per share for 2025  a 3% year-on-year increase. The dividend is to be paid in two equal installments on March 10  2026  and July 7  2026.For full-year 2026  Klépierre expects to achieve a minimum of €1 130 million EBITDA(1) and at least €2.75 net current cash flow per share in a weaker indexation environment and under the following assumptions:A stable macroeconomic backdrop;Broadly flat retailer sales;No impact from further disposals or acquisitions; andCost of debt near-fully hedged in 2026.Klépierre begins the new year with confidence as its key organic rental uplift and mall income levers remain well positioned.In addition  the Group will benefit from the full-year contribution of the Casamassima (Bari) mall acquisition.GOVERNANCEAt its meeting on February 18  2026  the Supervisory Board acknowledged John Carrafiell’s decision to step down from his position as a member of the Supervisory Board and Chairman of the Audit Committee  effective at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 7  2026. Mr. Carrafiell has served as an independent member of Klépierre’s Supervisory Board since December 11  2014  and was approaching the 12-year tenure limit for independent directors as established by the Afep-Medef Code  prior to the expiration of his current term at the 2027 Annual General Meeting.To ensure a smooth transition  the Supervisory Board has resolved to recommend the appointment of Ludovic Jacquot as an independent member of the Supervisory Board at the upcoming Annual General Meeting on May 7  2026.

The Group intends to maintain an attractive remuneration policy for its shareholders  with progressive dividend growth and a new floor set at €0.85 in 2028  while maintaining a solid balance sheet.Sustainable value creation is the north star. Trust the future will drive profitable and sustainable growth  with an acceleration in cash flow generation compared to the Lead the future plan.

With Trust the future  we will accelerate growth in profitable B2C services and trusted solutions for enterprises — guided by strong ambitions in Customer intimacy  Innovative growth and Excellence at scale. Leveraging all levers in our hands  with disciplined investment  efficiency powered by AI and the commitment of our teams  the plan will generate superior cash flow and EPS growth.In France  in a market which remains competitive  we are shifting to a full fibre network with the implementation of our copper decommissioning industrial project while stepping up our efficiency efforts.The reconsolidation of MasOrange will create a step change and further strengthen our group profile.Our direction is clear: to be  and remain  the trusted partner for everyday digital life – serving individuals  organizations and communities – by providing always available connectivity and beyond that  innovative digital services.”Trust the future  three ambitions in actionIn a world where digital complexity and risks are rising  expectations for quality of service  security and simplicity are rising fast  while AI is reshaping every industry. In this context  trust is becoming a decisive choice criterion. Trust the future makes that advantage concrete — through reliable networks  embedded cybersecurity  responsible data and AI practices  and seamless user experiences.Trust is the foundation upon which the Group will build its future.This strategy will be deployed around three key strategic ambitions: customer intimacy  innovative growth and excellence at scale.1 – The first ambition is Customer intimacy  moving from best-in-class experience to deeper  more personal  more predictive relationships. The Group will better leverage its two strong assets: its 3404 million customer base and its powerful brand to grow its customer base  reduce churn and enhance loyalty. This will enable the Group:To continue to grow its customer base — particularly in Africa and Middle East (where demographics and the adoption of smartphones  data and fixed broadband continue to rise) and in underpenetrated segments in European countries (by accelerating convergence and FTTH). By 2028  Orange aims to add around 40 million additional fixed and mobile customers.— particularly in Africa and Middle East (where demographics and the adoption of smartphones  data and fixed broadband continue to rise) and in underpenetrated segments in European countries (by accelerating convergence and FTTH).

Orange aims to improve churn rates by up to 3 points in European countries. Augment relevant customer interactions with digital  through next-gen apps  AI digital assistants and marketplaces to foster smart cross-sell and enhance Customer Value Management.2 - The second ambition is to expand through Innovative growth.In all markets  Orange will scale fast growing services beyond connectivity. The Group will invest in profitable  fast-growing retail and business services to deliver €1bn in additional revenues by 2028 (vs 2025) on those services that split as follows.The Group will scale B2C services beyond connectivity where it has experience and already a positive track record: cybersecurity  home security  Orange travel  international money transfers in Europe (including France and Spain)  Mobile Money and Max it in Africa and Middle East. The Group aims to generate an additional €500m of revenue on a portfolio of double-digit growth services by 2028.where it has experience and already a positive track record: cybersecurity  home security  Orange travel  international money transfers in Europe (including France and Spain)  Mobile Money and Max it in Africa and Middle East. The Group aims to generate an additional €500m of revenue on a portfolio of double-digit growth services by 2028. Orange Business and Orange Cyberdefense will build on their leadership in cyberdefence  grow trusted cloud solutions and trusted AI services  and invest in specific verticals such as defense and health. The Group aims to generate an additional €500m of revenue on trusted B2B services by 2028; and Orange Cyberdefense has an objective to reach €2bn in revenue by 2030.Orange  contrary to some peers  has retained control of most of its infrastructure; the Group will continue to manage its unique infrastructure assets to create value and develop the wholesale monetization of these assets.3 - Third ambition is to deliver Excellence at scale leveraging Group scale for technological leadership and efficiency.Orange’s multi-local model is a unique strength — the reach of a global group and the agility of teams that are deeply rooted in their countries.Orange is leading with next-generation networks — fiber  4G  5G — and will keep modernizing by decommissioning 2G  3G and copper in Europe  while enhancing efficiency through AI and resilience with complementary solutions such as satellite.— fiber  4G  5G — and will keep modernizing by decommissioning 2G  3G and copper in Europe  while enhancing efficiency through AI and resilience with complementary solutions such as satellite. Orange will make its innovation capabilities and pooled expertise available across the Group  with shared platforms that accelerate time-to-market for digital services; It will step up mutualized operational efficiency   for instance in procurement with €1bn in expected savings.with shared platforms that accelerate time-to-market for digital services; It will step up mutualized   for instance in procurement with €1bn in expected savings. The Group will further expand AI deployment in every part of its daily operations  enhancing its use in four areas: customer experience  to develop highly-personalized interactions with a target of moving towards 100% of customer interactions augmented by AI; network management  covering multiple use-cases including  for example  the use of tools to decrease network downtime; internal processes  to improve operating efficiency; and in opening up new revenue opportunities  such as customer value management (CVM) and B2B LLM solutions. By 2028  Orange aims to achieve €600m in value5 generated from AI and an eCAPEX/sales ratio of around 14%.Trust the future will be translated into concrete financial outcomes in the Group divisionsIn France  in a mature market  Trust the future will aim to deliver stable retail services excl. PSTN over the next three years. The Group is implementing an ambitious efficiency plan to offset the decline of copper-related revenues amounting to €800 million euros. This will lead to “stable plus” EBITDAaL CAGR over 2025-2028. The combination of a “stable plus” EBITDAaL over the period  and a reduction in eCAPEX of over 300m€  will fuel a solid growth in “EBITDAaL – eCAPEX”. The Group expects Operating Cash Flow to grow by above +3% CAGR 2025-28.In Africa and Middle East  the Group anticipates an average high single-digit revenue growth over the next three years (CAGR 2025-28). This growth is expected to be reflected in EBITDAaL  which will also grow at a high single-digit rate. The combination of high-growth EBITDAaL and a stable eCAPEX/sales ratio will enable the Africa and Middle East division to achieve high single-digit growth in Operating cash flow (CAGR 2025-28).In Europe  Orange is expecting low single-digit growth in service revenues and low-to-mid-single digit EBITDAaL growth. Meanwhile  eCAPEX / sales is projected to decline to 14% thanks to strict CAPEX discipline. As a result  Operating Cash Flow is expected to reach a high single-digit CAGR 2025-28.At Orange Business  continued portfolio alignment to trusted solutions and efficiency gains are expected to improve continuously the EBITDAaL year-on-year trend toward stabilization  while Orange Cyberdefense—reported within the segment—intends to build on its momentum with a 2030 revenue objective of €2bn.For MasOrange  the Group anticipates low to mid-single-digit revenue growth  and low single-digit EBITDAaL growth  which  combined with the eCAPEX/-sales ratio at c. 12%  will lead to a mid to high single-digit CAGR 2025-28 growth of the Operating cash flow. With over €350m of synergies already achieved  the synergy target is confirmed to at least €500m. Full reconsolidation expected in H1 2026 will strengthen the Group’s profile and cash generation.Sustainable value creation is the north starThe Group’s strategic ambitions - Customer intimacy  Innovative growth and Excellence at scale - will fuel topline growth and drive EBITDAaL-eCapex growth. The Group is expecting a +2-point improvement in Operating cash flow margin between 2025 and 2028.The full reconsolidation of MasOrange  expected in H1 2026  will bring a significant step-up to cash generation. Organic cash flow is expected to grow double-digit and reach c.€5.2bn by 2028  while Free cash flow all-in growth will outpace Organic cash flow growth.The Group is introducing a new value-creation metric  the adjusted Earnings Per Share  which is expected to grow at c.10% CAGR 2025-28.Group Capital allocation policy will be driven by sustainable value creation.eCAPEX to sale ratio will decrease toward c.14% by 2028.Attractive shareholder return remains a priority. The dividend for 20266 will increase again to 0.79€ per share (payable in 2027)  with a new floor at 0.85€ for 2028  while the Group will preserve a solid balance sheet  with a progressive deleveraging towards its mid-term objective of c. 2x net debt/EBITDAaL by end 2028 (excluding any impact from a potential transaction in France).In terms of M&A  the priority will be in-market consolidation—especially the optionality in France—and selective bolt-on M&A  notably in cybersecurity and in Africa Middle East.Commitment to people  society and the planet is the bedrock of the Group’s strategy.Concerning people  Orange will continue to invest in skills  employability and leadership so that teams can adapt and lead in a fast-moving environment. Engagement remains strong  with 81% of employees being proud to work for Orange (Annual Engagement Survey  January 2026).For society  the Group will extend digital trust to all by targeting the availability of tiered-protection offers—B2C/B2B cybersecurity and dedicated solutions for young people—in 100% of countries by 2030  and by providing free training in digital uses to 6 million people by 2030 vs 2021  notably through its Orange Digital Centers.For the Planet  Orange reiterates its environmental trajectory: a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on all scopes by 2030 vs. 2020  and Net Zero Carbon by 2040  driven by energy efficiency  decarbonization  circular economy initiatives and country-specific adaptation plan to address more extreme weather events.About OrangeOrange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the 2025 financial year.Key figures for the 2025 financial year2024 2025 2025/2024 Consolidated revenues €641 M €803 M +25% Consolidated EBITDA €388 M €542 M +40% Proposed dividend €7.50per share €8.94per share +19%Highlights45 orders received during the financial year  including 37 orders for LNG carriers  of which 18 in the fourth quarterOrder book with 288 units for the core business and 48 units for the LNG as fuel business Record number of final investment decisions in new LNG trains (84 Mtpa) in 2025  expected to lead to a significant increase in the need for new LNG carriers Acceleration and change of scale in the field of marine and digital solutions with the acquisition of Danelec Refocusing of Elogen’s business model and implementation of measures planned as part of the strategic review2026 guidance:2026 consolidated revenues between €740 M and €780 M;2026 consolidated EBITDA between €490 M and €530 M;Dividend policy maintained.Commenting on the results  François Michel  Chief Executive Officer of GTT  said:“GTT is building on the global momentum for liquefied natural gas and posted a record financial performance in 2025 for the third consecutive year. After a period of uncertainty related to the international context that negatively impacted the first part of the year  the fundamentals of LNG demand led to a record volume of investment decisions for new liquefaction units  thus increasing visibility on our growth potential.The strong upturn in LNG carrier orders during the fourth quarter of 2025 and at the beginning of 2026 to meet the rise in LNG demand reaffirmed GTT’s central role in this value chain. We will continue to pay particular attention to the evolving needs of our customers and stakeholders in the energy and maritime transportation industry. The combination of this position and our expertise forms the basis of our innovation strategy  the achievements of which were again recognised by several classification societies throughout the year. The Group has also continued to invest in advanced technologies.Our maritime and digital division was strengthened through the acquisition of Danelec in late July. We are thus expanding our service platform  enabling ship-owners and charterers to benefit from our expertise and assistance to best optimise the operation of their fleet.In financial terms  GTT posted an increase in revenues of 25%. This performance is the result of the particularly significant level of orders received in 2022 and 2023 and the continued commitment of the GTT teams  to whom I would like to give special thanks. EBITDA showed a sharp increase of 40%  confirming the Group’s discipline in terms of cost control and its ability to ensure the profitability of its business”.Group business activity in 2025Containment systems and services to operations- LNG carriers and ethane carriers: solid performance in a mixed environment in 2025Following three record years in terms of order intake  and in an uncertain geopolitical environment  GTT achieved a solid commercial performance in its core business over the financial year 2025  with 37 LNG carrier orders and seven very large ethane carrier (VLEC) orders. This momentum confirms the resilience of global demand for LNG transport  supported by massive investment decisions in new liquefaction projects. Delivery of these 37 LNG carriers is scheduled for between 2027 and 2031.Notably  among these 37 LNG carrier orders  six are for ultra-large vessels (271 000 m³ compared with the standard 174 000 m³)  placed with the Chinese shipyard Hudong-Zhonghua. These vessels will be fitted with GTT’s NO96 Super+ membrane containment system.The seven VLECs ordered will each offer a total capacity of 100 000 m³  the largest to date for this type of vessel  and will feature GTT’s Mark III membrane containment system. Delivery of these ethane carriers will take place in 2027 and 2028  confirming the growing strength of the ethane market  driven by the expansion of global petrochemicals.Over the period  GTT also received an order for the design of the tanks for one Floating Liquefied Natural Gas unit (FLNG) with a total capacity of 238 700 m³. Ordered by Samsung Heavy Industries  this vessel will be deployed in Africa.In addition  since the beginning of 2026  GTT has announced 14 orders for LNG carriers  four of which have a capacity of 200 000 m3  as well as two orders for VLECs  confirming the momentum seen at the end of the previous year.- LNG as fuel: improving performance in a buoyant marketIn 2025  GTT recorded a total of 18 orders for the design of cryogenic tanks for new LNG-powered container vessels  up from the 13 orders received in 2024. Among the orders reported in 2025  12 tanks with a unit capacity of 12 750 m3 were ordered by the Korean shipyard HD Hyundai Heavy Industries and six cryogenic tanks with a unit capacity of 8 000 m3 were ordered by HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering.These LNG tanks will all be fitted with GTT’s Mark III Flex membrane containment system  together with the “1 barg”1 design  which enables an operating pressure of 1 barg  compared to 0.7 barg previously. This technical innovation addresses forthcoming regulations requiring cold ironing at quayside  confirming its added value for the maritime industry. The vessels will be delivered between the second quarter of 2027 and the fourth quarter of 2028.In the third quarter of 2025  GTT also received an order from Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. for the design of tanks for an LNG bunker vessel with a total capacity of 18 600 m³  scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2028.- Services for vessels equipped with membrane containment systemsRevenues from the services business were maintained at 23 million euros in 2025 (compared to 23.3 million euros in 2024)  with the decline in pre-project studies  which are intermittent by nature  being offset by the growth in supplier approvals. These approvals related  in particular  to Chinese shipyard suppliers supporting LNG carrier construction and the structuring of the local supply chain.Marine and digital solutions: a change of scale and a strengthened value propositionThe acquisition of Danish company Danelec  a major player in the collection and analysis of maritime data  significantly enhances GTT’s digital offering. Completed on July 31  2025  this transaction enables GTT to respond more broadly to the needs of ship-owners by now offering products and services aimed at optimising vessel performance and strengthening fleet safety  as well as dedicated applications to players in the LNG value chain.The Group is now the global leader in vessel performance management and has joined the top tier of players in the critical Voyage Data Recorders (VDR) segment  now covering 15%2 of the global fleet. The integration of Danelec  started in August 2025  is progressing as planned. Its aim is to accelerate the growth of the Marine and Digital Solutions division through cross-selling  achieving an estimated 25 to 30 million euros in 2030.GTT’s digital solutions (hardware and software) recorded a solid commercial performance  as demonstrated by the signing of several contracts attesting to the added value of the proposed solutions. The TMS group thus selected Ascenz Marorka to equip its entire fleet of more than 130 vessels (oil tankers  bulk carriers  liquefied gas carriers and container ships) with its Smart Shipping solutions. The digital services offering for LNG market players has also been commercially successful: China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) chose Ascenz Marorka to equip eight LNG carriers with a complete suite of onboard systems. In addition  the contract signed with Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding  a long-standing GTT partner  to equip 24 LNG carriers with its Sloshield™ system  highlights the strength of GTT’s integrated offering  combining the digital solutions developed within its Digital division with its historical expertise in the design of cryogenic membrane containment systems.The revenues of GTT’s Marine and Digital Solutions division more than doubled in 2025  reaching 36.1 million euros  compared to 15.6 million euros in 2024. As of December 31  2025  this division now includes the activities of the subsidiaries Ascenz Marorka  VPS and Danelec  since August 2025. Danelec’s contribution over the five months of the financial year 2025 amounts to 16.1 million euros.Elogen: completion of the business refocusing planFollowing the conclusions of the strategic review of its subsidiary Elogen  the Group completed the planned restructuring measures announced at the beginning of the year. A redundancy plan was implemented  resulting in the elimination of 110 positions. The construction of the Vendôme gigafactory was also definitively halted. As such  GTT recorded non-current operating expenses of 45 million euros in the first half of 2025. Elogen’s business is now focused on stack research and development at the world’s highest technological level.As of December 31  2025  Elogen recorded revenues of 4.6 million euros  down -59.6% compared to December 31  2024. In line with the action plan resulting from the strategic review  Elogen’s EBITDA was brought to -16.1 million euros as of December 31  2025  compared to -33.3 million euros at the end of 2024.Continued innovation momentumGTT continued its strong momentum in innovation and investments in research and development. The Group thus filed a total of 68 patents in 2025  a level comparable to that of 2024 (66 filings at the Group level). GTT’s ongoing approach of cutting-edge innovation also resulted in several AiPs3 from classification societies granted in the Group’s various areas of expertise:LNG carriers and ethane carriers:Two AiPs from Bureau Veritas for its optimised containment systems for ethane transport  Mark III Slim TM and NO96 Slim TM . These approvals confirm major advantages: increased tank capacity  reduced costs and optimised construction time.and NO96 Slim . These approvals confirm major advantages: increased tank capacity  reduced costs and optimised construction time. At the Gastech exhibition and conference in Milan in September 2025  GTT also received a second AiP from Lloyd’s Register for its optimized containment systems for ethane transportation  as well as a General Approval4 for an improved version of the NO96 Super+ technology.LNG-powered vessels:One approval from DNV for the design of membrane tanks rated for 1 barg  intended for LNG-powered vessels. This concept provides several benefits to ship-owners: extended retention time  higher bunkering temperature and compliance with the requirements for cold ironing at quayside.An AiP from Bureau Veritas for its new GTT Cubiq™ tank technology  dedicated to container ships.Alternative fuels:GTT received an AiP from Lloyd’s Register for the “NH₃-ready5” rating of the Mark III containment system applicable to LNG-powered vessels  as well as LNG carriers (LNGCs)  very large ethane carriers (VLECs) and bunkering vessels. This innovation strengthens the flexibility of vessels by enabling them to adopt  transport or use ammonia (NH₃)  a lower-carbon energy alternative.The Group also concluded several joint development projects with long-standing partners to strengthen the performance and competitiveness of its technologies and participate in the introduction of disruptive technologies  confirming its status as a benchmark in the LNG industry. In this respect  GTT announced a strategic partnership with BLOOM ENERGY and PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP to develop an integrated energy system combining Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) powered by LNG with Marine Carbon Capture designed to cover the vessel’s energy needs related to onboard consumption.GTT Strategic VenturesIn 2025  the GTT Strategic Ventures fund made two additional investments  bringing the number of stakes it holds to nine.In April 2025  GTT Strategic Ventures invested in novoMOF  a company specialising in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)  compact and high-performance materials for CO₂ capture  particularly well-suited to maritime transportation. In July 2025  it invested in CorPower Ocean  whose wave energy technology harnesses the power of the sea with resilience and efficiency  offering stable and competitive electricity generation among renewable marine energiesGTT Strategic Ventures also increased its stake in bound4blue in a 38 million euro fundraising round. The increase in its stake demonstrates the Group’s long-term confidence and its ability to support the companies in its portfolio in their industrial development.Non-financial performanceThe implementation of the actions resulting from GTT’s CSR roadmap for 2024-2026 led to an improvement in its non-financial performance in 2025  and to the renewal of its “B” rating in the CDP climate questionnaire for the fourth year running. The renewal of the Group’s ISO 9001 certification reaffirms its ambition to offer its customers the best services and to guarantee operational excellence.The results of the CSR roadmap for 2025 will be presented in the Universal Registration Document to be published at the end of April 2026.GovernanceThe GTT Board of Directors acknowledged the resignation of Ms Virginie Banet on 13 February 2026 and thank her for her contribution to the Board's work. The recruitment process for her successor is underway.Order book as of December 31  2025As of January 1  2025  GTT’s order book  excluding LNG as fuel  comprised 332 units. The following developments have occurred since January 1:Deliveries completed: 82 LNG carriers  2 ethane carriers and 5 onshore storage tanks;Orders received: 37 LNG carriers  7 ethane carriers and 1 FLNGAs of December 31  2025  the order book  excluding LNG as fuel  stood at 288 units  broken down as follows:261 LNG carriers;21 ethane carriers;3 FSRUs (Floating Storage and Regasification Units);3 FLNGs (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas vessels).Regarding LNG as fuel  with the delivery of 21 vessels and orders for 18 container ships and one LNG bunker vessel  the order book stood at 48 vessels as of December 31  2025.Consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 2024 2025 Change Total revenues 641.4 803.0 +25% Containment systems 591.1 739.3 +25% of which LNG carriers/ethane carriers 552.5 697.8 +26% of which FSRUs6 1.4 11.5 +721% of which FLNGs7 4.6 10.2 +122% Onshore storage tanks 1.7 0.0 - of which LNG-powered vessels 30.9 19.7 -36% Services to operations 23.3 23.0 -1% Marine and digital solutions 15.6 36.1 +131% Electrolysers 11.4 4.6 -60%Consolidated revenues for the financial year 2025 stood at 803.0 million euros  up 25% compared to 2024  benefiting from the increase in the number of vessels under construction and the growth of the marine and digital business.Revenues from new builds amounted to 739.3 million euros  up 25% compared to revenues in 2024  reflecting the increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction. Royalties from LNG and ethane carriers amounted to 697.8 million euros (+26%)  11.5 million euros for FSRUs and 10.2 million euros for FLNGs. Royalties generated by the LNG as fuel business (19.7 million euros) saw a decrease of 36% compared to 2024  impacted by increased competition in this booming market.Revenues from services to operations were stable at 23 million euros in the financial year 2025  due to the reduced number of pre-project studies completed during the year  offset by the growth in supplier approvals.Revenues from marine and digital solutions were 36.1 million euros  up +131% in the financial year 2025  thanks to the commercial successes of the subsidiaries Ascenz Marorka and VPS  as well as the acquisition of the Danish company Danelec on July 31  2025. Danelec’s contribution over the five months of the financial year 2025 amounts to 16.1 million euros.Revenues from Elogen’s electrolyser business line amounted to 4.6 million euros in financial year 2025  versus 11.4 million euros in 2024.Analysis of the 2025 consolidated income statement(in millions of euros; earnings per share in euros) 2024 2025 Change Revenue 641.4 803.0 +25.2% Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) 388.1 541.8 +39.6% EBITDA margin (on revenues  %) 60.5% 67.5% Operating income (EBIT) 374.3 521.3 +39.3% EBIT margin (on revenues  %) 58.4% 64.9% Net income 347.8 413.6 +18.9% Net margin (on revenues  %) 54.2% 51.5% Net earnings per share8 (in euros) 9.4 11.2 +18.7%In 2025  Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to 541.8 million euros  up 39.6% compared with 2024. The EBITDA margin stood at 67.5%  compared to 60.5% a year earlier  driven by business growth and effective cost control. External expenses were down slightly (-0.5%) compared to the previous financial year  in line with the decrease in costs related to tests and studies. Personnel expenses increased (+12.5%)  due to higher headcount at the subsidiaries  in particular due to the integration of Danelec from August 1  2025  and the adjustment in wages linked to inflation.Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) amounted to 521.3 million euros in the financial year 2025  i.e. a margin on revenues of 64.9%  compared to 58.4% in 2024.Net income for the 2025 financial year amounted to 413.6 million euros  up 19% over the previous year.Other 2025 consolidated financial data(in millions of euros) 2024 2025 Change Capital expenditures(including investment subsidies) 68.5 244.8 +258% Dividends paid 228.9 290.2 +27% Cash position 343.3 346.9 +1%The Group’s capital expenditure for 2025 increased substantially  mainly due to the acquisition of Danelec for 194 million euros. GTT also continued to invest in the renovation of its headquarters  in line with its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and took on new minority stakes through its GTT Strategic Ventures fund.In view of these investments  the increase in dividend payments and a controlled increase in working capital requirements (-26.4 million euros)  in a context of strong business growth  GTT had a positive net cash position of 346.9 million euros as of December 31  2025  an amount equivalent to that of December 31  2024.Dividend for financial year 2025On February 19  2026  the Board of Directors  after approving the financial statements  decided to propose the distribution of a dividend of 8.94 euros per share for the financial year 2025  up 19% compared to 2024. Payable in cash  this dividend will be subject to approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on June 16  2026. As an interim dividend of 4 euros per share was paid out on December 11  2025 (in accordance with the Board of Directors’ decision on July 29  2025)  the cash payment of the balance of the dividend  amounting to 4.94 euros per share  will take place on June 19  2026 (ex-dividend date: June 17  2026). This proposed dividend corresponds to a payout ratio of 80% of consolidated net income.In addition  the Company plans to pay out an interim dividend for 2026 in December 2026.OutlookAt the end of December 2025  the Group had very strong visibility on its revenues  thanks to the commercial successes of the last three years. The order book corresponds to very significant future cumulated revenues of 1 592 million euros (609 million euros in 2026  542 million euros in 2027  286 million euros in 2028  and 155 million euros in 2029 and beyond).The gradual end of the effect of the order peak seen in 2022 (162 units) and the temporary slowdown in orders seen in the first half of 2025 will have a limited impact on GTT’s growth for the financial year 2026. Consequently  2026 is expected to be the second-best financial performance in GTT’s history  allowing the Group to announce the following objectives:For the financial year 2026:2026 consolidated revenues between €740 M and €780 M;2026 consolidated EBITDA between €490 M and €530 M;Dividend policy maintained9.***Presentation of the 2025 full-year resultsFrançois Michel  Chief Executive Officer  and Thierry Hochoa  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT’s results for the financial year 2025  and answer questions from the financial community at a conference call to be held  in English  on Friday  February 20  2026  at 8.30 a.m.  Paris time.This conference will be broadcast live on GTT’s website.To join the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004United States +1 718 705 87 96Other countries: + 39 02 802 09 11Confirmation code: 140215The presentation document will be available on the website on February 20  2026 from 8:30 a.m.Financial calendar2026 first-quarter activity update: April 22  2026 (after close of trading)Shareholders’ Meeting: June 16  2026Publication of 2026 half-year results: July 28  2026 (after close of trading)2026 third-quarter activity update: October 23  2026 (after close of trading)About GTTGTT is a technology and engineering group with expertise in the design and development of cryogenic membrane containment systems for use in the transport and storage of liquefied gases.

We have met or exceeded all the financial targets that we set out at our Capital Markets Day (CMD) in 2023  and I would like to thank all my colleagues across our businesses for their dedication and hard work that made this possible.We generated EUR 1.3 billion of operating capital (OCG)  ahead of our EUR 1.2 billion target. We also reported EUR 829 million of free cash flow  consistent with our EUR ~800 million target for 2025. Our main business units remained well capitalized  and we delivered a full year IFRS operating result of EUR 1.7 billion  an increase of 15% compared with 2024.In the US  commercial momentum remained strong. Transamerica expanded its distribution network  World Financial Group (WFG)  to over 95 000 licensed agents  and  at the same time  achieved a record 30% increase in individual new life sales in 2025 compared with 2024. Assets under administration at Transamerica’s Retirement Plans business also increased. At the same time  the capital employed by Transamerica’s Financial Assets decreased to USD 2.7 billion  ahead of our USD 2.9 billion target for 2025. This gives us confidence that our plans have a robust foundation as we work to further accelerate growth in our US business. We also reported solid results in our other business units. Our asset management business delivered EUR 1.0 billion in net third-party inflows in 2025  while our International business continued to perform well  and  in the UK  our Workplace Platform generated GBP 2.4 billion in net inflows.During 2025  we returned EUR 1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.On the basis of our performance in 2025  we propose a final dividend of 21 eurocents per share. This will result in a total dividend paid for the full year 2025 of 40 eurocents  consistent with our target.We are now fully focused on delivering upon the plans we outlined at our 2025 CMD  including the relocation of our head office and legal seat to the US. I am confident that we can build upon the strong momentum we created during 2025 and continue to accelerate the growth of our businesses throughout the coming year.”Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7:00 am CET.SupplementsAegon’s second half 2025 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com .Webcast and conference call including Q&AThe webcast and conference call start at 9:00 am CET.

None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Cautionary note regarding non-IFRS measuresThis document includes the following non-IFRS measures: operating result and valuation equity. Operating result is calculated by consolidating  on a proportionate basis  Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies  except for its associate  ASR Nederland N.V. Operating result reflects Aegon’s profit before tax from underlying business operations and mainly excludes components that relate to accounting mismatches that are dependent on market volatility or relate to events that are considered outside of the normal course of business. Valuation equity represents the sum of shareholders’ equity and the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) after-tax (embedded value of unearned profits in insurance contracts). This measure is intended to provide a more comprehensive view of the Group’s economic value. Aegon believes that these non-IFRS measures  together with the IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business  including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the “Company"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31  2025.Key Highlights Q4-25Revenue of € 166.4 million increased 25.4% vs. Q3-25 and 8.5% vs. Q4-24 primarily due to higher shipments for 2.5D AI-related computing and photonics applicationsOrders of € 250.4 million up 43.3% vs. Q3-25 and 105.4% vs. Q4-24 due principally to a broad-based increase in demand by Asian subcontractors for 2.5D datacenter applications  renewed capacity purchases for photonics applications and a significant increase in hybrid bonding ordersGross margin of 63.9% increased 1.7 points vs. Q3-25 primarily due to a more favorable product mix. Q4-25 gross margin was relatively flat vs. Q4-24Net income of € 42.8 million increased 69.2% vs. Q3-25 due to higher revenue  increased gross margins and lower than anticipated operating expense growth. Similarly  Besi’s net margin of 25.7% increased 6.7 points vs. Q3-25. Vs. Q4-24  net income and net margin decreased 27.8% and 12.9 points due to the absence of an € 18.2 million net tax benefit recognized in Q4-24Strong liquidity position at year end with cash and deposits of € 543.0 million and net cash of € 36.0 million. Vs. Q3-25  cash and deposits and net cash increased by € 24.4 million and € 43.8 million  respectivelyKey Highlights FY 2025Revenue of € 591.3 million down 2.7% vs. 2024 principally due to broad-based weakness in mobile  automotive and industrial end-user markets partially offset by increased revenue from Asian subcontractors for AI-related datacenter and photonics applicationsOrders of € 685.0 million rose 16.8% due to strength in AI-related 2.5D demand for datacenter applications by Asian subcontractors and renewed capacity purchases for photonics applicationsGross margin of 63.3% decreased 1.9 points due primarily to a 12% decrease in the value of the US dollar versus the euro in the first half yearNet income of € 131.6 million declined 27.7% due primarily to lower gross margins  higher interest expense  net and an increased effective tax rateProposed dividend of € 1.58 per share.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi’s progress in 2025 reflected the favorable influence of increased AI spending on our business development. Orders of € 685.0 million increased by 16.8% versus 2024 due to strength in AI-related 2.5D demand for datacenter applications by Asian subcontractors and renewed capacity purchases for photonics applications. Growth accelerated in the second half of the year with orders increasing 63.6% versus the first half year. Orders for AI applications represented approximately 50% of our total orders in 2025 and revenue from Besi’s computing end-user market grew from approximately 40% of revenue in 2024 to 50% in 2025.For the year  revenue of € 591.3 million decreased by 2.7% versus 2024 due to lower shipments for mobile  automotive and industrial end-user markets as a result of ongoing weakness in overall assembly markets. We continued to maintain attractive levels of profitability with gross  operating and net margins realized of 63.3%  29.3% and 22.3%  respectively. Given profits earned in 2025 and our solid liquidity position  we will propose a cash dividend of € 1.58 per share for approval at Besi’s AGM on April 23  2026  which represents a payout ratio relative to net income of 95%.Besi’s revenue  gross margin and operating expense development in Q4-25 exceeded the favorable end of prior guidance. Revenue of € 166.4 million and orders of € 250.4 million increased by 25.4% and 43.3% versus Q3-25 due principally to a broad-based increase in demand by Asian subcontractors for 2.5D data center applications  renewed capacity purchases for photonics applications and a significant increase in hybrid bonding orders. Net income of € 42.8 million increased 69.2% vs. Q3-25 due to higher revenue  increased gross margins from a more favorable product mix and lower than anticipated operating expense growth.We are pleased with our operational progress in 2025 as we completed a comprehensive strategic plan review with enhanced revenue and profit targets and organized additional production capacity and infrastructure to help support that growth. We also experienced progress on our wafer level assembly agenda as hybrid bonding adoption expanded to 18 customers  cumulative orders grew to 150+ systems and new use cases were identified for co-packaged optics  ASICs and consumer applications. In addition  six integrated hybrid bonding production lines were installed at a leading logic customer incorporating 30 Besi hybrid bonders in collaboration with Applied Materials. The first 50 nm placement accuracy prototype system was also completed and available for customer qualification. Our position in the TCB market was further enhanced as Besi’s TC Next adoption expanded to five customers for logic  memory and photonics applications. In addition  our flip chip and multi module die attach systems gained significant share in the market for AI-related 2.5D assembly structures addressing the rapid growth in demand for datacenter and photonics capacity. Further  we successfully introduced a variety of next generation die bonding and packaging systems for each of our traditional computing  mobile and automotive markets as we prepare for the next market upturn.We enter 2026 with increased optimism based on strong order momentum experienced in the second half of 2025 which has continued to date in the first quarter of 2026. Our current optimism is based on anticipated growth in three promising Besi revenue streams: 3D wafer level assembly  AI-related 2.5D capacity and more traditional mainstream assembly applications.Customer roadmaps point to expanded hybrid bonding and TC Next adoption over the next two years in the areas of HBM4/4e  co-packaged optics  ASICs and new high performance computing and mobile introductions. In addition  recent announcements of substantial AI-related infrastructure investments are expected to increase demand for advanced packaging. Increased AI investment has also created capacity shortages for 2.5D packaging which has caused producers to secure increased production from many Asian subcontractors. Our optimism also relates to the significant increase in demand from Chinese subcontractors as the country builds out its AI infrastructure. Further  many new advanced packaging fabs are planned for the US  Europe  Southeast Asia and Japan which should increase demand for our advanced packaging product portfolio.We also see market conditions improving in overall assembly markets based on favorable semiconductor unit growth trends and a significant reduction of excess semiconductor inventory. Green shoots are appearing after an extended downturn of nearly four years in each of our principal end-user markets.For Q1-26  we anticipate that revenue will increase by 5%-15% versus Q4-25 with gross margins ranging between 63%-65% aided by improved revenue and a more favorable advanced packaging product mix. Operating expenses are anticipated to increase by 10%-15% as we maintain discipline in overhead growth while continuing to increase development spending to support long-term growth opportunities.”Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 0.1 million of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 136.76 per share or a total of € 16.1 million.

In Q4-25  insurance turnover was down by -1.1% compared to Q4-24  which had posted strong growth. Fees and commissions were up +2.3%. Revenues benefited from a retention rate close to record levels (92.9%) in a market that remains competitive. New business reached €129 million  driven by increased demand and benefiting from growth investments.Client activity had a positive impact of +2.6% against a backdrop of considerable political and economic uncertainty  with world trade suffering from the reintroduction of tariffs in the United States. Pricing remained negative at -1.6%  close to the historical average.Revenue from non-insurance activities was up +7.8% compared to 2024. Factoring revenues were down -2.7% due to the fall in interest rates and weak client activity in both Germany and Poland  which was particularly marked in Q4-25. Information services revenue rose by +16.2% (and +18.8% on a reported basis  including Cedar Rose). Turnover from debt collection activities rose by +24.4% from a still modest base  confirming their counter-cyclical nature.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) 2024 2025 Variation % ex.

Factoring revenues were down -0.7%.In Western Europe  turnover was down by -2.8% at constant and current FX (-2.9% at current FX and perimeter). The slowdown in client activity was partially offset by higher information sales (services up +18.6%) and new business. The Financial Institutions segment is still suffering from terminations carried out at the start of the year.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was down -3.5% at constant FX (-3.1% at current FX). Credit insurance was negatively impacted by a non-recurring effect recorded in 2024  as well as the transfer of a major contract to the Asia-Pacific region.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +3.7% at constant FX and +3.0% at current FX on the back of a high retention rate. Economic activity  which had been more dynamic than in the other regions until then  slowed down.In North America  turnover was down -0.2% at constant FX (-5.1% on a reported basis). The region is benefiting from an improvement in new business  but is suffering from a slowdown in client activity and the sharp fall in the dollar since the start of the year.In Latin America  turnover was up +11.7% at constant FX and +4.6% at current FX. The region is benefiting from the persistently high level of local inflation  which is benefiting client activity.In Asia-Pacific  turnover rose +8.5% at constant FX and +4.6% at current FX  driven by client activity and the transfer of a major contract from Central and Eastern Europe.2. ResultCombined ratioThe annual combined ratio net of reinsurance was 73.1% in 2025  up 7.6 ppts year on year.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 37.5%  a 4.1 ppts from level reached on the previous year. This increase reflects the normalisation of claims  offset by the release of reserves  which remain at a high level. The number of mid-sized claims remains below long-term trends but is increasing.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remains in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 47.0 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio was 40.3%  up 5.1 ppts compared to 2024.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is pursuing its strict management policy in relation to both costs and investments  in line with its Power the Core strategic plan. Over the full year 2025  costs rose by +6.3% at constant FX and perimeter  and by +5.1% at current FX.The cost ratio before reinsurance was 35.6%  up 1.9 ppt year on year. This rise was mainly due to embedded cost inflation (1.3 ppt) and ongoing investments (1.6 ppt). In contrast  the improved product mix (information services  debt collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect.Financial incomeNet financial income was €65.8m in 2025. The total includes a negative FX effect of -€21.0m on financial assets  owing to the sharp fall in the dollar against the euro  as well as a negative impact of the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Turkey of -€11.2m.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) was €102.3m. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 3.1% for 2025. The yield on new investments was 3.7%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €9.2m (€42.5m in 2024). They include a significant FX gain (+€23.6m) on technical liabilities  which reflects the expense recorded on assets.Operating income and net incomeOperating profit totalled €332.5m over the year  down 18.7%  mainly as a result of the increase in the combined ratio.The effective tax rate was 24% for the year (25% in Q4-25) vs. 29% in 2024.In overall terms  net income (group share) was €222.0m  down -15.0% compared to 2024.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 December 2025  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 213.0m  up €19.4m or +0.9% (€2 193.6m at 31 December 2024).These changes are mainly due to the positive net income of €222.0m and the dividend payment of -€209.1m. Other items include changes in unrealised capital gains for €32.4m.The return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 11.4% at 31 December 2025  down 2.5 ppts mainly due to the change in financial income.The solvency ratio reached 197%5  an increase of 1 ppt compared to 2024. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%).Coface will propose €1.25 dividend per share at the Shareholders’ meeting  corresponding to a payout ratio of 84%6  in line with its capital management policy.4. OutlookAfter months of negotiations  the United States introduced an historically high number of trade barriers  bringing the effective rate of tariffs to an average of nearly 15%. Their recessionary effect was coupled with an increasingly hardline migration policy  which helped to maintain a certain balance in the labour market while creating political tensions domestically.Economic growth in the United States seems to be increasingly dependent on the single segment of investments related to the development of artificial intelligence: storage centres  computers and associated energy production. While the Fed seems satisfied with current interest rate levels  the forthcoming appointment of a new Chair has resulted in uncertainty over future interest rate policy and its consequences for the economic trajectory.The global economy continued to benefit from the fall in oil prices due to the rise in OPEC production. However  the rapid intervention by the USA in Venezuela and the renewed pressure on Iran marked the start of a new  more uncertain phase in international relations.While real growth remains weak and energy prices are falling  global trade in value terms remains sluggish  weighing on the growth prospects for the trade credit insurance market.Against this backdrop  Coface's disciplined underwriting policy has enabled it to again report very good results.2025 was marked by two acquisitions (Cedar Rose and Novertur) but thanks to its strong balance sheet and significant levels of cash flow  Coface is paying a very attractive shareholders’ return with dividend of €1.25 per share at the General Meeting. This is bringing the cumulative dividend over 5 years to almost €7 per share.The current turbulence on the markets has created an uncertain environment that supports demand for credit risk management solutions in the areas of insurance  information and debt collection.
