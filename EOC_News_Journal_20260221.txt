The decision requires unanimity among the 27 EU member states.The loan was agreed in December by EU leaders as a lifeline for Kyiv  which has a budget gap looming in April. At the time Hungary  Slovakia and the Czech Republic agreed to helping Ukraine only on condition that they would not be liable for interest costs or repayment of the loan  which would be backed by the other 24 EU countries. But a unanimous decision is still needed to allow the European Commission to use the so-called headroom of the EU budget to borrow and lend to Ukraine.An IMF programme worth €8 billion currently under negotiations is also conditional on Kyiv receiving the EU loan and could be endangered by the Hungarian veto. Tuesday marks the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Hungary’s move to block the loan comes as the country gears up for elections in April that could topple prime minister Viktor Orban  a long-time Brussels antagonist and ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Polls suggest the opposition Tisza Party led by Péter Magyar is leading Orbán’s Fidesz by about 10 points.Ahead of the vote  Orban has intensified his anti-Ukraine rhetoric. This week  he blamed Kyiv for halting flows via the Druzhba pipeline  which delivers oil from Russia to Hungary via Ukraine. The pipeline was damaged by Russia but Orban accused Ukraine of failing to make repairs.The anti-Ukraine rhetoric has been amplified across Hungary’s state media  which has replicated Russian arguments that EU funds to Ukraine are prolonging the war at the expense of Hungarian taxpayers.Without the loan  Ukraine risks running into financial collapse in the second quarter.The Hungarian permanent representation in Brussels did not respond to a request for comment.The loan was presented as a last-minute option after EU countries failed to agree to the use of immobilised Russian assets to fund Ukraine at a summit in December.Belgium  which hosts the majority of the assets at the European clearing house Euroclear  staunchly opposed the loan and was ultimately backed by Italy and France. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,True,English,"['€90 billion EU loan', 'war anniversary', 'Hungary', 'Ukraine', 'The Financial Times Limited', 'Russian president Vladimir Putin', 'The Hungarian permanent representation', 'prime minister Viktor Orban', '€90 billion European Union loan', 'opposition Tisza Party', 'Péter Magyar', 'European clearing house', '27 EU member states', 'other 24 EU countries', 'European Commission', 'financial collapse', 'Russian arguments', 'Hungarian ambassador', 'Hungarian veto', 'Hungarian taxpayers', 'Russian assets', 'EU budget', 'EU leaders', 'EU funds', 'fourth anniversary', 'full-scale invasion', 'four people', 'budget gap', 'Czech Republic', 'interest costs', 'IMF programme', 'Orbán', 'anti-Ukraine rhetoric', 'state media', 'second quarter', 'last-minute option', 'EU loan', 'war-torn country', 'unanimous decision', 'Brussels antagonist', 'Druzhba pipeline', 'Hungary', 'finances', 'Friday', 'objection', 'bloc', 'sum', 'debt', 'matter', 'unanimity', 'December', 'lifeline', 'Kyiv', 'April', 'Slovakia', 'condition', 'repayment', 'headroom', 'negotiations', 'Tuesday', 'move', 'elections', 'long', 'ally', 'Polls', 'Fidesz', '10 points', 'vote', 'flows', 'oil', 'repairs', 'expense', 'request', 'comment', 'Belgium', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'Italy', 'France', 'Copyright']",2026-02-20,2026-02-21,irishtimes.com

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA)  and Medincell (Euronext: MEDCL)  announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for olanzapine extended-release injectable suspension (TEV-'749) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. TEV-'749 is designed to improve real-world treatment adherence and help patients maintain long-term stability  with the goal of addressing a critical treatment gap for people living with schizophrenia.Currently  there is no long-acting olanzapine formulation without an FDA-required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  which mandates administration in a certified healthcare facility and requires a 3-hour post-injection monitoring period. In the Phase 3 SOLARIS trial  TEV-'749 administered as a once-monthly subcutaneous injection demonstrated an efficacy and safety profile consistent with currently available olanzapine formulations and showed no evidence for the need for post-injection monitoring.“Treatment adherence remains a major challenge and unmet need for people living with schizophrenia  including many who rely on oral forms of olanzapine. TEV-'749  our investigational subcutaneously delivered olanzapine LAI  has the potential to help provide stability by offering the proven efficacy and safety of olanzapine as a once-monthly treatment ” said Eric Hughes  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva. “For too long  the lack of a viable long-acting olanzapine formulation has limited the options available to these individuals  and we look forward to working with the FDA on the review of this NDA for TEV-'749 to help address this gap in care.”“Daily olanzapine is one of the most widely prescribed antipsychotics for people living with schizophrenia  and this long‑acting formulation may better fit into their lives ” said Christophe Douat  CEO of Medincell. “As experience with long‑acting injectables continues to grow  they are increasingly recognized as an important treatment option in serious psychiatric conditions. The potential reach of a practical long‑acting option is significant.”The NDA for TEV-'749 is based on results from the Phase 3 SOLARIS trial  including Week 56 results studying its efficacy  safety and tolerability in participants aged 18 to 64 living with schizophrenia.1 The results demonstrated an efficacy and safety profile consistent with currently available olanzapine formulations.1TEV-'749 is an investigational once-monthly subcutaneous LAI of the second-generation atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. It is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use at this time.TEV-'749 utilizes SteadyTeq™  a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell that provides a controlled steady  sustained release of olanzapine.About Subcutaneous OLAnzapine Extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS)SOLARIS is a multinational  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  parallel-group  placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of olanzapine extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use as a treatment in patients (ages 18-64 years) with schizophrenia.1 For period one of the study (first 8 weeks)  675 patients were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of once-monthly olanzapine LAI (TEV-'749) (low  medium or high dose) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.1 For period two (next 48 weeks)  patients who completed period one were randomized and equally allocated to one of the three olanzapine LAI (TEV-'749) treatment groups.1 The end-of-treatment and follow-up visits were 4 and 8 weeks after administration of the last treatment dose  respectively.1 The primary objective of the Phase 3 SOLARIS study was to evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine LAI (TEV-'749) in adult patients with schizophrenia.1 A key secondary objective was to further evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine LAI (TEV-'749) based on additional parameters in adult patients with schizophrenia.1 A secondary objective of period two of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of olanzapine LAI (TEV-'749) in adult patients with schizophrenia.1About SchizophreniaSchizophrenia is a chronic  progressive and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and acts.2 Patients experience an array of symptoms  which may include delusions  hallucinations  disorganized speech or behavior and impaired cognitive ability.2 3 4 Approximately 1% of the world’s population will develop schizophrenia in their lifetime  and 3.5 million people in the U.S. are currently diagnosed with the condition.3 4 Although schizophrenia can occur at any age  the average age of onset tends to be in the late teens to the early 20s for men  and the late 20s to early 30s for women.4 The long-term course of schizophrenia is marked by episodes of partial or full remission broken by relapses that often occur in the context of psychiatric emergency and require hospitalization.4 Approximately 80% of patients experience multiple relapses over the first five years of treatment  and each relapse carries a biological risk of loss of function  treatment refractoriness  and changes in brain morphology.5 6 7 Patients are often unaware of their illness and its consequences  contributing to treatment nonadherence  high discontinuation rates  and ultimately  significant direct and indirect healthcare costs from subsequent relapses and hospitalizations.2 3 4 5 6 7About TevaTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
