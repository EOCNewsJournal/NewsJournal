These data further expand the evidence base supporting development of obefazimod for inflammatory bowel disease  highlighting its anti-fibrotic potential in Crohn’s disease (CD)  a favorable safety and tolerability profile  rapid onset of symptomatic relief  and additional evidence supporting its mechanism of action in restoring immune balance through upregulation of miR-124.Marc de Garidel  MBA  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  commented: ""The robust data presented at ECCO this week reinforce obefazimod's unique and differentiated profile. The anti-fibrotic findings  taken together with the additional clinical efficacy  safety  and biomarker data presented  strengthen our confidence in obefazimod’s potential across UC and CD. As we look toward the upcoming Phase 3 maintenance trial readout in Q2 2026 and the Phase 2b ENHANCE-CD trial readout in Q4 2026  we remain focused on translating this data into real-world benefits for patients with IBD.""Fabio Cataldi  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Abivax  added: “The emerging preclinical evidence of anti-fibrotic activity is particularly compelling  as fibrosis remains an area of profound unmet need. Combined with the favorable safety and tolerability profile of obefazimod  we believe this growing evidence base positions obefazimod as a compelling oral therapy with the potential to address multiple dimensions of disease not yet fully managed by current therapies.”HIGHLIGHTED PRESENTATIONS:The 22 abstracts presented at ECCO 2026  including subgroup analyses from the Phase 3 ABTECT induction trials illustrating obefazimod’s clinical activity across a wide range of patient subpopulations  can be accessed at: https://www.abivax.com/publications/congress-publicationsObefazimod shows first evidence of anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease (Danese S et al. OP30  ECCO 2026) In an in vitro human fibroblast model  obefazimod led to a ~50% reduction in a biomarker of active fibrosis (Pro-C3) (p < 0.0001) and a ~30% reduction in a fibroblast activation marker (⍺SMA) (p < 0.0001) In an in vivo animal model  obefazimod exhibited dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects leading to rapid improvement in markers of disease activity Obefazimod demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects when initiated as a fibrosis preventative (day 5) or fibrosis treatment (day 20): ~25% (p<0.0001) and ~50% (p<0.0001) reduction in Disease Activity Index  with late (day 20) and early (day 5) treatment  respectively ~35% (p<0.0001) and ~65% (p<0.0001) reduction in histologic ulceration and inflammation scores  with late and early treatment  respectively Obefazimod demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects when initiated as a fibrosis preventative (day 5) or fibrosis treatment (day 20): ~45% (p<0.0001) and ~55% (p<0.0001) reduction in Collagen Deposition (fibrosis marker)  with late and early treatment  respectively ~40% (p<0.0001) and ~50% (p<0.0001) reduction in ⍺SMA (fibroblast activation marker)  with late and early treatment  respectively(Danese S et al. OP30  ECCO 2026)~60% (p<0.0001) and ~90% (p<0.0001) reduction in histologic Fibrosis Score  with late and early treatment  respectivelyIntegrated summary of safety of obefazimod in Phase 3 ABTECT induction trials (Seidler U et al. P0712  ECCO 2026) Of the 1 272 patients randomized and treated with Obe-50mg  Obe-25mg  or placebo (PBO)  the overall rates of serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was comparable across all groups (Obe-50mg: 3.1%; Obe-25mg: 2.2%; PBO: 3.2%) TEAEs leading to study discontinuation occurred at similar rates across all groups (Obe-50mg  4.7%; Obe-25mg  1.9%; PBO  4.1%) Headaches were one of the most frequent TEAEs and were reported to be mild  transient  and short in duration (median: 2-3 days) and rarely leading to discontinuation (0-1.1%)(Seidler U et al. P0712  ECCO 2026) Early symptomatic improvements with obefazimod in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Armuzzi A et al. P0923  ECCO 2026) A greater proportion of patients receiving obefazimod (50mg or 25mg) versus PBO achieved symptomatic response from week 1 and symptomatic remission from week 2 increasing through week 8 In a pooled analysis of the Phase 3 ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 induction trials  both Obe-50mg and Obe-25mg produced reductions in rectal bleeding subscores and stool frequency subscores versus PBO starting from week 1 and reaching a nominally significant difference by week 2 ( p-value <0.05 ) Improvement in symptoms consistently increased through week 8(Armuzzi A et al. P0923  ECCO 2026)Obefazimod enhances miR-124 expression in blood and colon tissue and reduces the key inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-6 in serum of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Siegmund B et al. P0868  ECCO 2026) In both Phase 3 ABTECT induction trials  Obe-25mg and Obe-50mg significantly enhanced expression of miR-124 in blood (unadjusted p < 0.0001 vs. PBO) and in rectal and sigmoidal tissue (unadjusted p < 0.0001 vs. PBO) at week 8 At week 8  Obe-25mg and Obe-50mg significantly reduced IL-17A levels in serum (unadjusted p < 0.0001 vs. PBO); Obe-25mg (p=0.0150 vs. PBO) and Obe-50mg (p=0.0039 vs. PBO) decreased IL-6 levels in serum miR-124 mechanism of action allows for partial reduction of inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 toward homeostatic levels without completely blocking these pathways(Siegmund B et al. P0868  ECCO 2026)Professor Silvio Danese  Director of the Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy Unit of the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital  added: “For patients living with inflammatory bowel disease  long-term disease control and preservation of bowel function are critical. Seeing data that address not only clinical response and safety  but also biological activity and fibrosis  is encouraging. If these findings continue to translate clinically  they may represent a meaningful advancement for patients who currently have limited options.”About AbivaxAbivax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics that harness the body’s natural regulatory mechanisms to stabilize the immune response in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.
