Last year  research by UCD showed just 10 investment funds held one-third of all nursing home beds in the market  a huge shift from 2017 when their presence was almost non-existent.Aedifica entered the Irish market in 2021 and has been highly active since  owning 22 properties with 2 300 users.During a call with investors  Stefaan Gielens  chief executive of Aedifica  listed Ireland as one of the markets he would be most keen to acquire more assets in when asked by an analyst.'There’s a clear demand for new capacity in Ireland  and it shows in the numbers ' says Gielens. Stock image/GettyGielens said Ireland was “doing much better than the rest of Europe”.“So  this is a fairly young portfolio with mature assets  but fairly young ” he said.“But what we do see in the portfolio in Ireland is that ramping up is going at quite remarkable speed  meaning that for most of these Irish care homes  12 months after delivery of the asset  we already see occupancy rates going above 80pc  in some cases  even reaching 90pc.”Gielens said levels of occupancy reported in Ireland’s facilities would not be seen in the rest of Europe for two years after delivery.“So there’s a clear demand for new capacity in Ireland  and it shows in the numbers ” he added.Aedifica’s results for 2025 showed the group had a total investment programme worth around €276m at the end of last year. Ireland’s budget was valued at €102m  the highest listed. Around €187m of the group’s total budget remained to be spent.Architect's plans for brand-new cancer centre to be built in Ballygrennan  LimerickThe group listed various projects for 2025  including developments in Ireland such as a Limerick cancer care centre and care homes in Kilcoole and Crumlin  Dublin. The Irish projects have a pipeline of investment worth €85.5m  the report said  with completions due next year and in early 2028.Aedifica’s portfolio of marketable investment properties in Ireland had grown in value by €7.2m during the year  up 1.7pc  the results said.Operator occupancy levels at Aedifica’s facilities had also hit 96pc in Ireland. This compares to an average of 91pc across the group’s portfolio.Aedifica has developed a portfolio of more than 615 properties across Belgium  Germany  the Netherlands  the UK  Finland  Ireland and Spain  valued at around €6.3bn.The real estate group is listed on Euronext Brussels with a market valuation of around €3.7bn. The Belgian group’s portfolio in Ireland is mainly focused on elderly care.Last July  the Sunday Independent reported about Aedifica’s plans to invest €26.5m in the development of a state-of-the-art cancer centre in Limerick. The centre will be operated by UPMC and Bon Secours Health System  Ireland’s largest private hospital group.Aedifica did not respond to a request for comment.,neutral,0.14,0.84,0.02,negative,0.0,0.33,0.67,True,English,"['care home market', 'leading Belgian investor', 'Ireland', 'ripe', 'acquisitions', 'Bon Secours Health System', 'Belgian care home investor', 'largest private hospital group', 'Limerick cancer care centre', 'nursing home beds', 'brand-new cancer centre', 'art cancer centre', 'Irish care homes', 'Aedifica CEO Stefaan Gielens', 'The Irish projects', 'real estate group', 'total investment programme', 'fragmented market ripe', 'Operator occupancy levels', 'marketable investment properties', 'private equity', 'elderly care', 'Belgian group', 'Irish market', 'various projects', 'total budget', 'international investment', '10 investment funds', 'ageing population', 'government funding', 'property trusts', 'huge shift', 'chief executive', 'clear demand', 'new capacity', 'Stock image', 'remarkable speed', 'occupancy rates', 'Euronext Brussels', 'market valuation', 'Sunday Independent', 'investment budget', 'healthcare properties', 'attractive markets', 'mature assets', 'two years', 'last year', 'International investors', 'young portfolio', '22 properties', '615 properties', 'Sector', 'rest', 'Europe', 'call', 'Architect', 'plans', 'Ballygrennan', 'country', 'consolidation', 'incomes', 'Ireland', 'acquisitions', 'company', 'past', 'increase', 'research', 'UCD', 'one-third', 'presence', '2,300 users', 'analyst', 'numbers', 'Getty', 'delivery', '80pc', 'cases', '90pc', 'facilities', 'results', 'developments', 'Kilcoole', 'Crumlin', 'Dublin', 'pipeline', 'report', 'completions', 'early', 'value', '96pc', 'average', '91pc', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'UK', 'Finland', 'Spain', 'UPMC', 'request', 'comment']",2026-02-22,2026-02-23,independent.ie
