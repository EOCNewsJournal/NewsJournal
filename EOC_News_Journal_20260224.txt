Our focus is on building sustainable long-term growth through transformative business development  leveraging our unique position and strengths as well as our collaboration with Gilead. We are pleased with the momentum we have built to date and will continue to apply a selective approach in pursuing the right opportunities and the right transactions. Through disciplined capital allocation  we aim to build a pipeline of novel therapeutics that can deliver meaningful benefits for patients and create long-term value for shareholders.

This strong financial position underpins our ability to act decisively and allocate capital in a disciplined manner as we evaluate business development opportunities. Following completion of the wind-down of the cell therapy activities  we continue to expect to be cash flow neutral to positive by the end of 2026 excluding any business development activities and currency fluctuations  and anticipate a 2026 year-end cash position in the range of €2.775 billion to €2.850 billion.”Post-period eventsThe Board of Directors appointed Paulo Fontoura as Non-Executive Independent Director by way of cooptation  replacing Dr. Susanne Schaffert  who stepped down effective November 1  2025.On January 5  2026  Galapagos announced that the works council consultation process regarding the wind-down of cell therapy activities had been completed and that its Board of Directors decided to initiate the wind-down of the Company’s cell therapy activities. The wind-down remains on schedule and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2026.The remaining Galapagos organization expects to be a lean organization of approximately 35-40 employees by the end of 2026  repositioned for long-term growth through transformational business development  while maintaining a dedicated presence at its headquarters in Mechelen  Belgium and its U.S. hubs in Chicago  IL and San Francisco  CA.With the wind-down progressing on schedule  Galapagos is now fully focused on pursuing transformative business development opportunities aligned with areas of high unmet medical need.Fourth Quarter 2025 Business UpdateCORPORATEContinued to strengthen and enhance the management team to drive implementation of Galapagos strategy by appointing Fred Blakeslee as Executive Vice President and General Counsel  effective October 16  2025  succeeding Ms. Valeria Cnossen. Additionally  Ms. Missotten  Chief Human Resource officer  ceased to be a member of the Executive Committee as of December 31  2025.

In connection with these co-optations  Non-Executive Independent Directors Dr. Elisabeth Svanberg  and Non-Executive Non-Independent Director and current CFO of Gilead  Andrew Dickinson  stepped down.IMMUNOLOGY SMALL MOLECULE PIPELINEIn December 2025  we announced topline Phase 2 results for TYK2 inhibitor  GLPG3667  in patients with dermatomyositis (DM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  which are summarized as follows: The GALARISSO DM study met its primary endpoint  showing that GLPG3667  administered once daily at 150 mg (N=21) in addition to standard-of-care therapy  achieved a statistically significant clinical benefit in the Total Improvement Score (TIS) 1 at Week 24 (p=0.0848; Δ: 14.26)  compared to placebo (N=19). The pre-specified threshold of statistical significance was set at 10% (α=0.1). GLPG3667 also showed meaningful clinical improvements compared to placebo on several secondary endpoints of disease activity  including TIS20  TIS40  TIS60 and m-CDASI-A 2 . GLPG3667 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile throughout the 24-week treatment period. In the GALACELA SLE study  GLPG3667  administered once daily at 75 mg (N=59) and 150 mg (N= 64) in addition to standard-of-care therapy  the primary endpoint analysis of dose-response on SLE responder index (SRI)-4 at Week 32 did not meet statistical significance. However  GLPG3667 showed numerical improvements over placebo (N=63) on several secondary endpoints  particularly on skin-related outcomes. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies with GLPG3667. The GALACELA study is currently ongoing  and the final Week 48 data  expected in the second quarter of 2026  will be essential to assess the totality of the evidence and determine potential next steps for the SLE program.As part of our ongoing efforts to maximize the value of this program for both patients and Galapagos  we are evaluating all strategic options. These include potential partnership and business development opportunities to accelerate development of GLPG3667 in DM. Additionally  we continue to explore opportunities to expand into other severe autoimmune diseases with significant unmet medical need.ONCOLOGY CAR-T CELL THERAPY UPDATEAs noted above  the Company announced in January 2026 the start of the wind-down of its cell therapy activities to pursue new transformational business development transactions using its available cash resources. In connection with the wind-down  we notified study investigators of the early termination of the Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 (CD19 CAR-T candidate GLPG5101) and Phase 1/2 PAPILIO-1 (BCMA CAR-T candidate GLPG5301) studies. Patients from both studies will roll over into the long-term HESPERIA study (NCT06652633) to monitor long-term safety and efficacy. Residual spending associated with these long-term follow-up studies is expected to be minimal.Financial performanceFull year 2025 key figures (consolidated)(€ millions  except basic & diluted earnings per share)December 31  2025 December 31  2024 % Change Supply revenues 29.9 34.8 -14% Collaboration revenues 1 082.3 240.8 +349% Total net revenues 1 112.2 275.6 +304% Cost of sales (29.7) (34.8) -15% R&D expenses (459.4) (335.5) +37% G&Ai and S&Mii expenses (153.4) (134.4) +14% Impairment of the cell therapy activities (228.1) - +100% Other operating income 53.5 40.8 +31% Operating profit/loss (-) 295.1 (188.3) Fair value adjustments and net exchange differences (39.4) 95.8 Net other financial result 45.2 89.4 -49% Income taxes 18.6 1.8 Net profit /loss (-) from continuing operations 319.5 (1.3) Net profit from discontinued operations  net of tax 1.4 75.4 Net profit of the year 320.9 74.1 Basic and diluted earnings per share (€) 4.87 1.12Cash and Financial investments 2 998.0 3 317.8DETAILS OF THE FULL YEAR 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTSTotal operating profit from continuing operations amounted to €295.1 million in 2025  compared to an operating loss of €188.3 million in 2024. This operating profit was primarily due to the release in revenue of the remaining deferred income balance allocated to the drug discovery platform for an amount of €1 069.0 million. The operating expenses were negatively impacted for a total of €399.8 million  by 1) the decision to wind down the cell therapy activities with an impact of €275.0 million  consisting of an impairment of the cell therapy activities of €228.1 million (on goodwill and fixed assets)  severance costs of €33.3 million  costs for early termination of collaborations of €16.3 million  deal costs of €10.1 million  €1.5 million additional accelerated non-cash cost recognition for subscription right plans and €7.5 million other costs  partly offset by a positive fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration payable of €21.8 million; and by 2) the strategic reorganization related to the small molecules business announced in January 2025  for €124.8 million. The latter was reflected in severance costs of €47.7 million  costs for early termination of collaborations of €46.1 million  impairment on fixed assets related to small molecules activities of €9.5 million  deal costs of €14.8 million  €4.6 million additional accelerated non-cash cost recognition for subscription right plans and €2.1 million other operating expenses.Total net revenues amounted to €1 112.2 million in 2025  compared to €275.6 million last year. The revenue recognition related to the exclusive access rights granted to Gilead under the OLCA 3 for the Galapagos’ drug discovery platform amounted to €1 069.0 million in 2025  compared to €230.2 million in 2024. It was assessed based on the intention to wind down and on the facts and circumstances on December 31  2025  that the deferred income balance allocated to the Company’s drug discovery platform is no longer justified in the 2025 IFRS financial statements  leading to full recognition of the deferred income at December 31  2024  as revenue. For the avoidance of doubt  the OLCA remains in effect.

Impairment of the cell therapy activities is a result of the Company’s previously announced strategic alternatives process for the cell therapy activities whereby the Company assessed the cell therapy activities associated assets’ recoverable amount in accordance with IAS 36. The recoverable amount was estimated lower than the assets’ carrying value. As a result  the Company recognized an impairment loss of €228.1 million  thereby aligning the cell therapy assets’ book value with the Company’s strategic decision to wind down the cell therapy activities  which resulted in a full impairment of both the associated goodwill and intangible assets and a partial impairment of property  plant and equipment.is a result of the Company’s previously announced strategic alternatives process for the cell therapy activities whereby the Company assessed the cell therapy activities associated assets’ recoverable amount in accordance with IAS 36.

Other operating income of €40.8 million in 2024 increased to €53.5 million in 2025  mainly driven by the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration payable of €21.8 million  partly offset by lower grant and R&D incentives income.Net financial income in 2025 amounted to €5.8 million  compared to net financial income of €185.2 million in 2024.Fair value adjustments and net currency exchange results amounted to a negative amount of €39.4 million in 2025  compared to fair value adjustments and net currency exchange gains in 2024 of €95.8 million. They were primarily attributable to €18.3 million of negative changes in fair value of current financial investments  and to €44.8 million of unrealized currency exchange losses on cash and cash equivalents and current financial investments at amortized cost in U.S. dollars  partly offset by a positive effect of €22.7 million as consequence of the settlement of a hedging instrument.amounted to a negative amount of €39.4 million in 2025  compared to fair value adjustments and net currency exchange gains in 2024 of €95.8 million.

Net other financial income in 2025 amounted to €45.2 million  compared to net other financial income of €89.4 million in 2024. Net interest income amounted to €45.3 million in 2025 compared to €88.5 million of net interest income in 2024  due to a decrease in the interest rates and a shift from investments in term deposits generating financial income to investments in money market funds generating fair value changes. Fair value gains and interest income derived from cash  cash equivalents and financial investments excluding any currency exchange results amounted to €103.0 million in 2025 (compared to €140.4 million in 2024).Galapagos had €18.6 million of tax income in 2025  compared to €1.8 million of tax income in 2024. The increase is mainly explained by the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities linked to capitalized intangible assets related to the cell therapy activities  as the Company recorded an impairment on these intangible assets. Galapagos did not incur a current tax liability in 2025 because the profit of the year is fully absorbed by current year tax deductions.The Company reported a net profit from continuing operations in 2025 of €319.5 million  compared to a net loss from its continuing operations of €1.3 million in 2024.Net profit from discontinued operations related to Jyseleca® amounted to €1.4 million  compared to net profit amounting to €75.4 million in 2024. The net result for discontinued operations included €11.7 million of R&D expenses primarily related to the final settlement of disputed expenses with Alfasigma  and €11.9 million of other operating income related to a fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration receivable from Alfasigma as a consequence of an adjusted sales forecast. The operating profit from discontinued operations in 2024  was mainly related to the gain on the sale of the Jyseleca® business to Alfasigma of €52.3 million.Galapagos reported a net profit in 2025 of €320.9 million  compared to a net profit of €74.1 million in 2024.Cash and financial investmentsCash and financial investments totaled €2 998.0 million on December 31  2025  as compared to €3 317.8 million on December 31  2024.

The fee reduction positions BITC competitively with the lowest-cost Bitcoin ETPs available globally  including recent entrants to the European market.""This fee reduction reflects our conviction that accessible pricing must be structural  not promotional "" said Jean-Marie Mognetti  CEO and Co-Founder of CoinShares. ""We launched Europe's first Bitcoin ETP in 2015 with a clear mission: to make digital asset investment accessible to all investors through familiar  regulated structures. As the European leader in digital asset investment  we are passing the benefits of our scale directly to our clients. This is not a fee holiday: it is a permanent commitment to competitive pricing that reinforces our market leadership.""Strategic RationaleThe European Bitcoin ETP market has undergone significant transformation over the past twelve months  with new entrants and intensifying fee competition. CoinShares' decision to reduce BITC's management fee to 0.15% reflects the Group's ability to leverage its vertically integrated infrastructure  operational efficiency  and market-leading scale to deliver institutional-grade products at increasingly competitive price points.Commitment to Quality and AccessibilityCoinShares has consistently maintained that broad adoption of digital assets as an investment class requires two elements: institutional-quality products and accessible pricing. The BITC fee reduction advances both objectives.""Our investors  whether portfolio managers  wealth advisors  or self-directed retail clients  deserve access to Bitcoin exposure at fee levels that reflect the maturity of this market "" said Romain Barrot  Head of European ETP Products at CoinShares. ""BITC now offers one of the most competitive fee structures among established  physically-backed Bitcoin ETPs in Europe  without compromising on the security  liquidity  or operational standards our clients expect.""Product DetailsProduct: CoinShares Bitcoin ETPTicker: BITCISIN: GB00BLD4ZL17Structure: Physically-backedNew Management Fee: 0.15% (15 bps)Effective Date: Immediate:Listings: Xetra  SIX Swiss Exchange  Euronext Paris  Euronext Amsterdam  LSE  Borsa ItalianaAbout CoinSharesCoinShares is a leading global digital asset manager that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment management  trading  and securities to a wide array of clients that include corporations  financial institutions  and individuals.

At its meeting held on 20 February 2026  the Company’ Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for 2025.“I am pleased to report our 2025 performance  which shows strong growth  sustained profitability improvement and solid free cash flow generation.Exosens continues to pursue its strategy as a technology platform focused on critical  high value-added applications where photonics is a key differentiating factor. In Defense  we continued to benefit from a very strong market demand  underpinned by the signing with the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) of the largest night vision contract secured to date. We also saw a marked acceleration in requirements for Defense imaging applications and  in particular  in Surveillance  where fast-evolving drone threat landscape represents a major structural shift. 2025 also marked the launch of our state-of-the-art 5G image intensifier tube  as well as the launch of significant capacity expansion programs to be effective from 2027 onward in Europe and  for the first time  in the United States  where we see significant business opportunities. Our commercial markets experienced more contrasted trends: Life Sciences were impacted by geopolitical and trade-related uncertainties  Industrial Control recorded improving level of activity after two more subdued years  enabling Exosens to secure several notable commercial successes  while Nuclear continues to undergo rapid transformation  driven by growing demand for carbon-free energy. We expect all of these markets to continue benefiting from structural growth drivers  supported in particular by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence  positioning Exosens for sustained long-term growth. In terms of external growth  we completed three acquisitions during the year  expanding our addressable market in Surveillance  accelerating innovation in drone-based and man-portable night vision systems  and broadening our technology portfolio into wavefront sensing.Looking ahead  we intend to pursue our profitable growth trajectory  leveraging our technological expertise  our diversified product offering addressing the critical needs of our customers  and the structural growth trends of the markets we serve. This strategy underpins our confidence in delivering a strong performance in 2026. In addition  over the medium term  we expect to deliver solid average annual organic revenue growth of up to the mid-teens  alongside further profitability improvement and robust free cash flow generation.Exosens remains fully committed to serving all its customers. Our technological expertise and strong performance culture remain the backbone of the Group and the foundation of our values of entrepreneurship  teamwork  respect  trust and innovation. We will continue to pursue a technology-driven differentiation strategy in selected  growing markets  within a favorable industrial and geopolitical environment  delivering sensors that protect and prevent by revealing what is invisible to the human eye.”  commented Jérôme Cerisier  CEO of Exosens.Key financial indicators 5 6In € millions 2024 2025 Change (%) Revenue 383.4 468.2 +22.1% Adjusted gross margin 188.4 234.0 +24.2% As a % of revenue 49.1% 50.0% +84Bps Adjusted EBITDA 119.8 151.6 +26.6% As a % of revenue 31.2% 32.4% +115Bps Adjusted EBIT 97.9 127.6 +30.3% As a % of revenue 25.5% 27.3% +172Bps Operating income 76.8 102.0 +32.9% As a % of revenue 20.0% 21.8% +177Bps Net profit from continued operations 34.1 70.2 +106.0% Net profit from continued op. ex.

Consolidated revenue stood at €468.2 million  recording a sustained growth of +22.1% (+€84.8 million) compared with €383.4 million in 2024  and exceeding the Group's guidance. This increase reflected the scope effect from the integration of acquisitions completed in H2 2024 and 2025  as well as strong like-for-like growth  with revenue up by +12.7% year-on-year  mainly driven by the strength of the Defense and Surveillance end markets (which accounted for 75% of Group revenue in 2025).AMPLIFICATIONAmplification revenue amounted to €319.2 million (68% of Group sales) in 2025  reflecting a sustained growth of +18.4% (+€49.6 million) compared with €269.6 million in 2024. This increase reflected higher sales volumes  driven by expanded production capacity and strong demand for intensifier tubes for Defense night vision applications  improved yields and a favorable product mix  as well as the contribution of NVLS acquisition (man-portable night vision and thermal devices).Business reviewAs defense priorities evolve amid heightened geopolitical tensions  the increasing focus on night vision operational superiority is fueling global demand for night vision goggles. In this fast-moving market  Exosens leverages its position as the strategic supplier of high-performance  ITAR-free image intensifier tubes to NATO members and tier-1 allies. End users continue to accelerate procurement of night vision systems  as evidenced by a series of major business wins  especially in Europe. Most notably  in late 2025  Exosens announced the signing of an unprecedented contract  in partnership with Theon International  with OCCAR7 to supply the German armed-forces. This contract embeds 200 000 16mm tubes  for a total value of more than €500 million  for deliveries from 2027 to 2029.The Group estimates that night vision goggle equipment rates will remain well below end users’ target levels over the mid-term horizon. Europe is therefore expected to remain a strong growth market for the foreseeable future  further supported by large-scale programs currently underway or planned in the U.S. and the APAC region.As global demand continues to strengthen and in light of NATO members’ planned defense budget increases toward the 3.5% of GDP target  Exosens announced in 2025 a €37 million investment plan to expand production capacity in both Europe and the U.S.  targeting a 40% increase by 2027 across the 16mm  18mm and 5G product families. This plan is designed to further strengthen the Group's global footprint  enabling it to meet growing global demand for night vision systems and to capture additional market opportunities  particularly in the U.S.  where the rollout of the new manufacturing facility is underway  with key equipment already ordered and initial personnel hires completed.Product innovationIn a rapidly evolving threat environment where technological superiority is critical  the Group remains at the forefront of innovation with the launch of 5G image intensifier tubes  representing a major technological breakthrough in night vision. The 5G technology sets new performance benchmarks in image quality  observation range and luminous gain  delivering +30% overall performance improvement and up to +35% increase in detection range compared with current standards. Exosens will be the only supplier capable of delivering this level of technology to NATO members  further cementing its role as their strategic night vision partner. The 5G has already seen rapid market adoption  resulting in sizeable orders  as illustrated by the signing in January 2026 of a major contract with ACTinBlack for the supply of more than 7 000 5G tubes  to be delivered across 2027 and 2028 and integrated into night vision goggles for European special forces end users.Business developmentIn 2025  Exosens successfully completed the acquisition of NVLS  a Spain-based specialist in man-portable night vision and thermal devices. This transaction expands the Group's total addressable market and enhances its ability to deliver high-end night vision goggles to end users  leveraging advanced technological capabilities that combine sensors and optics to meet evolving requirements of the soldier of the future. Following this acquisition  Exosens announced a major contract with the Spanish army for the supply of 17 000 advanced night vision monoculars by NVLS  incorporating its 16mm 4G intensifier tubes  with deliveries scheduled between 2025 and 2028. This landmark contract highlights NVLS’ contribution to European sovereignty by strengthening its industrial capacity as a leading Spanish supplier of night vision equipment for dismounted soldiers.Moreover  in line with its strategy to focus resources on higher-value activities closely aligned with its long-term priorities  the Group decided to divest its Microwave Amplifier business. The transaction was completed on 31 December 2025 and is expected to have a positive impact on Exosens' profitability and cash generation profile.DETECTION & IMAGINGDetection & Imaging revenue amounted to €150.5 million (32% of Group sales) in 2025  representing a sustained growth of +28.0% (+€33.0 million) compared with €117.5 million in 2024  lifted by the contribution of acquisitions completed in H2 2024 (Centronic  LR Tech) and 2025 (Noxant  Phasics). On a like-for-like basis  D&I delivered robust 2025 performance (LFL +5.4%)  with LFL growth strengthening throughout the year and a particularly strong Q4 2025 (LFL +15.9%)  due to sustained momentum in the Defense & Surveillance markets.D&I Defense & Surveillance (10% of Group sales)Momentum in the Defense & Surveillance markets has continued to strengthen  with digital imaging becoming increasingly mission-critical in high-density modern warfare  driven by the increasing adoption of optronic technologies for platform-based applications and the emergence of drone and counter-drone systems as a core pillar of evolving conflict dynamics. These areas represent a compelling growth avenue  reinforcing our positioning in next-generation defense capabilities  notably in support of European sovereignty.In this context  Exosens can rely on its comprehensive portfolio of advanced sensors and imaging systems for situational awareness  threat detection and tracking  and targeting  spanning multi-domain and multi-spectral capabilities  underpinned by its strong Defense DNA and deep expertise in mission-critical applications  to fuel its commercial momentum. As a result  the adoption of Exosens' technologies is accelerating among leading OEMs and autonomous systems developers  notably for advanced drone-based applications.D&I Commercial Markets (22% of Group sales)In Industrial Control  the market has shown early signs of recovery  supported by a restart of capital expenditure spending and the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. AI-led technologies are fueling demand of advanced optical and multispectral imaging systems for real-time machine vision and predictive process monitoring  semiconductor inspection  as well as power grid and high-voltage transmission line maintenance.In Life Sciences  reduced U.S. academic research and biomedical funding led to weaker demand for electron and optical microscopy  while global inventory drawdowns resulted in temporarily lower demand for mass spectrometry detectors. Fast-evolving technology requirements across the industry are expected to drive market growth  driven by a shift toward higher-performance mass spectrometry systems and increased private-sector R&D  notably in low-carbon materials and semiconductor testing.Lastly  in Nuclear  demand for carbon-free energy has continued to grow globally  driven by the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centers and their unprecedented power needs. In this context  demand for high-performance SMR-specific technologies has remained strong  with the Group involved in a number of major SMR projects in the U.S.  Europe and Asia  supporting longer-term business opportunities.Business developmentsIn 2025  Exosens successfully completed two bolt-on acquisitions  reinforcing its portfolio of advanced imaging solutions and expanding its addressable market: Noxant  a specialist in high-performance cooled infrared cameras  notably for drone-based Defense and Surveillance applications  and Phasics  a leader in wavefront sensing technology for Defense  Industrial Control and Life Sciences.Strong improvement in adjusted gross margin  up +24.2% in 20252024 2025 Change In €m % of sales In €m % of sales In €m In % Amplification 131.2 48.7% 161.4 50.5% +30.1 +23.0% Detection & Imaging 57.1 48.6% 72.7 48.3% +15.5 +27.2% Eliminations & Other 0.1 nm — nm (0.1) nm Adjusted gross margin 188.4 49.1% 234.0 50.0% +45.6 +24.2%Exosens recorded a strong increase in adjusted gross margin at Group level  driven by higher sales volumes  improved yields  and a favorable product mix. The Group's adjusted gross margin stood at €234.0 million in 2025  reflecting a sustained growth of +24.2% (+€45.6 million) compared with €188.4 million in 2024. As a percentage of revenue  adjusted gross margin rose by +84 basis points to 50.0% in 2025 (versus 49.1% in 2024).Adjusted gross margin for the Amplification segment amounted to €161.4 million in 2025  marking a strong growth of +23.0% (+€30.1 million) compared with €131.2 million in 2024.

Consequently  the Group's operating margin widened by +175 basis points to 21.8% in 2025 (versus 20.0% in 2024)  driven by a stronger operating leverage and the normalization of non-recurring expenses  as the prior-year included €(3.9) million of IPO-related one-off costs.More than twofold increase in net profit from continued operations in 2025Exosens posted a net profit from continued operations of €70.2 million in 2025 compared with €34.1 million in 2024  representing a strong increase of +106.0% (+€36.1 million). This sharp improvement primarily reflected the Group’s new capital structure following the IPO  resulting in lower financial costs. Adjusted for PPA amortization  net profit from continued operations totaled €84.2 million in 2025 (+€40.3 million).Net profit of €42.7 million in 2025  up +39.2%Net loss from continued operations amounted to €27.5 million in 2025 compared with €3.4 million in 2024  reflecting the net loss recognized on the sale of Microwave Amplifier assets  primarily non-cash. Consequently  the Group recorded a net profit of €42.7 million in 2025  up by +39.2% (+€12.0 million) from €30.7 million in 2024. Adjusted for PPA amortization  net profit totaled €56.7 million in 2025 (+€16.2 million).Robust free cash flow generation in 2025Exosens generated free cash flow of €57.3 million in 2025 (versus €58.7 million in 2024)  in spite of higher working capital requirements  mainly driven by increased inventory levels to support strong top-line growth. In addition  the Group achieved a cash conversion rate of 73.6% in 2025 (versus 73.4% in 2024)  in line with full-year guidance of 70%-75%  reflecting effective cash management despite higher investments to support future growth.Sustained R&D efforts in 2025 supporting innovation capabilitiesGross R&D expenses amounted to €35.7 million (7.6% of sales) in 2025  marking a strong increase of +19.8% (+€5.9 million) compared with 2024. The Group pursued its sustained R&D effort to support product innovation  including cutting-edge 5G image intensifier tubes for night vision applications  as well as advanced detectors and imaging systems for Defense and Surveillance  Industrial Control  Life Sciences and Nuclear markets.
