(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) acquired AURA Technologie GmbH in Germany for €10 million in a transaction consisting of 34% cash and 66% AMG shares. The acquisition represents a major strategic step in AMG’s expansion into high-purity molybdenum and strengthens its position in circular critical materials processing.AURA is an established processor of spent hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts  which contain molybdenum as a key active component. The transaction provides AMG with an operational platform and experienced team  accelerating the commercialization of AMG’s proprietary molybdenum refining technology.“This acquisition marks the launch of AMG’s circular high-purity molybdenum business ” said Michael Connor  AMG’s Chief Corporate Development Officer. “We plan to invest approximately $40 million to expand AURA’s existing facility and integrate AMG’s proprietary technology to produce high-purity molybdenum suitable for use in fresh refinery catalysts.AMG’s recycled high-purity molybdenum has already been successfully tested and approved by potential customers. We are seeing strong interest and expect to secure meaningful offtake agreements as we scale production. Once established  this platform offers significant global replication potential.”Molybdenum is a critical input for HDS catalysts used by refineries worldwide to remove sulfur from fuels and natural gas  playing a central role in clean fuel production. Global demand for secure  Western sources of critical materials continue to grow as supply chain resilience becomes a strategic priority.AURA operates a fully permitted facility in Saxony-Anhalt  Germany  with extensive expertise in sourcing and roasting spent HDS catalysts. By combining AURA’s operational platform with AMG’s advanced refining capabilities  AMG is creating a vertically integrated circular value chain that transforms spent catalysts into high-value  high-purity molybdenum products.This transaction further expands AMG’s portfolio of recycling-based critical materials businesses and reinforces its strategy of combining proprietary process technology with circular feedstocks to generate resilient  high-margin growth.AURA Invest  the seller of the company  is controlled by AMG's CEO Dr. Schimmelbusch. Because of the related party aspect of this transaction  AMG took great care with the acquisition process.

In this context  the Company will  as of today  file for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company's activity under the best possible conditions  protect employees  and preserve jobs  while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework.This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business  renegotiate its debts  and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.The employee representative organisations were informed of this decision on 24 February 2026.The Court  at a hearing expected in early March  will rule on this request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”).Pending this decision and given the uncertainties regarding the outcome of the proceedings  the suspension of the Company's share price  announced on 20 February 2026  remains in effect.The Company will keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.About judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”)Judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) are collective procedures that freeze existing liabilities at the opening of the procedure for the duration of the observation period  which can last up to 18 months. This procedure enables the debtor to present a continuation plan for its activities by restructuring its debt and ensures its recovery.* (“Déclaration de cessation des paiements”)** (“Redressement judiciaire”)ABOUT NACONIFRS REVENUE 2024/2025: €167.9 MOPERATING PROFIT 2024/2025: €1.1 MWORKFORCEMore than 1 000 employeesINTERNATIONAL25 subsidiaries and a distribution network in 100 countrieshttps://corporate.nacongaming.com/NACON is a BIGBEN group company established in 2019 to optimize its expertise with strong synergy in the video game market.

Poland remains one of the largest economies in Central and Eastern Europe  supported by sustained economic growth and rising household savings.At the same time  interest in crypto assets continues to develop among retail investors across Europe. However  access to regulated  exchange-listed crypto investment products in Poland has so far been limited.The introduction of physically backed crypto ETPs on the Warsaw Stock Exchange provides a transparent and institutionally structured alternative - enabling investors to gain crypto exposure within Poland’s established brokerage and regulatory framework.Christopher Kock  CEO of Virtune:“Entering Poland has been a strategic priority for Virtune for more than two years. Today’s listing represents a historic milestone and an important step in the continued development of the Polish capital markets. For the first time  spot crypto ETPs are available on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.We see this as part of a broader development of Poland’s financial markets. As retail participation and interest in exchange-traded products continue to grow  we believe innovative and transparent investment solutions can play an important role in deepening market engagement.Our ambition is to contribute to the long-term development of the Polish capital market - not only by introducing digital asset exposure  but by supporting broader participation  education and product innovation. We are here to build for the long term.”Institutional-Grade Structure and TransparencyAll Virtune ETPs are 100% physically backed by the underlying crypto assets.Key structural features include:Assets held in segregated custody with Coinbase  the world’s largest crypto custodianThe underlying crypto assets are stored in cold-storage (offline)Chainlink Proof of Reserves technology providing transparent verification of underlying crypto asset holdingsThis structure is designed to provide high levels of security  transparency and investor protection within a regulated framework.Raiffeisen Bank International AG has been appointed as market maker for Virtune’s crypto ETP listings on the Warsaw Stock Exchange  initially covering the four products admitted to trading at launch.As market maker  Raiffeisen Bank International AG will provide continuous liquidity by quoting buy and sell prices in the ETPs on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.A Proven European Track RecordSince launching its first crypto ETP in 2023  Virtune has expanded rapidly across regulated European exchanges. Virtune is today one of Europe’s fastest-growing crypto asset managers.Approximately USD 260 million in assets under managementTrusted by more than 160 000 investors22 listed crypto ETPsListings on six regulated European exchanges  including the Warsaw Stock Exchange  Nasdaq Stockholm  Nasdaq Helsinki  Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Paris and Xetra in FrankfurtIn 2025  Virtune held approximately 95% of crypto ETN trading volume on Nasdaq Nordics  demonstrating strong liquidity and investor engagement.The expansion into Poland represents a major strategic commitment for Virtune  involving substantial investment and long-term engagement in the Polish capital market.Beyond listing products  Virtune intends to actively contribute to the development of the market by increasing awareness and understanding of both crypto assets and exchange-traded products. Virtune sees investor education and transparent communication as essential components of building a sustainable and well-functioning market.Michał Kobza  Member of the Management Board  Warsaw Stock Exchange Quote:""The debut of Virtune AB’s products is another step in developing our ETF  ETC and ETN offering. This segment is growing dynamically due to strong investor interest  and our role as the WSE is to respond to market expectations — enabling investors to access crypto-assets through regulated and supervised exchange‑traded instruments provides them with real value.""Filip Kaczmarzyk – XTB’s Head of Trading and Board Member:“In recent years  interest in investing in Poland has grown significantly. Among younger generations in particular  conscious financial management is becoming increasingly mainstream. More individuals are actively seeking effective ways to allocate their capital  including through long-term investment vehicles such as IKE and IKZE. Our data further confirms that long-term investing continues to gain strong momentum. At the same time  cryptocurrencies remain especially popular among younger investors. Until recently  however  gaining exposure to this asset class often required the use of foreign platforms or less established crypto exchanges—options that many Polish investors found less appealing than domestic brokerage houses. This is now changing. The growing number of ETPs listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and traded in Polish złoty allows investors to gain crypto exposure through trusted  regulated local institutions.”Press ContactChristopher KockCEO  Virtune AB (publ)christopher@virtune.com+46 70 073 45 64About VirtuneVirtune  headquartered in Stockholm  is a regulated Swedish digital asset manager and issuer of crypto exchange-traded products listed on regulated European exchanges.With regulatory compliance  strategic collaborations with industry leaders and our proficient team  we empower investors on a global level to access innovative and sophisticated investment products that are aligned with the evolving landscape of the global crypto market.For more information  please visit www.virtune.com .Marketing from Virtune AB.

The product will be available for trading on 26 February 2026.Name Ticker ISIN Exchange Currency Fee Listing Date Issuer 21shares Strategy Yield ETP STRC NA CH1528107811 Euronext Amsterdam USD 0.00% 26 February 2026 21Shares AGSTRC marks an important milestone for 21shares as the firm’s first ETP providing exposure to an equity-related instrument. By offering exchange-traded access to a preferred security issued by Strategy Inc.  a software company and the world’s leading corporate holder of bitcoin  21shares is expanding beyond direct token exposure while remaining firmly anchored in the digital asset ecosystem.The underlying asset  STRC – the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock issued by Strategy Inc. – offers investors yield-enhanced exposure linked to Strategy’s bitcoin-centric reserve policy.STRC provides a high income stream  generated through variable distributions that have been paid consistently since issuance. Strategy has established a bitcoin and USD reserve with distribution coverage of 50+ years. The distribution rate is reviewed monthly and includes a floor linked to short-term interest rates  helping keep yield aligned with market conditions.Strategy Inc. holds over 700 000 bitcoin as of early 2026  representing approximately 3% of total bitcoin supply. As the largest corporate bitcoin holder globally  Strategy provides a uniquely positioned balance sheet within the digital asset ecosystem. Through the 21shares Strategy Yield  investors gain structured exposure to this bitcoin-backed digital yield via a preferred security that ranks senior to common equity in the capital structure.STRC has been structured by Strategy to trade close to its USD 100 par value  with regular distribution adjustments intended to support price stability. While not immune to credit  liquidity  or broader market risks  preferred securities have historically exhibited lower volatility than common equity or cryptocurrencies.“The 21shares Strategy Yield ETP reflects 21shares’ commitment to innovation and ambition to lead as our first ETP linked to an equity-related instrument ” said Duncan Moir  President at 21shares. “Since our inception  we have focused on providing straightforward access to digital assets. With this product  we are extending that expertise into equity-linked exposure tied to the bitcoin ecosystem. By combining high income potential with a familiar exchange traded structure  STRC offers both institutional and retail investors an efficient and accessible way to add yield to their portfolios.”“STRC is an innovation in the capital markets that provides the upside of a bitcoin-backed security  with the stability of a traditional credit product ” said Phong Le  President and CEO of Strategy. “It currently offers 11.25% yield1  paid monthly in cash  tax deferred. Through 21shares’ exchange-traded product  we’re expanding access for European investors to a new capital model – one that didn’t exist five years ago and one we believe will help shape the next fifty.”The 21shares Strategy Yield ETP provides exchange-traded access to STRC through a listed product structure  removing the operational complexity of trading individual preferred shares directly. Investors can gain exposure through a familiar ETP format within their existing brokerage accounts.Notes to editorsAbout 21shares21shares is one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange traded product (ETP) providers and offers one of the largest suites of crypto ETPs in the market.

The Company stated it was considering resorting to procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court.In this context  the Company announces that it will file today a request for the opening of an amicable conciliation procedure with the President of the Court. The purpose of this procedure is to enable the Company  under the guidance of a conciliator  to engage in discussions with its financial creditors (in particular  bondholders and banking creditors) regarding the restructuring of its financial debt and  if necessary  the securing of new financial resources  within a stable and legally secure framework.This request for the opening of an amicable conciliation procedure concerns the financial debt of the legal entity Bigben Interactive (mainly bond debt) and does not involve operational creditors (such as suppliers). It will have no impact on operations  employees  or customers  and the Company will be able to continue its activities. Initiated at the Company's request  this procedure will allow for constructive dialogue with its financial partners to reach an agreement.It will be for the President of the Court  in the coming days  to rule on this request to initiate a conciliation procedure.The suspension of trading in the financial instruments issued by the Company (shares and bonds)  announced on 20 February 2026  remains in place. It should be noted that the Company's principal asset is its majority stake in Nacon  in which it currently holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights. Today  Nacon has notified the market that it has filed for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) and requesting the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) before the Court. Trading in Nacon shares is suspended pending the Court's decision  expected at the beginning of March 2026  and in the interests of the market  trading in the Company's financial instruments will likewise remain suspended for the duration of the suspension of Nacon's share trading.The Company will keep the market informed as the situation evolves and as the procedure progresses.IFRS REVENUE 2024-25: €288 MHEADCOUNTMore than 1 300 employeesINTERNATIONAL36 subsidiaries and a distribution network in over 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben is a European player in video game publishing  the design and distribution of mobile and gaming accessories  as well as audio-video products.

France total admissions in our hospitals rose year-on-year reflecting sustained patient need for healthcare and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more quality care services in a competitive landscape: +2.5% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics) patient stays admissions driven by ambulatory care. Our French facilities managed approximately 350 000 emergency presentations this half-year confirming their major role in delivering on public service missions. (i) This growth of admissions combined with (ii) a limited price effect of +0 5% MSO tariff increase from March 2025 has been partly offset by (iii) a negative mix effect from higher growth of day patient volumes vs inpatient stays and (iv) as well as c. €2m impact of price cuts on imaging procedures.French total revenue growth also reflects the opening of 3 mental health day facilities in the period  the installation of 6 new imaging equipment since July 2025.Nordic countries reported total revenue grew by +6.4% benefitting from €26.4m (or 3.4%) favourable foreign exchange rate fluctuation (appreciation of SEK vs EUR versus the prior year period). Organic revenue growth in the Nordics was +2.8% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate. There was a solid organic growth in Sweden underpinned by primary care activity benefitting from a long-term increasing trend of listed patients  additional volumes from light emergency centres taken over since January 2025 and increased remuneration for extended care responsibility assumed; as well as growing volumes in St Göran with a reducing length of stay and the continued ramp-up of its new maternity  and sustained demand in our Swedish elderly care and orthopaedics clinics.EBITDARamsay Santé Group's consolidated EBITDA has stabilised at €284.8m (or +0.1% year-on-year).The Group's EBITDA growth has been negatively impacted by the end of the French government's revenue guarantee from 1 January 2025  representing a €20m shortfall vs. the same period last year. Public funding otherwise received through French tariff increases and various public payors in the Nordics still only partially covered inflation from medical staff salary and wages as well as overall procurement and outsourced services price increases  putting pressure on operating margins.Productivity efforts and cost control across all geographies already initiated last year have been reinforced and were essential for the Group operations to offset cost inflation and maintain EBITDA stable compared to the same time last year. The corresponding actions range from increasing staffing productivity  optimising medical purchases and consumption  to saving on administrative costs and carefully adjusting hiring structure (eg. agency staff)  while also pursuing revenue development initiatives such as in day medicine and imaging.Operating profit and non-current itemsUnderlying current operating profit amounted to €67.8m  up €1.7m year-on-year. Higher leased assets depreciation expense arising from the effect of rent indexation and the impact of a stronger SEK vs the EUR were offset by lower fixed assets depreciation.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net expense of €5.1m  including:facilities restructuring costs and fees for €2.1m transaction and integration costs for €2.0m loss on assets disposal for €0.9m.The previous year period shows a €3.9m expense mainly composed of facilities restructuring charges.Financial result and net result after taxThe cost of net financial debt amounted to €90.8m  vs. €95.8m in the previous comparable period. The lower interest costs result from the decrease in the senior debt margin post February 2025 refinancing in this period  and old borrowing costs write-off in the prior period further to the August 2024 refinancing.Other financial income and expenses amount to €2.2m vs. €9.0m in December 2024 which included a €7.2m expense from non-cash mark to market movements on an interest rate swap hedging arrangement (this impact did not reoccur since as this particular swap matured in October 2024).The Group’s share of net loss for the half year ended 31 December 2025 amounted to €(34.9)m  improving €8.2m from the net loss of €(43.1)m in December 2024.Restated aggregates:Reported EBITDA of €284.8m (+€0.2m vs. last half-year) in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted operating or non-financial lease expenses for €138.5m (vs. €134.3m last year) which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt.

This results mainly from the repayment of all French State cash advances (extended due to the late publication of March 2025 tariffs) that were still outstanding as at 30 June 2025.Tangible and intangible capital expenditure net of disposals of €75.3m for this half-year is lower than last half-year’s €78.2m thanks to tighter selection of capex proposals. It included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics and imaging equipment. The Group actively manages its portfolio of assets and where practical reallocates capital to its development priorities.The financing cash outflow of the period is reduced by €85.6m overall including notably a €35m new debt drawn by refinancing the Mermoz real estate in France (€65m new mortgage loan less €31m lease acquisition option payment)  and €11m borrowing costs paid as part of last year’s refinancing not reoccurring.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €205.9m on 31 December 2025 and reported IFRS net debt was €3 757.1m compared with €3 647.5m on 30 June 2025. Restated net debt amounts to €1 845.2m compared with €1 675.4m on 30 June 2025. Restated net leverage amounts to 5.3x at the end of December 2025  improving vs. 5.4x as of December 2024.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the European leader in private hospitalisation and primary care.

On November 24  2025  Bigben announced it had secured a refinancing agreement with a banking pool of leading French banks for €43 million  repayable over 6 years. This would have partially refinanced prior outstanding bonds  leaving a non-refinanced residual balance of approximately €16.1 million to be repaid separately on the maturity date.However  on February 13  2026  just four business days before the maturity date  the banking pool informed Bigben that it was refusing to honor the drawdown notice sent in connection with the refinancing  claiming it could invoke a breach by Bigben for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. Bigben strongly disputed this legal analysis and reserved all its rights. The refusal was described as both unexpected and late  leaving Bigben (and  therefore  Nacon) with almost no time to find an alternative.Unable to proceed with the partial repayment of the aforementioned €43 million  last week Bigben announced the temporary suspension of trading in its shares on Euronext Paris and its bonds on Euronext Access Paris. NACON  as a subsidiary  had its own shares suspended simultaneously.Today  the two companies filed different court procedures reflecting their different situations. Bigben filed for an amicable conciliation procedure  stressing it would have no impact on operations  employees  or customers. Bigben also noted that its principal asset is its majority stake in NACON  in which it holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights.NACON's situation appears to be more severe  though. Unable to meet its own liabilities as a direct consequence of the parent company's crisis  it filed for full judicial reorganisation proceedings. This freezes existing liabilities for an observation period of up to 18 months while the company attempts to develop a continuation plan. Essentially  NACON has formally acknowledged that it cannot meet its current liabilities. The procedure gives it court protection while it attempts to restructure  but the outcome is  at this point  genuinely uncertain.

This growth was driven by solid underlying trends across most businesses and geographies.: organic revenue growth was up 6.5% compared to full year 2024  with a 6.3% increase in the fourth quarter of 2025. This growth was driven by solid underlying trends across most businesses and geographies. Geographical breakdown: Americas (25% of revenue): the Americas region posted solid growth  with organic revenue up 4.0%. This reflects strong momentum in North American data centers and energy markets  along with healthy activity levels across Latin America.

Middle East & Africa (10% of revenue): the Middle East & Africa region achieved very strong organic growth of 16.6%. It benefited from ongoing urbanization and infrastructure building programs as well as sustained energy investments in the Middle East.Positive scope effect: the scope effect had a positive 0.8% contribution to total growth. This was driven by bolt-on acquisitions completed in the past few quarters  contributing to a positive 2.9% impact. This was partly offset by divestments completed over the last twelve months  including the Food Testing business  representing a total reduction of 2.1%.the scope effect had a positive 0.8% contribution to total growth. This was driven by bolt-on acquisitions completed in the past few quarters  contributing to a positive 2.9% impact. This was partly offset by divestments completed over the last twelve months  including the Food Testing business  representing a total reduction of 2.1%. Negative currency impact: currency fluctuations had a negative impact of 3.7%  with a higher negative impact of 5.2% in the fourth quarter. This is due to the strength of the euro against most currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 5.7% to EUR 1 052.9 million (up 10.8% at constant currency)Full year adjusted operating profit increased by 5.7% to EUR 1 052.9 million and increased by 51 basis points at constant currency.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT IN EUR M ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS FY 2024 adjusted operating profit / margin 996.2 16.0% Organic change 111.7 +74bps Organic adjusted operating profit / margin 1 107.9 16.7% Scope (4.3) (23)bps Adjusted operating profit / margin at constant currency 1 103.6 16.5% Currency (50.8) (19)bps FY 2025 adjusted operating profit / margin 1 052.9 16.3%This represents an adjusted operating margin of 16.3%  up 32 basis points compared to the full year 2024:The adjusted operating margin increased organically by 74 basis points year-on-year to 16.7%  from higher operating leverage and functional scalability driven by the ongoing performance programs  and from a positive mix. By division  Buildings & Infrastructure  Agri-Food & Commodities  Marine & Offshore  and Consumer Product Services achieved higher margins offsetting margin contraction in Certification and Industry.Scope had a negative impact of (23) basis points  reflecting H1 2025 investments in the recently acquired companies to enable geographical expansion beyond existing markets and to develop new services addressing customers’ demand.Foreign exchange trends had a negative impact of (19) basis points on the Company’s margin due to the strength of the euro against other currencies.Other adjustment items represented a net expense of EUR 60.5 million versus a EUR 62.8 million expense in the full year of 2024  mainly driven by a EUR 34.7 million in net gain on disposals and acquisitions (net loss of EUR 0.8 million in FY 2024)  linked to the divestment of the Food testing activities. Other details are available in Appendix 6.Operating profit totaled EUR 992.4 million  up 6.3% compared to EUR 933.4 million in the full year of 2024.Adjusted EPS of EUR 1.42  up 2.8% year on year and 9.2% at constant currencyNet financial expense amounted to EUR 116.0 million in the full year of 2025  compared to EUR 69.6 million in the same period one year earlier. The difference in net finance costs amounting to EUR 66.4 million in 2025 compared to EUR 50.7 million in 2024 is mainly attributable to the decrease in income from cash and cash equivalents.In 2025  the Company recorded unfavorable exchange rate effects  with a loss of EUR 28.3 million (compared to a gain of EUR 5.9 million in FY 2024).Other items (including interest costs on pension plans and other financial expenses) stood at a negative EUR 21.3 million  compared to a negative EUR 24.8 million in FY 2024.Consolidated income tax expense stood at EUR 265.9 million in the full year of 2025. This included the impact of the exceptional contribution on large companies' profits in France  given that the portion based on the 2024 tax was fully recognized in 2025. For comparison  consolidated income tax expense was EUR 273.8 million in 2024.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR- income tax expense divided by profit before tax) of 30.4% for the period  versus 31.7% in FY 2024. The reduction observed is mainly linked to the divestment of the food testing activities favorably impacting the overall tax rate.The adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to 2024  to 30.0%. It corresponds to the effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effect of adjustment items. This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in the amount of withholding taxes incurred over the period.Attributable net profit for the period was EUR 588.0 million  versus EUR 569.4 million in FY 2024. Earnings per share (EPS) were EUR 1.32  compared to EUR 1.27 in FY 2024.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 631.4 million in 2025  up 1.7% versus EUR 620.7 million in FY 2024. Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 1.42 in FY 2025  and a 2.8% increase versus FY 2024 (EUR 1.38 per share) and of a 9.2% increase based on constant currencies.Free Cash Flow of EUR 824.2 million (-2.3% year-on-year  +3.9% organically)The 2025 operating cash flow was slightly up year-on-year at EUR 1 006.7 million versus EUR 1 004.8 million in FY 2024. This is due to working capital requirement inflow of EUR 19.1 million  compared to EUR 60.8 million of inflows in the previous year.The working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 236.8 million as of December 31  2025  compared to EUR 293.0 million as of December 31  2024. As a percentage of revenue  WCR decreased by 100 basis points to a low of 3.7%. This performance demonstrates the entire organization’s focus on cash deliverables.Purchases of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (net Capex)  amounted to EUR 141.8 million in 2025  a 1.4% increase from EUR 139.8 million in 2024. This result denotes strict control and reflects the divestment from capital-intensive Food testing  with the Company’s net capex-to-revenue ratio reaching 2.2%  stable compared to 2024.Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and net Capex) wasEUR 824.2 million  representing a 2.3% decrease from the previous year's record of EUR 843.3 million in 2024. This reflected the one-off effects related to the sale of the Food Testing business  including the income tax cash out on capital gain. On an organic basis  free cash flow rose 3.9% year-on-year.CHANGE IN FREE CASH FLOW IN EUR MILLION Free cash flow at December 31  2024 843.3 Organic change 33.2 Organic free cash flow 876.5 Scope (11.7) Free cash flow at constant currency 864.8 Currency (40.6) Free cash flow at December 31  2025 824.2Solid financial positionBureau Veritas has a solid financial structure.

The next refinancing of EUR 200 million is due in September 2026.At the end of December 2025  the Group’s adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio remained at a low level of 1.12x (vs.1.06x as of December 31  2024). The average maturity of the Company’s financial debt was 6.0 years  with a blended average cost of funds of 2.9% (excluding the impact of IFRS 16)  vs. 3.0% as of December 31  2024 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16).At December 31  2025  adjusted net financial debt was EUR 1 253.3 million. The increase in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 27.0 million (including the impact of debt from acquired companies) versus December 31  2024 (EUR 1 226.3 million) reflects:Free cash flow of EUR 824.2 million Dividend payments totaling EUR 430.0 million  including dividends paid to non-controlling interests and withholding taxes on intra-Company dividends Share buybacks net of transactions on treasury shares totaling EUR 177.3 million  as part of the Group’s LEAP | 28 strategy Net M&A payment  accounting for EUR 5.5 million.

Low single-digit contraction in Services (11% of divisional revenue) primarily from the reduction in non-core advisory services  which is expected to yield a positive impact for the segment in the upcoming quarters.The division sustained strong performance benefits from the maritime sector global fleet modernization and from the ongoing specialized ships expansion. The Group is actively developing new solutions to assist clients in addressing these needs. For example  it recently opened a global Gas Center of Excellence in Doha  Qatar  to provide comprehensive support for LNG development projects  as the energy industry expands its LNG fleet globally. The Center builds on existing capabilities in the key gas producing country of Qatar and leverages an existing extensive global technical network to clients anywhere in the world.In 2025  the adjusted operating margin remained broadly stable at 23.4% on a reported basis  supported by a solid organic impact of 67 basis points attributable to a favorable product mix  offset by a negative currency impact of 66 basis points.Green objects highlightsIn the last quarter of 2025  Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore provided comprehensive classification services  and supported final trials for a new-generation  low-carbon wind-powered vessel for a French shipping company  the first commercial sailing cargo ship of its kind to enter service.It also classed its first methanol-fueled containership for a leading shipping company.

The Middle East and Africa achieved solid growth from new contracts. Non‑trade services continued to grow from increased demand for biofuels  marine fuels  and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)  and from new laboratory capabilities.The Metals & Minerals segment (37% of divisional revenue) delivered strong growth in 2025  up high single-digit organically  driven primarily by robust activity in copper and gold. Upstream activities continued to post double‑digit growth  supported by sustained mining capex  increased exploration work  and the expansion of onsite laboratory outsourcing. All active regions achieved robust growth with copper activity as the main catalyst. During the year  the sub-segment expanded its footprint in Chile to reach an active 10‑laboratory platform  strengthening its expertise and capacity in the copper market. Trade operations recorded a strong year‑on‑year growth across the Americas  the Middle East and African markets  underpinned by higher volumes as metal prices remained firm.The Agri business (14% of divisional revenue) experienced an organic revenue contraction in 2025.The Agri sub-segment  suffered from weak business performance in its largest Brazilian operations. The Middle East and Africa region delivered strong growth  driven by a continued expansion of cocoa and cotton value chains in West Africa. Finally  in line with LEAP I 28 plans  the Group completed the sale of its entire Food Testing business in 2025. This divestment should be accretive to the divisional margin on a twelve-month basis.Government services (16% of divisional revenue) posted a mid-single-digit organic growth in the year driven by contract ramp-ups in the Middle East and North Africa  and expanded scopes in Southeast Asia. In line with LEAP I 28 performance programs  this subdivision has successfully completed the digitalization of all inspection workflows by utilizing solely digital tools  with a third of operations conducted remotely. This helped improve efficiency  transparency  and service quality.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities division increased by 117 basis points to 15.1%  compared to a low 13.9% in the prior year. This improvement is the result of effective performance programs  such as digital inspection workflows in Government services  and rapid growth in profitable segments like Metals & Minerals.Green objects highlightsIn the last quarter of 2025  in the field of green fuels  the Oil & Petrochemicals segment secured a testing services contract for a major energy company’s biodiesel facility in Belgium  ensuring full sustainability and quality compliance across the production cycle.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLION 2025 2024 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 1 372.8 1 319.3 +4.1% +8.9% +1.0% (5.8)% Adjusted Operating Profit 190.2 189.6 +0.3% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.9% 14.4% (52)bps (21)bps (5)bps (26)bpsThe Industry division achieved 8.9% organic growth in 2025  with 4.9% in the last quarter of the year. This performance was the result of robust market growth as strong investments in the energy sector continued and nations focused on the security of energy supply and driving energy transition programs.The Oil & Gas segment (32% of divisional revenue) delivered double-digit organic growth driven by high new projects  particularly in gas and in major resource-holding regions. Geographically  the Middle East  Africa and Asia have seen sustained investments. Opex activities posted more moderate organic growth  impacted by project delays.Power & Utilities (representing 15% of divisional revenue) maintained its strong double-digit growth in 2025. This performance was primarily driven by continued investments in renewables and nuclear as electricity demand continues its exponential growth on the back of data centers expansion and national electrification programs. Both Capex and Opex activities achieved double-digit increases  with a very strong performance in North America  Asia Pacific  and Middle Eastern markets. In the last quarter of 2025  the segment expanded its end-to-end Capex services through the acquisition of Sólida  a Spanish company providing services for wind and solar assets.Industrial Products Certification (17% of divisional revenue) services achieved high single-digit organic growth in 2025. This performance benefits from the segment’s strong leadership position in high-growth sectors  such as railway systems assessment  and from good traction in the traditional services of pressure vessel certification.In 2025  the Environmental Testing segment (10% of divisional revenue) delivered low single-digit organic growth. This performance is linked to the postponement of environmental campaigns as a result of delayed infrastructure and real estate developments due to high market uncertainties in North America.Finally  the Other industry-related services (26% of divisional revenue) posted a low single-digit organic growth from delayed projects procurement activity late in the year. Mining-related activities performed strongly supported by high investment levels in the current pricing upcycle of metals.The Industry division’s adjusted operating margin for the year decreased by 52 basis points to 13.9%. The minor organic decrease of 21 basis points reflects a seasonal mix effect.Transition services and Green objects highlightsThe Industry division continued to develop new capabilities to support the energy sector transition. In the Middle East  Bureau Veritas entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Masdar — an Abu Dhabi clean energy company — to collaboratively design a framework for renewables and green energy standards that address the specific requirements of investments and sustainability of the Gulf Cooperation Council region.

Recent acquisitions in line with LEAP I 28 plans are shifting the portfolio mix  and  in certain cases  they are already contributing meaningfully to organic growth.By segment  Buildings Capex (38% of divisional revenue) posted strong high single‑digit organic growth. The United States’ diversified platform led the growth through a sustained and accelerating momentum in services related to the commissioning of data center. This was fueled by several large hyperscalers’ projects in the US  Europe  and Asia  supported by the growth in cloud services and AI computing needs. Code compliance services maintained solid activity levels and services related to real‑estate transactions rebounded strongly  as commercial real estate activity resumes. In the rest of the world  France outperformed the market thanks to strong government activity and growing safety‑related services. In Asia  Japan’s strong growth benefited from the expansion of regulatory code compliance services to individual homes. Finally  in Latin America  the portfolio pivot continues as the business favors infrastructure and private sector construction projects over traditional public contracts.Buildings Opex services (42% of divisional revenue) achieved a low single-digit organic revenue increase in 2025. France contributed to growth through increased volumes  favorable pricing programs and ongoing demand for environmental measurement services and energy efficiency audits. In the United States  Opex activities focused on asset condition assessments for public sector clients in a few Western states. The Group expects a structural and sustained increase in demand for buildings sustainability‑related services  following refurbishements and programs addressing climate risks.The Infrastructure activity (20% of divisional revenue) was solid overall  up low to mid-single digit organically. In Europe  performance was supported by Italy’s continued government‑led infrastructure spending  with the Contec acquisition opening additional market opportunities. In North America  growth stemmed from several major programs  including rail upgrades  and bus terminals expansions in California. In Asia‑Pacific  all countries delivered double‑digit organic growth aside from China which remained soft but stable. In January 2026  the Group sold its non-core construction projects technical supervision business in China (EUR c.39 million in annualized revenue) in order to enhance its B&I business mix in the country. In the Middle East  strong growth continued  led by numerous megaprojects.2025 marked a strong year for portfolio expansion in Buildings & Infrastructure  with several European acquisitions. Integration efforts are ongoing  particularly with the APP Group  a leading Australian infrastructure player  starting to yield results with a robust pipeline of projects. The portfolio was further streamlined with the disposal of another infrastructure construction business based in China.Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved by a strong 81 basis points to 13.6% from 12.8% in the prior year.

Latin America started to reap the benefits of its recent investments.Softlines  Hardlines & Toys (47% of the divisional revenue) achieved low to mid-single digit organic growth in 2025. Early orders from US companies  prompted by tariffs concerns  led to an earlier peak season  mainly skewed to the first half of the year. In the second half  the acceleration in supply chain adjustments by western companies led to increased testing activities  particularly within the Softlines and Toys sub-segments  demonstrating greater flexibility in responding to these shifts.Healthcare (including Beauty and Household) (8% of divisional revenue) achieved high-single digit growth in 2025  with consistently strong performance from the Chinese operations throughout the year and a solid momentum in the US.Supply Chain & Sustainability services (15% of divisional revenue) recorded a double-digit organic performance in 2025  driven by high demand supply chain resilience services and social audits.

It was further supported by a positive scope effect of 15 basis points. This improvement was partially offset by foreign exchange.Transition services highlightsIn the fourth quarter of 2025  Transition Services continued to grow as the Group supported clients’ sustainability programs. Bureau Veritas secured a contract to deliver full decarbonization support for a leading sportswear brand  helping drive emissions‑reduction efforts across its Asian supplier base.

process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Company’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Company’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:Organic growth Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect) Impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Company internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Company’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Company to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Company’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Company also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Company level and for each business  based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:Constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period Constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:For acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year For acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated For disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Company For disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Company’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Company level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:Amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions Impairment of goodwill Impairment and retirement of non-current assets Restructuring costs Gains and losses on the disposal of activities  including in particular: Fees and acquisition costs of activities  including  when applicable  external costs related to their integration within the Company  Contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses  Gains and losses on the disposal of activities.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Company’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.Service costs rebilled to clients  that were previously included under the ""Purchases and external charges"" line item  are now presented separately  with no impact on operating profit and net profit in the current and previous year.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Company’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period (excluding own shares held by the Company).FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets Proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets Interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for changes in scope based on a 12-month period At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents loans and borrowings (bonds  bank loans  etc) plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Company represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Company represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined   and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 8 of this press release.2 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.3 Proposed dividend  subject to Shareholders’ Meeting approval on May 19  2026.4 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.5 Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated over a 12-month period from the beginning of Q4 2024 to end of Q3 2025.6 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).7 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).8 Number of learning hours per employee is calculated over a 12-month period.9 At constant currency.10 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.Attachment",positive,0.62,0.37,0.0,positive,0.78,0.22,0.0,True,English,"['new EUR 200 million share buyback', 'Sector-leading organic revenue growth', 'positive growth outlook', 'strong margin improvement', 'continued margin expansion', 'BUREAU VERITAS', 'FY', 'new EUR 200 million share buyback program', 'high single-digit organic revenue growth', 'Progressive LEAP I 28 strategy execution', 'enterprise risk assessment solutions', 'main consolidated financial items', 'sector leading organic growth', 'double‑digit shareholder returns', 'LEAP I 28 portfolio priorities', 'Sector-leading organic revenue growth', 'Strong cash flow generation', '2024 CHANGE CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue', 'New organization implementation', 'new organizational structure', 'outstanding share capital', 'higher energy investments', 'Consumer Product Services', 'sound market fundamentals', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'product lines’ services', 'M&A plans', 'Free Cash Flow', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'Double-digit shareholder returns', 'continued margin expansion', 'constant exchange rates', 'portfolio organic growth', 'EUR MILLION', 'strong margin expansion', 'superior, sustainable value', 'Attributable net profit', 'margin improvement plans', 'Positive growth outlook', 'Strong margin improvement', '6.3% organic growth', 'full year results', 'new strongholds', 'disciplined execution', 'Full-year revenue', 'annualized revenue', 'Strong drivers', 'strong 2025 performance', 'strong commitment', '2025 financial targets', 'financial statements', 'operating margin', 'operating profit', 'cash conversion', 'Portfolio refocusing', 'evolving portfolio', 'EPS growth', 'PRESS RELEASE', '2025 key figures1', 'ongoing buildup', 'operational leverage', 'functional scalability', 'two divestments', 'core areas', 'leadership positions', 'mature businesses', 'Bureau Veritas', 'financial ambition', 'Hinda Gharbi', 'solid progress', 'personal contributions', 'strategic plan', 'performance programs', 'regional platforms', 'cross‑selling', 'customer service', 'long term', 'Operating cash-flow', 'last year', 'second year', 'third year', 'passing year', 'tangible impact', 'Adjusted EPS', 'digital infrastructure', 'nine bolt', 'dividend yield', '2026 outlook', 'Courbevoie', 'France', 'February', 'FY', 'basis', '2.8% increase', 'December', '2025 highlights', 'clients', 'demand', 'corporate', 'acquisitions', 'Buildings', 'Power', 'Utilities', 'Renewables', 'Cybersecurity', 'Sustainability', 'Metals', 'Minerals', 'three', 'deals', 'c.', 'Group', 'colleagues', 'quality', 'effectiveness', 'stickiness', 'resilience', 'mid', 'Board', 'Directors']",2026-02-25,2026-02-26,globenewswire.com

ShareMEUDON  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb 25  2026--According to the Thales 2026 Data Threat Report  organizations across various markets including automotive  energy  finance and retail say the rapid pace of AI-driven transformation is now their biggest security challenge. Based on the report’s research  conducted by S&P Global 451 Research  61% cite AI as their top data security risk. The concern is not only about malicious AI  but about the access it is being granted as it shifts from a tool to a trusted insider.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260225599723/en/©ThalesAs enterprises embed AI into workflows  analytics  customer service  and development pipelines  these systems are being granted broad  automated access to enterprise data  often with fewer controls than those applied to human users in a corporate environment.“Insider risk is no longer just about people. It is also about automated systems that have been trusted too quickly ” says Sebastien Cano  Senior Vice President  Cybersecurity Products at Thales. “When identity governance  access policies  or encryption are weak  AI can amplify those weaknesses across corporate environments far faster than any human ever could.”Visibility Gaps Are Widening as AI Expands Data ReachThe report reveals a troubling disconnect between AI adoption and data control. Only 34% of organizations know where all their data resides  whatever the level of criticality  and just 39% can fully classify it. Meanwhile  nearly half (47%) of sensitive cloud data remains unencrypted.As AI systems ingest and act on data across cloud and SaaS environments  limited visibility makes enforcing least-privilege access increasingly difficult  that is granting only the strictly necessary access rights. This increases the extent of exposure if credentials are compromised.Identity infrastructure is now the primary attack surface. Credential theft remains the leading attack technique against cloud management infrastructure  cited by 67% of organizations experiencing cloud attacks. At the same time  50% rank secrets management among their top application security challenges  reflecting the growing complexity of governing machine identities  API (interfaces de programmation applicative) keys  and tokens at scale.AI Is Powering More Convincing AttacksWhile organizations race to adopt AI  attackers are doing the same. Nearly 60% of companies report experiencing deepfake-driven attacks  and 48% report reputational damage tied to AI-generated misinformation or impersonation campaigns.As AI introduces new risks  it also increases existing ones. Human error already contributes to 28% of breaches  and with automation layered on top  small mistakes can scale faster and spread wider.Security Investment Is Shifting  But Not at the Pace of the new RisksWhile organizations recognize the need to adapt  investment is not keeping pace with the rapid expansion of AI-driven access and automation. 30% now dedicate specific budgets to AI security  reflecting growing awareness. However  the majority (53%) still depend on traditional security programs built primarily for human users and perimeter-based controls. As machines increasingly authenticate  access  and act autonomously  many security strategies have yet to adjust to this shift in operating models.“As AI becomes deeply embedded into enterprise operations  continuous data visibility and protection are no longer optional ” said Eric Hanselman  Chief Analyst at S&P Global 451 Research. “Organizations must treat data security strategy as foundational to innovation  not separate from it.” iTrust Must Evolve as Machines Gain AccessAI is not replacing traditional threats; rather  it is intensifying them by increasing their speed  scale  and reach. As automated systems gain broader access to enterprise data  organizations must rethink identity  encryption  and data visibility as core infrastructure. The organizations that embed strong governance into their AI strategies will be better positioned to innovate securely and avoid turning AI into their newest insider threat.For more information  please download the full report and join our webinar hosted by Eric Hanselman  Chief Analyst at S&P Global 451 Research .About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies for the Defence  Aerospace  and Cyber & Digital sectors.
