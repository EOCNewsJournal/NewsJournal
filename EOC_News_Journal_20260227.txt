55154,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/633079-germany-russian-frozen-assets/,EU talk on further seizure of Russian assets ‘is closed’ – German FM,The EU will no longer consider using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine  German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said   Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc has failed to secure backing for a controversial plan to effectively steal Russia’s sovereign wealthGermany has ruled out seizing frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine  with Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying the issue is no longer on the EU agenda.Ukraine’s Western backers froze $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The majority is held at the Belgian-based Euroclear depository. Brussels has long opposed the idea of seizing the assets  with Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever saying such a move would amount to a “declaration of war” against Moscow.“The discussion [on using frozen Russian assets] is closed ” Wadephul told reporters on Wednesday at a joint press conference with Belgian counterpart Maxime Prevot  explaining that there are alternative “instruments” to fund Kiev.In December  the EU failed to agree on using the funds as collateral for a ‘reparations loan’ for Ukraine due to opposition from Belgium and other member states. Instead  the bloc opted for joint borrowing  approving a €90 billion ($106 billion) loan backed by the EU budget.Wadephul said the “loan path” was decided at EU level and Russian assets would be “addressed in the future.” He noted that while Hungary had agreed in December “via Prime Minister Orban ” its foreign minister was now blocking the agreement  and described Budapest’s veto as “a contradiction that has no explanation and is unacceptable.”Budapest last week imposed a veto on the loan for Ukraine in response to Kiev “blackmailing” Hungary and violating its obligations to the EU by halting oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline.Hungary and Ukraine remain locked in a bitter dispute over the Soviet-era conduit  which carries Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia and has been out of operation since late January. Kiev claims the pipeline was damaged by Russia  an allegation Moscow denies. Budapest  Bratislava  and Moscow accuse Kiev of deliberately halting supplies for political reasons.On Tuesday  Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky urged EU lawmakers to unlock the €90 billion loan package. Hungary has signaled it would only consider lifting its veto if Kiev resumes oil flows through the pipeline.Moscow has strongly opposed any seizure of its frozen assets  denouncing it as theft and warning of severe repercussions. In December  the Bank of Russia filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court seeking $232 billion in compensation for frozen assets and lost profits. The clearing house now faces more than 100 legal claims in Russian courts  according to reports,neutral,0.0,0.73,0.26,negative,0.0,0.21,0.79,True,English,"['EU talk', 'Russian assets', 'German FM', 'seizure', 'Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever', 'Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul', 'Prime Minister Orban', 'other member states', 'joint press conference', 'Belgian-based Euroclear depository', '€90 billion loan package', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'Belgian counterpart', 'frozen assets', 'sovereign wealth', 'joint borrowing', 'Russian oil', 'Russian courts', 'controversial plan', 'Western backers', 'Maxime Prevot', 'alternative “instruments', 'reparations loan', 'loan path', 'oil transit', 'bitter dispute', 'Soviet-era conduit', 'late January', 'political reasons', 'Vladimir Zelensky', 'oil flows', 'severe repercussions', 'clearing house', '100 legal claims', 'EU agenda', 'EU budget', 'EU level', 'EU lawmakers', 'Druzhba pipeline', 'Moscow court', 'Ukraine conflict', 'bloc', 'backing', 'Germany', 'issue', 'escalation', 'majority', 'Brussels', 'idea', 'move', 'declaration', 'war', 'discussion', 'reporters', 'Wednesday', 'Kiev', 'December', 'funds', 'collateral', 'opposition', 'Belgium', 'future', 'Hungary', 'agreement', 'Budapest', 'veto', 'contradiction', 'explanation', 'response', 'obligations', 'Slovakia', 'operation', 'allegation', 'Bratislava', 'supplies', 'Tuesday', 'seizure', 'theft', 'Bank', 'lawsuit', 'compensation', 'profits', 'reports']",2026-02-26,2026-02-27,rt.com

In the overall population  mean change from baseline in patients treated with VYVGART was a 4.04 point improvement in MGII PRO versus a mean change of 1.99 MGII PRO score in patients treated with placebo. Patients treated with VYVGART experienced a marked reduction of key ocular symptoms: diplopia (double vision) and ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelids).“Ocular myasthenia gravis significantly impacts patients’ daily lives  affecting vision  independence and the ability to do routine tasks  such as work or drive a car. Yet today  there are no approved targeted medicines for this disease ” said Carolina Barnett-Tapia  M.D.  Ph.D.  Associate Professor of Medicine (Neurology) at the University of Toronto. “The improvements observed with VYVGART in the OCULUS trial offer hope to the thousands of myasthenia gravis patients with ocular involvement.”VYVGART was well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile in patients with oMG  consistent with prior studies. No new safety concerns were identified.“ADAPT OCULUS is the first registrational study specifically designed to evaluate a targeted therapy for ocular myasthenia gravis ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Ocular MG has been historically under-studied and represents a significant unmet need in the MG community. These positive results deliver on our patient-centered approach to drug development and bring us one step closer to our vision of delivering a targeted  transformative treatment option to as many MG patients as possible and ensuring no patient is left behind.”Data from the ADAPT OCULUS study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.About the ADAPT OCULUS Study DesignADAPT OCULUS is a Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group design study evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART SC administered by prefilled syringe in adult patients with ocular MG (MGFA Class I) (n=141) across North America  Europe and Asia-Pacific. In Part A  randomized participants (1:1) received four once-weekly injections of efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo PH20 SC followed by a 4-week follow-up. In Part B  open-label extension  participants received 2 cycles of four once-weekly efgartigimod injections with a 4-week interval between cycles. Additional cycles from Cycle 3 onward could start ≥1 week after the last administration of the previous cycle  based on clinical status.The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index (MGII) (patient-reported outcome [PRO] subcomponent) ocular score at week 4 (day 29) compared to placebo in Part A. Enrolled participants were either seropositive or seronegative for AChR-Ab  and MGFA Class I with only ocular muscle weakness as determined by an MGII (PRO) ocular score of ≥6 with at least 2 ocular items with a score of ≥2. Participants were on a stable dose of gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs.MGII is a validated measure of disease severity based on the signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis and includes an ocular-specific subdomain that evaluates the two key clinical symptoms of oMG: diplopia and ptosis.Important Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.

VYVGART® Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa (VYVGART) and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. VYVGART is approved for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and immune thrombocytopenia (Japan only). VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for gMG and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). VYVGART Hytrulo may be marketed under different proprietary names in other regions.About Ocular Myasthenia Gravis (oMG)Ocular myasthenia gravis (oMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness limited to the muscles controlling the eyes and eyelids. Symptoms commonly include ptosis (drooping eyelids)  diplopia (double vision)  and fluctuating visual disturbance that can impair daily activities. Approximately 80% of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients initially present with ocular symptoms  and up to 92% experience ocular involvement at some point during the course of disease. While many progress to generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG)  in 15–25% of patients  weakness remains restricted to the ocular muscles. oMG is driven by pathogenic IgG autoantibodies that disrupt communication at the neuromuscular junction. Despite the functional and quality-of-life burden associated with persistent ocular symptoms  there are currently no approved targeted therapies specifically for oMG. Treatment approaches often rely on symptomatic therapies and generalized immunosuppression  underscoring the need for additional therapeutic options for this distinct MG population.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

In a challenging environment marked by political uncertainty  retail like-for-like growth and wholesale partners substantially contributed to performance  offsetting the impact of our network optimisation plan and foreign exchange headwinds. Our action plan is delivering as expected  with a strong improvement of profitability  bringing us back to positive net income. We have also maintained strict financial discipline  resulting in record cash generation and continued deleveraging. Building on these results and in a challenging market environment  we reiterate our 2026 guidance for EBIT margin improvement and solid free cash-flow generation.”FINANCIAL INDICATORS€m FY2024 FY2025 Reportedchange Sales 1 211.7 1 217.4 +0.5% Adjusted EBITDA 216.4 231.3 +7% Adjusted EBIT 53.0 95.2 +80% Net Income -23.6 16.6 - FCF 48.9 91.1 +86% Net Debt 237.2 147.5 -38%SALES€m Q42024 Q42025 Organicchange Reportedchange FY2024 FY2025 Organicchange Reportedchange Sales by region France 117.5 107.3 -8.7% -8.7% 417.8 411.4 -1.6% -1.6% EMEA ex.

After a positive first half (+2.3%)  the second half was impacted by a political and social environment that was less supportive of consumer demand  particularly in Q4. However  the execution of our full‑price strategy continues to support sales quality and profitability.The closure of corners at BHV in Paris and at SGM in the regions (Limoges  Dijon  Grenoble  Reims and Angers) weighed on Q4 sales and reduced the store network (-25 points of sale). These closures  combined with the continued optimisation of the Claudie Pierlot and Fursac networks  largely explain the decrease in the number of points of sale  with 49 net closures in 2025.In the EMEA region  sales reached €430 million  up 6.8% organically compared to 2024  driven mainly by like‑for‑like growth (+5.4%)  which was positive in almost all directly operated markets  supported by high‑quality traffic and the full‑price strategy. This trend confirms the strength of demand for the Group’s brands and their continued attractiveness. In addition  partner activity maintained strong momentum  particularly in the Middle East and Turkey.Over the year  the region recorded 29 net store openings  mostly through partnerships  both through entry into new markets (Balkans  Georgia and Jordan)  and the continued expansion in existing markets (Turkey and the Middle East).In America  sales amounted to €193 million  up 10.1% organically compared to 2024  despite a high comparison base. Like‑for‑like sales increased in both the United States and Canada  despite a challenging environment. In the second half  the strict full‑price strategy resulted in a two‑point reduction in the average discount rate  further strengthening brand desirability. Growth remained particularly strong in Mexico.The Group recorded a few adjustments within its retail network (Hudson’s Bay store closures and Holt Renfrew openings in Canada). Among the countries operated by partners  the opening of two new markets (Argentina and Chile) offset several closures in Mexico.In APAC  sales reached €183 million  down 8.8% organically compared to 2024  reflecting the anticipated full‑year impact of network optimisation in China (65 net store closures in 2024) as well as the sharp reduction in the discount rate initiated in 2025 (-5 points)  aimed at strengthening brand desirability.The stabilisation of like‑for‑like sales in brick‑and‑mortar stores in China confirms the relevance of the strategic plan currently being implemented. Digital sales  meanwhile  were impacted by the strict full‑price strategy.In the rest of the region  sales remained resilient  with a positive trend notably in Vietnam  Malaysia and Thailand.The regional store network recorded four openings during the year; the continued rationalisation of the network in China (seven net closures) was more than offset by network expansion through partners  including entry into new countries such as India and the Philippines  as well as further development in existing markets.2025 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reached €231m in 2025 (Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  and increases compared to 2024 (€216m i.e. 18% of sales).Management gross margin ratio (75.0%) gaining 0.7 points in 2025  supported by a strict full-price strategy.Total Opex (store costs4F4F3 and general and administrative expenses) slightly decreased compared to 2024  in line with our cost optimisation plan.Depreciation and amortisation amounted to -€136m in 2025  decreasing vs 2024 (-€163m). As a reminder  2024 included accelerated depreciation charges related to the network optimisation plan. Excluding IFRS 16  they represent 3.2% of sales in 2025 (4.2% in 2024).Adjusted EBIT reached €95m in 2025  progressing by +80% compared to 2024 (€53m). Adjusted EBIT margin at 7.8% in 2025  increasing by 3.4 points during the year (4.4% in 2024). The margin also improved between H1 (7.1%) and H2 (8.5%).Other non-current expenses reached -€31m  slightly decreasing compared to 2024 (-€35m); they include stores and goodwill impairment  with no effect on cash.Financial expenses reached -€30m in 2025 vs -€32M in 2024 (including -€15m of interests on rental debt vs -€12m in 2024). Interest expenses on financial debt decreased (-€13m in 2025 vs -€18m in 2024)  due to a combination of lower debt and decrease in market interest rates and spreads.Taking into account an income tax of -€14m in 2025 (-€7m in 2024)  Net income - Group share stands at €17m  strongly improving vs 2024 (-€24m).2025 BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments during the year. Inventories went down from €260m at year-end 2024 to €233m at year-end 2025.Capex investments went down from €39m in 2024 to €28m in 2025.Net financial debt decreased by 38% in one year  and landed at €148m as of December 31st  2025  vs €237m a year earlier. Net debt/EBITDA ratio stands at 1.3x  halved in one year (2.6x in 2024).PERSPECTIVESSince 2024  the Group has been implementing a medium‑term action plan aimed at restoring profitable growth momentum  structured around four pillars:reignite growth and gain market share;leverage its balanced  diversified global geographic footprint;increase agility and harness the latest innovations to enhance efficiency and profitability;maintain disciplined management in support of higher profitability and a solid financial structure.In 2025  this plan delivered tangible results  and the Group enters fiscal year 2026 with reinforced execution discipline.Against an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop  marked by challenging consumer conditions in the early weeks of the year  SMCP intends to continue rolling out its strategic roadmap  aims to further improve profitability  and confirms its 2026 guidance:• an adjusted EBIT margin increasing compared to 2025  reaching c.10% of sales in H2 • free cash-flow generation of €50 million for the year (excluding exceptional costs related to a potential capital transaction at SMCP). This level  which is more normalised in 2026 after an exceptional year in 2025  will support the Group’s continued deleveraging.OTHER INFORMATIONConsolidated accounts approvementThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for 2025. The limited review procedures have been completed by the auditors and the related report is being issued.FINANCIAL CALENDARApril 28 th  2026 – Q1 Sales publicationJune 11th  2026 – Annual Shareholding MeetingJuly 28th  2026 – H1 Results publicationA conference call and a webcast with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time). Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyse the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic revenue growth represents total sales for a given period compared with the same period of the prior year  at constant exchange rates (with sales in foreign currencies for both periods translated at the average exchange rate of the prior year) and excluding scope effects.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Women to Sandro Men or to a mixed Sandro Women and Sandro Men store).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP. Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs.Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest. It corresponds to current and non-current financial debt  net of cash and cash equivalents and net of current bank overdrafts.METHODOLOGY NOTEUnless otherwise indicated  amounts are expressed in millions of euros and rounded to the first digit after the decimal point.

These impacts mainly consist of market rents associated with real-estate assets held  as defined in the Cushman & Wakefield report on the valuation of the Group's real-estate portfolio  as well as operating costs associated with real-estate holdings (calculated on the basis of the Group's property operating costs).* With a comparable balance sheet structureSophie Boissard  Chief Executive Officer of the Clariane Group  said:In 2025  we finalised the plan to strengthen our financial position  which was launched in November 2023  six months ahead of schedule. This success enabled us  in line with our objectives  to reduce our level of financial leverage and regain normal access to the debt market  particularly the bond market.In France  after a 2024 financial year and first half of 2025  which were penalised by the entry into force of the new financing framework for medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities  marked by  on the one hand  ‘tariff anomalies’ and implementation delays and  on the other hand  the underfunding of newly opened facilities  the measures taken by the Group and the corrections agreed by the authorities supported the recovery in operating performance during the second half of the year  a recovery which full effects will materialise as of 2026.At the same time  and in line with its mission  the Group remained more focused than ever on strengthening its fundamentals and preparing for the future  particularly in terms of care and support for all vulnerabilities  with non-financial indicators once again demonstrating the remarkable commitment of all teams: the Net Promoter Score and the number of employees enrolled in training programmes in 2025 exceeded the ambitious targets we had set ourselves  and the frequency of workplace accidents continued to decline.On this basis  and thanks to the impact of the “Better support” operational excellence programme  Clariane has everything it needs to approach the coming financial years with confidence and consolidate its position as a leading European player in the prevention and management of frailty and age-related conditions.DisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase or subscribe for bonds in any country  particularly in the United States.

The difference between reported and organic performance is due to the impact of disposals in 2024 and 2025 as part of the plan to strengthen the Group's financial position  restated for real-estate revenue and the revision of expected income from the reform of healthcare activities in France.This momentum confirms the Group's solidity  which is underpinned by the quality of its diversified portfolio  both in terms of activities and geographies.Over the whole of the 2025 financial year  the occupancy rate in retirement homes reached 91.0%  compared with 90.6% in 2024. It should be noted that the average occupancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2025 was 91.6%  compared with 91.0% for the same period in 2024.The network operated as at 31 December 2025  all activities combined  now comprises 1 215 facilities  compared with 1 219 as at 31 December 2024  for a total of nearly 89 400 beds  compared with 90 500 in 2024. These changes take into account:Disposals carried out as part of the plan to strengthen the Group's financial position (France  Italy and Germany);And finally  the closures and restructuring of facilities in France  Germany  Spain and Belgium.These operations were partially offset by:The opening of new Ages & Vie shared homes in France;The commissioning and opening of new facilities in Spain  Belgium  the Netherlands and Germany;In total  between December 2024 and December 2025  the Group sold or closed 34 facilities  while at the same time opening 30 new facilities.The growth in revenue resulted from:A 1.4% increase in volumes   representing a net increase of €74 million (growth in the number of days billed and the commissioning of additional capacity);  representing a net increase of (growth in the number of days billed and the commissioning of additional capacity); A positive pricing impact of +3.1% or +€156 million across all regions  particularly in France  Germany and Belgium-Netherlands  offsetting a slight decline in France in the Specialty Care business due to the impact of the medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities reform;of or across all regions  particularly in France  Germany and Belgium-Netherlands  offsetting a slight decline in France in the Specialty Care business due to the impact of the medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities reform; A negative scope impact of -3.1% to -€160m mainly due to the disposal plan;of to mainly due to the disposal plan; A negative impact from various and transitional items of -0.9% to -€42 million  related in particular to pricing anomalies accompanying the entry into force in 2024 of the reform of medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities (-€23 million) and the suspension of real-estate development activities  particularly within the Ages & Vie business segment (-€18 million) in France.1.1.2 - Analysis of pre-IFRS 16 EBITDAR  pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA and opco EBITDAIn millions of euros – 2024 Reported 2024Pro forma disposals 2025 Changes Reported Pro forma EBITDAR pre-IFRS 16 1 154 1 120 1 159 +0.4% +3.5% EBITDA pre-IFRS 16 605 576 594 -1.8% +3.1% Impact of IAS 17Real-estate developmentAmount of internal rentsHolding costs -69-10-171+10 -69-10-169+10 -70-15-169+10EBITDA Opco (1) 366 338 351 -4.0% +3.9%(1) Opco EBITDA is defined as follows: EBITDA (1) after capitalised leases in accordance with IFRS 16 (including leases already capitalised prior to the application of IFRS 16  under IAS 17) and (2) restated for the impact of the Group's real-estate holdings. These impacts mainly consist of market rents associated with real-estate assets held  as defined in the Cushman & Wakefield report on the valuation of the Group's real-estate portfolio  as well as operating costs associated with real-estate holdings (calculated on the basis of the Group's property operating costs).EBITDAR pre-IFRS 16 amounted to €1 159m in 2025  up +3.5% on a pro forma basis excluding disposals.Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA amounted to €594m for the period  up +3.1% on a pro forma basis excluding disposals. This pro forma increase in pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA reflects the improvement in the margin recorded in the second half of the year  which stood at 12.5% compared with 9.9% in the first half of 2025 and 11.9% in the second half of 2024  supported by good control of operating costs  active case mix management and the gradual adaptation of the organisation to the new pricing framework  which  together with the correction of certain regulatory pricing anomalies  started to offset the negative impact of the reform of healthcare pricing in France over this period. On a pro forma basis  the EBITDA margin remained stable at 11.2%.The change in pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA is the result of:The impact of changes in scope (-€29m) related to the divestment plan  and closures of a few underperforming facilities in France  Germany and Italy;An upward adjustment in prices and tariffs (net impact of +€3m  with a positive effect linked to tariff increases of +€156m offsetting cost inflation of -€153m);A volume effect of +€17 million.Opco EBITDA amounted to €351m  up +3.9% on a pro forma basis excluding disposals and down -4.0% on a reported basis. This Opco EBITDA measures the profitability of operations  net of all rents (including on real-estate assets owned by the group) and costs related to the group's ownership of part of its real-estate portfolio under management. This growth reflects the improvement in the company's operational performance across its various business lines. and good control of rents in relative terms  which remained stable in absolute terms.1.1.3 - Net profitOver the year as a whole  the Group's net profit  pre-IFRS 16  showed a positive result of €36 million  compared with a loss of €20 million in 2024.The change is essentially explained by:A decrease in non-recurring expenses  which amounted to €0 million in 2025 (compared to-€38 million in 2024)  including -€70 million in reorganisation and restructuring costs -€102 million in asset impairments (with no impact on cash flow) in France  Germany and Italy  and +€185 million in net proceeds from disposals;-€38 million in 2024)  including -€70 million in reorganisation and restructuring costs  -€102 million in asset impairments (with no impact on cash flow) in France  Germany and Italy  and +€185 million in net proceeds from disposals; An improvement in the financial result of -€186 million in 2025  compared to -€195 million in 2024  linked to the decrease in debt over one year  and despite a slight increase in the average cost of debt;Tax income of +€3m in 2025  stable compared to 2024A slight increase in minority interests  amounting to -€8 million in 2025 compared to -€3 million in 2024;Profit from continuing operations stands at €36 million in 2025 compared to €5 million in 2024.Net profit attributable to the Group  post-IFRS 16  shows a profit of €2 million in 2025  compared with a loss of €55 million in 2024.The Group notes that the terms of the amendment and extension agreement to the syndicated loan signed on 14 February 2025 limit dividend distributions to 40%  provided that leverage is less than 4x at the end of the financial year. In this context  the Group will not pay a dividend for the 2025 financial year.1.2 - Cash flowIn millions of euros  and pre-IFRS 16 2024 2025 EBITDA 605 594 Operating cash flow 400 469 Taxes and financial expenses -217 -202 Free operating cash flow 183 267 Development investments -131 -101 Financial investments (acquisitions/disposals) 286 318 Net free cash flow 338 483 Dividend payments (coupons) -16 -37 Net real-estate investments/divestments -6 -8 Capital increase 307 -4 Real-estate partnerships -134 -33 Other (including changes in scope) -40 6 Cash flow from discontinued operations -13 - Change in net debt (incl. IAS17) 435 408Net debt shows a decrease of €408m as at 31 December 2025 (including IAS 17). Excluding IAS 17  the decrease in net debt amounts to €390m.This decrease in net debt is mainly due to:Operating cash flow of €469 million in 2025  compared with €400 million in 2024  supported by a significant improvement in working capital requirements (+€99 million) and broadly stable maintenance investments (€111 million  compared with €105 million in 2024);Financial expenses and taxes paid of -€202 million in 2025 Investments limited to -€159 million in 2025  compared to -€242 million in 2024;Coupon payments of -€37 million;Cash flows related to real-estate partnerships of -€33 million in 2025;And finally  proceeds from disposals of +€368 million  reflecting the completion of the disposal plan.2 - Real-estate portfolioThe value of the Group's real-estate portfolio stood at €2 459 million at 31 December 2025  compared with €2 612 million and €2 456 million on a pro forma basis excluding disposals at 31 December 2024.This change is due to disposals made during the financial year. On a like-for-like basis  values are stable. The average capitalisation rate in 2025 is 6.5%  which is stable compared to 31 December 2024.This change has no significant impact on the valuation of assets in the Group's accounts  which are recorded at historical cost.Real-estate debt fell to €1 423m at 31 December 2025  compared with €1 489m at 31 December 2024  after restatement of Ages&Vie real-estate receivables. With a real-estate portfolio value of €2 459m at 31 December 2025  the Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio stands at 58% on that date  compared with 57% at 31 December 2024.The value of the Group's real-estate holdings  net of minority interests in real-estate partnerships and real-estate debt  stood at €471m at the end of December 2025.3 - Balance sheet situationThe Group's net financial debt  excluding IFRS 16 and IAS 17  amounted to €3 055m as at 31 December 2025  compared with €3 445m as at 31 December 2024  representing a decrease in net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 and IAS 17) of €390m.Net financial debt consists of:Gross borrowings and financial debt before IFRS 16 of €3 839m at 31 December 2025  compared with €3 963m at 31 December 2024  excluding IAS 17 debt  which amounted to €508 million at 31 December 2025  compared with €526 million at 31 December 2024;at 31 December 2025  compared with €3 963m at 31 December 2024  excluding IAS 17 debt  which amounted to €508 million at 31 December 2025  compared with €526 million at 31 December 2024; Cash and cash equivalents stood at €785 million at 31 December 2025  compared with €518 million at 31 December 2024. As a reminder  the Group also has an undrawn RCF facility of €402 million  bringing the Group's total liquidity to €1 187 million.The Group's Wholeco financial leverage ratio  as defined in the syndicated credit extension agreement announced on 17 February 2025  stands at 5.1x as at 31 December 2025  compared with 5.8x as at 31 December 2024. Opco leverage  as defined in its bank financing agreements  stood at 3.1x as at 31 December 2025  compared with 3.8x as at 31 December 2024.4 - Finalisation of the 2024-2025 Plan to strengthen the financial positionThis plan  announced on 14 November 2023  involving a total amount of €1.5 billion  aimed to secure and accelerate Clariane's debt reduction trajectory and enable the Group to adapt its financial position to an economic environment made more difficult by the level of inflation  rising interest rates and tightening credit and real-estate markets  and finally to give it room for manoeuvre in the execution of its strategy.With the successful completion on 5 July 2024 of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights  which followed the reserved capital increase carried out on 12 June 2024  the first three components of this plan were finalised eight months after its launch.The fourth and final phase of this plan  consisting of a programme of disposals of operating and real-estate assets and equity partnerships aimed in particular at refocusing its activities geographically  with expected gross proceeds of approximately €1 billion  was completed in the first half of 2025  six months ahead of the initial schedule based on a valuation ratio of around 14x EBITDA  while enabling the Group to refocus on its core businesses and geographies.Net capital gains associated with the asset disposal programme amounted to €185 million in 2025.In line with expectations  the completion of this plan has fully contributed to the Group's debt reduction objectives  improved its Wholeco financial leverage and restored normal access to the debt market.5 - CSR performanceAs part of the non-financial objectives and indicators defined in the 2024-2026 CSR roadmap  which underpin its corporate mission commitments  Clariane exceeded most of its 2025 non-financial objectives:Key indicators and targets in the 2024-2026 roadmap(Audit procedures completed.

By the end of 2025  while maintaining a certification rate of 98.7% for retirement homes and specialised clinics  93% of the entities involved in this process within other activities  such as shared housing  had obtained external certification.  Clariane launched a certification process covering all of its activities in 2024. By the end of 2025  while maintaining a certification rate of 98.7% for retirement homes and specialised clinics  93% of the entities involved in this process within other activities  such as shared housing  had obtained external certification. Clariane obtained Top Employer 2026 certification2   both at European level and in each of the six countries where it operates: Clariane thus consolidated its status as the first player in the sector to obtain this distinction at European level  with scores improving across all its locations. This certification recognises the Clariane Group's commitment to developing the skills of its employees  ensuring high-quality working conditions and promoting social dialogue. For example:In terms of skills development : within the Clariane University  which brings together all the training courses related to the Group's activities  7 743 employees are enrolled in a qualifying course at the end of 2025. The vast majority of these courses relate to care professions  illustrating Clariane's commitment to providing long-term support for chronic illnesses and dependency. In addition  in order to strengthen the consideration and support essential to the teams  a new programme was launched in 2025 for regional directors  ""OLM"" (Operational Leadership Masterclass)  with the aim of strengthening operational leadership. In addition  55 facility directors obtained MEOS certification in 2025  contributing to the achievement of internal promotion objectives. In terms of health and safety   the frequency rate of lost-time accidents stood at 28 in 2025  confirming the decline observed in previous financial years (-9 points since 2023). In light of this key challenge  this result illustrates the impetus given at Group level and within facilities to better analyse the causes of workplace accidents and define appropriate preventive measures. These initiatives are part of a rich social dialogue: in line with the European Health and Safety Protocol (2021)  Clariane concluded an innovative tripartite health and safety agreement with the European Works Council (EWC) and EPSU in June 2025. Based on a concerted approach  the provisions of this agreement include targeted equipment and training aimed at preventing occupational risks  in line with the objective of reducing the frequency of workplace accidents. Senior management and the social partners are thus committed to continuing to reduce absenteeism (which stood at 10.6% at the end of 2025  compared with 10.4% in 2024). In 2025  Clariane maintained its commitment to promoting diversity   with 51% of women in top management and 44% on Group or country management committees  exceeding the 2025 targets. Finally  an employee share ownership plan   "" Ensemble ""   offering the same number of share allocation rights (50)  was launched for the benefit of all Group employees in October 2025.In terms of reducing its carbon footprint3   Clariane will achieve a performance in line with its 2031 decarbonisation trajectory as validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) by the end of 2025. This demanding trajectory is based in particular on the adaptation of equipment and practices and the gradual implementation of automated management tools.The company notes that the Mission Committee will prepare its third report to assess the consistency of the actions taken in relation to the five commitments of the mission.6 - Recent events6.1 - Reorganisation of Clariane's activitiesTo address the public health challenges associated with an ageing population and the increase in chronic diseases  Clariane has developed diversified and complementary forms of support and care in its various geographical areas  which will in future be organised around the following two activities:""Long term care""  which includes the segments ""Medicalized nursing homes"" and ""Alternative living solutions"";“Speciality care”  which includes the “Specialty and post-acute” and “Mental health” segments.On this basis  the table below reflects the Group's performance on a historical basis and on the basis of the new segmentation of the Group's activities:Historical segmentationIn millions of euros – 2024 revenue Revenue 2025 % of revenue Variations Reported Organic Long-term Care 3 281 3 387 64% +3.2% +4.8% Specialised healthcare establishments and services 1 346 1 287 24% -4.4% +1.8% Community Care and shared accommodation 655 636 12% -2.8% +8.7% Total 5 282 5 310 100% +0.5% +4.5%New segmentationIn millions of euros – Revenue 2024 Revenue 2025 % of revenue Variations Reported Organic Long term careMedicalized nursing homesAlternative living solutions 3 9363 281655 4 0233 387636 76% +2.2% +5.4% Specialty careSpecialty & post-acuteMental health 1 346961385 1 287906381 24% -4.4% +1.8% Total 5 282 5 310 100% +0.5% +4.5%6.2 - Plan to adapt the Group's central functions in GermanyIn spring 2025  Korian Germany launched a programme to reduce non-refinanced payroll costs  resulting in the elimination of 111 positions within central functions (head office) and 69 positions within the network.The project was presented to the social partners on 3 July 2025. Negotiations on the social plan took place in parallel for seven legal entities. The agreement was signed at the end of October 2025.In central functions  redundancies were implemented in two stages:A first phase in November 2025  with contracts ending between the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026;A second phase with contract terminations set for 31 March 2026.The effects of these measures measures contributed in part to the improvement in the Group's results in Germany at the end of 2025. Their full effect should be felt in 2026.6.3 - Employment Protection Plan in FranceAt the end of 2023  Clariane launched a plan to strengthen its financial position with the aim of reducing its debt and restoring its self-financing capacity on a sustainable basis. This plan  finalised in July 2025  resulted in the sale of assets worth approximately €1 billion. In addition  the sector underwent a profound transformation of its economic model  marked in particular by the reform of the financing of medical  post-acute and rehabilitation activities and mental health activities in France.These changes  combined with the roll-out of the programme to digitise and automate certain transactional functions (Platform 2.0 programme)  made it essential to reorganise support functions to maintain an effective level of support consistent with the new network structure.In this context  on 3 February 2026  the Group presented its social partners with a draft Employment Protection Plan (PSE)  including an initial voluntary redundancy phase  exclusively within support functions in France. This plan provides for a net reduction of 71 jobs.This plan does not affect the Group's operational activities in France  namely Korian Long-term Care  Inicea clinics and Âges & Vie shared accommodation.The impact of this plan will be felt gradually during the 2026 financial year and in full from 2027 onwards.6.4 - Inaugural corporate ratingsOn 25 February 2026  S&P Global Ratings assigned the following ratings:Corporate rating of B+/Stable to Clariane SE ;;

This strong year-on-year improvement of c. +220 basis points mainly came from the translation of revenue growth into profit  the structurally positive scalability and mix effects of the Group activities. It was also the result of further operational efficiencies resulting notably from the deployment of AI tools and strict financial discipline.Operating profit reached € 60.8 million in FY 2025  up +31.7% compared to FY 2024 that was impacted by IPO costs and Profit for the period amounted to € 50.0 million  up +17.0% year-on-year.Cash generation was strong in FY 2025  with adjusted FCF* reaching € 59.3 million (+8.7% year-on-year)  representing a Cash Conversion Rate* of 80.1%  in line with the c. 80% annual objective.

We continued to execute our strategic roadmap  expanding geographically  accelerating innovation  and maintaining strict financial discipline. This translated into market share gains  resilient double-digit revenue growth in constant currencies  significant profitability improvement  and robust cash generation.After several quarters marked by limited visibility  elongated customer decision cycles  and IT budget pressure  market conditions improved toward year-end resulting in renewed commercial momentum and a strong level of signings. This shift reinforces our confidence to progressively reaccelerate revenue growth toward our historical mid-to-high teens levels  over the mid-term.With a solid financial profile and a clear competitive edge  we are continuing to invest in R&D and geographical expansion to deliver increasing value to our customers. AI is a central pillar of this strategy  enhancing customer outcomes and internal productivity through easier access  broader decision support capabilities  and faster product delivery on our unified platform. As agent usage expands  our business model becomes even more resilient thanks to required seat-based access supporting confidentiality and security  while token costs remain minimal and hybrid workflows continue to support advanced  data intensive use cases.While the global environment remains particularly uncertain  especially with US dynamics very difficult to anticipate  we enter 2026 with confidence  supported by the strong recent commercial momentum and our solid commercial pipeline. We then believe these dynamics  including accelerating innovation cycles and strengthened commercial traction  would translate into stronger revenue growth as early as this year  combined with high profitability and cash generation.”FY 2025 revenue by revenue streamIn € million FY 2025 FY 2024 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 179.7 162.7 +10.4% +12.8% SaaS & Hosting 93.7 82.0 +14.2% +16.7% Annual licenses 1.7 1.1 +63.4% +69.0% Evolutive support 53.6 48.7 +10.0% +12.5% Subscription support 11.7 11.9 -1.6% +1.6% Maintenance 19.0 19.1 -0.3% +1.1% Non-recurring revenue 18.3 20.7 -11.6% -10.1% Perpetual licenses 5.8 7.5 -22.7% -21.3% Implementation & others non-recurring 12.5 13.3 -5.3% -3.7% Total revenue 198.0 183.4 +7.9% +10.3%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at FY 2024 average exchange rates.Reaching € 198.0 million in FY 2025  revenue was up +7.9% in current currencies and +10.3% in constant currencies.

In 2025  capitalized development costs amounted to € 3.1 million  +23.4% compared to € 2.5 million in 2024.Reaching € 35.4 million in 2025  Sales & marketing expenses increased by +6.1% compared to 2024  led in particular by the increase in employee-related costs in the salesforce and marketing team. Sales & marketing expenses represented 17.9% of 2025 revenue  -30 basis points compared to 18.2% in 2024  and are expected to increase in the future as Planisware plans on strengthening its leading market position.Representing 14.0% of revenue in 2025  (-20 basis points year-on-year)  General & administrative expenses reached € 27.6 million (including € 0.9 million of foreign exchanges losses vs. € 0.2 million gains in 2024). Adjusted for this foreign exchange gains and losses  General & administrative expenses presented a -70 basis points year-on-year decrease compared to revenue.

It represented 37.4% of 2025 revenue  c. +220 basis points compared to 35.2% in 2024. The increase of adjusted EBITDA reflects the revenue growth  a positive mix effect  and further efficiency gains on employee-related costs  in particular on R&D spending benefitting from increased usage of AI tools.Profit for the period and dividendReaching € 0.1 million in 2025  financial income significantly decreased compared to € 5.4 million in 2024. This amount was primarily driven by interest income from time deposits and marketable securities (€+2.7 million vs. €+3.9 million in 2024)  unrealized gains on marketable securities (€+1.2 million vs. € 0.0 million in 2024)  as well as foreign exchange unrealized losses arising from the revaluation at closing rates of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies (€-3.2 million vs. €+1.7 million in 2024)  and interest expense accounted on lease liabilities (€-0.4 million vs. €-0.3 million in 2024).Income tax expense amounted to € 10.9 million in 2025  up +24.2% compared to € 8.8 million in 2024  reflecting an Effective Tax rate of 17.9% compared to 17.0% in 2024 which benefited from a one-off tax credit related to the capital increase reserved for employees concurrently to the IPO.As a result of these evolutions  profit for the period reached € 50.0 million in 2025  up +17.0% (€+7.3 million) compared to 2024. It represents € 0.71 earnings per share.Finally  subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of the Company’s shareholders and effective approbation of 2025 consolidated financial statements by the Board of directors  and in line with its historical dividend distribution  the Group will pay a dividend representing 50% of its profit for the period. This would represent € 25.2 million or € 0.36 per share (+16.1% year-on-year).Cash generation and net cash positionReflecting the growth of subscription contracts billed in advance of the services rendered  change in working capital was €+2.5 million  stable year-on-year. Capital expenditures totaled € 6.1 million  representing 3.1% of revenue  compared to € 5.5 million in 2024 (3.0% of revenue)  in line with the usual c. 3% level targeted. Tax paid in 2025 was € 12.1 million compared to € 8.4 million in 2024  related to higher 2025 Income Tax prepayments in France.As a result  Cash Conversion Rate* reached 80.1%  in line with the 80% level that the Group considers being the normative Cash Conversion Rate for the coming years  and adjusted Free Cash Flow* totaled € 59.3 million  +8.7% compared to € 54.6 million in 2024.Finally  in 2025  Planisware paid € 21.8 million and € 10.0 million for dividend and share buyback  respectively.As of December 31  2025  except for lease liabilities related to offices and datacenter facilities which amounted to € 17.6 million (€ 17.0 million as of December 31  2024) and small amounts of bank overdrafts  Planisware did not have any financial debt. As a result  the Group’s net cash position* as of December 31  2025 amounted to € 195.6 million  compared to € 176.1 million as of December 31  2024.Headcount evolutionTotal number of employees by region 30.06.24 31.12.24 30.06.25 31.12.25 Europe 395 403 429 458 North America 167 174 183 184 APAC & ROW 152 171 188 196 Total 714 748 800 838Total headcount grew by +12.0% (+90 employees) over 2025  of which +4.8% (+38 employees) over the second half of the year.Hiring efforts mostly targeted Europe  where is located the R&D team and significant part of Management  Administration and Marketing teams with headcount net growth by +13.6% (+55 employees) in 2025 and  to a lesser extent  APAC & ROW  by +14.6% (+25 employees) to staff the strong bookings recorded from Singapore and in the Middle East.By function  besides support teams where most of the 2025 hirings were done in order to serve the newly signed customers  hiring effort also concerned the Sales & Marketing team with headcount net growth by +15.8% (+21 employees) as part of Planisware’s growth strategy.2026 objectivesDespite a global environment that remains volatile and uncertain  Planisware enters 2026 with confidence and disciplined ambition  supported by its strong recent commercial momentum and its solid commercial pipeline.

While this approach effectively captured upsell and cross‑sell within the Group’s long‑standing customer base  it did not fully reflect the revenue impact of customer churn or down‑sell.Under the new methodology  NRR calculation is based on all customers that contributed to recurring revenue 12 months prior. This includes renewals  upsells  cross‑sells  down‑sells  and churn. Revenue from new customers (i.e.  those acquired within the past 12 months) continues to be excluded. A customer is considered as a new customer during the first 12 months they generate recurring revenue.It is then calculated as the recurring revenue of a given 12-month period generated by customers having contributed to recurring revenue of the prior 12-month period  divided by the total recurring revenue in the prior 12-month period  in constant currencies.This adjustment of Planisware’s NRR calculation methodology provides a more accurate representation of the revenue dynamics within Planisware’s customer base over time  incorporating both expansion and contraction. The adjusted methodology presents a more conservative and holistic view of the Group’s customer revenue trajectory.Churn rateChurn rate aims to measure lost recurring revenue in a given 12-month period.Historically  Planisware strictly focused on terminating customers during the measured year and relied on a fixed “start‑of‑year” cohort. Under this previous methodology  churn rate was calculated as the Year N‑1 recurring revenue generated by customers who terminated during Year N  divided by the Year N recurring revenue generated by customers active at the beginning of Year N.Under the updated methodology  churn rate is calculated as the prior 12-month period recurring revenue from customers which did not contribute to recurring revenue in the given 12-month period  divided by the recurring revenue from all customers in the prior 12-month period. This creates a rolling 12‑month cohort aligned with the Group’ Net Retention Rate methodology.Effects of the calculation methodology adjustmentsIn € million FY 2025 FY 2024 Net Retention Rate Adjusted methodology +110% +117% Former methodology +112% +121% Churn rate Adjusted methodology +1.4% +2.0% Former methodology +1.7% +2.2%Investors & Analysts conference callPlanisware’s management team will host an international conference call on February 26  2025 at 8:00am CET to detail FY 2025 performance and key achievements  as well as FY 2026 perspectives  by means of a presentation followed by a Q&A session.

Non-IFRS financial information may exclude certain items contained in the nearest IFRS financial measure or include certain non-IFRS components. Readers should not consider items which are not recognized measurements under IFRS as alternatives to the applicable measurements under IFRS. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and readers should not treat them as substitutes for IFRS measures. In particular  readers should not consider such measurements of the Group’s financial performance or liquidity as an alternative to profit for the period  operating income or other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from (used in) operating activities as a measurement of the Group’s liquidity. Other companies with activities similar to or different from those of the Group could calculate non-IFRS measures differently from the calculations adopted by the Group.Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined as follows:Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Current operating profit including share of profit of equity-accounted investees  plus amortization and depreciation as well as impairment of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  plus either non-recurring items or non-operating items.Adjusted EBITDA margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenue.Adjusted FCF (Free Cash Flow) is calculated as cash flows from operating activities  plus IPO costs paid  if any  less other financial income and expenses classified as operating activities in the cash-flow statement  and less net cash relating to capital expenditures.Cash Conversion Rate is defined as Adjusted FCF divided by Adjusted EBITDA.Net cash position is defined as Cash minus indebtedness excluding lease liabilities.Net Retention Rate (NRR) calculated as the recurring revenue of a given 12-month period generated by customers having contributed to recurring revenue of the prior 12-month period  divided by total recurring revenue in the prior 12-month period  in constant currencies. A customer is considered as a new customer during the first 12 months they generate recurring revenue.Churn rate is calculated as the prior 12-month period recurring revenue from customers which did not contribute to recurring revenue in the given 12-month period  divided by the recurring revenue from all customers in the prior 12-month period.1 Non-IFRS measure.

SMO New Businesses remained dynamic  increasing +8% versus 2024 and now representing 19% of SMO’s total revenue.Segment adjusted EBITDAs at $32m  down -10% compared to 2024. Against lower activity levels and a strongly adverse currency effect (driven by US dollar depreciation while SMO’s cost base is primarily in euros) the cost-reduction efforts implemented over the past 24 months to lower SMO’s break-even point helped limit the impact on profitability.Segment adjusted operating income at $9m  up +114% year-on-year  with the margin more than doubling  positioning SMO well for improved profitability as activity recovers.CONSOLIDATED IFRS FIGURES3Profit & Loss: Net Income up a significant +40%Consolidated IFRS revenue for 2025 came in at $1 071m  down -12% year-on-year  with a $94m negative impact related to IFRS15 restatements.

As she reaches the end of her second term as CEO  the Board of Directors unanimously supports her remaining as Chair to ensure strategic continuity and guide Viridien’s long-term vision. Since 2018  her leadership has repositioned Viridien as an asset-light  technology-driven company with a stronger financial foundation and a more diversified portfolio.The Board also unanimously approved the appointment of Henning Berg as Viridien’s new CEO  effective June 3  2026. Henning Berg brings more than 27 years of experience in the oil and gas services industry  including several senior global leadership roles at SLB. He will join the Group on March 3  2026  as Chief Operating Officer  ensuring a structured and gradual transition to the CEO role. His appointment as Director will also be submitted for approval at the upcoming General MeetingOUTLOOKWhile short-term energy price volatility may result in some industry caution and softer activity in the first half of 2026  we anticipate a recovery in the second half. Under an overall business environment comparable to last year  Viridien expects to deliver around $100 million of Net Cash Flow in FY26  with a seasonal profile similar to 2025 and full allocation to further deleveraging.

Reference should be made to the section “Safe Harbor Statement” included elsewhere within this documentn.m - not meaningfulAMSTERDAM – February 26  2026 — Stellantis N.V. reported its Full Year 2025 results  with Net revenues of €153.5 billion  down 2% from 2024 due to strong FX headwinds and H1 2025 net pricing declines  which were partially offset by higher volume and mix. The Company posted a Net loss of €22.3 billion  driven by €25.4 billion in charges primarily related to a profound strategic shift to meet customer preferences  and reflect shifts in regulatory frameworks.In 2026  Stellantis' expanding product wave is broadening market coverage and targeting new opportunities for profitable growth. For example  in North America  the Jeep® Cherokee and Dodge Charger SIXPACK mark a decisive re‑entry into the mid‑SUV and ICE muscle‑car segments  with additional momentum expected from the late‑2025 launch of the Ram 1500 HEMI® V8 and Express models. In South America  the mid-size pickup Ram Dakota anchors the lineup  while in Enlarged Europe  the Citroën C5 Aircross BEV  the Jeep® Compass BEV and the recently launched Fiat 500 Hybrid further strengthen the Company's ability to meet the full range of its customers' needs.Company Delivers Return to Top-Line Growth in H2 2025Stellantis delivered a solid performance in the second half of 2025  with consolidated shipments reaching 2.8 million units—an increase of 277 000 vehicles  or +11% year-over-year. Growth was broad-based  with every region reporting higher volumes.North America posted the strongest contribution  adding 231 000 units—a +39% year-over-year increase  reflecting the benefits of normalized inventory dynamics  compared with the prior year's inventory reduction initiative  along with increased commercial momentum in the region.Stellantis' Net revenues in H2 2025 rose 10% compared with the same period in 2024.These results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies  disciplined commercial strategies  and the strength of Stellantis’ global brand portfolio. Furthermore  the renewed focus on quality management is delivering early results  with the number of issues reported for vehicles in their first month of service decreasing by over 50% in North America  and by over 30% in Enlarged Europe since the beginning of 2025.Executes Decisive Reset to Align with Customers and Support Profitable GrowthOn February 6  2026  Stellantis announced a major reset of its business  resulting in approximately €22.2 billion in charges  excluded from AOI  for the second half of 2025  of which about €6.5 billion are cash payments expected to be made over the next four years. These charges include:Resetting the product plan and EV supply chain to reflect customer demand and shifting regulations;A change in the estimation process for contractual warranty provisions; andOther charges  mainly related to previously announced workforce reductions in Enlarged Europe.In addition  the reset has empowered regional teams to accelerate decision-making and improve effectiveness across all business areas  while working to build closer  more productive relationships with the Company's dealer  supplier  institutional and union stakeholders.2026 Guidance Reiterated Projecting Progressive Improvement in Net Revenue  AOI  and IFCFThe Company expects to see a mid-single-digit percent increase in Net revenues  a low-single-digit AOI margin  and improved Industrial free cash flow generation year over year. Sequential improvement is also expected from the first half to the second half of the year.Upcoming EventsFull Year 2025 Results Management Call - February 26  2026  at 2:00 p.m. CET / 8:00 a.m. EST.

In addition to the volumes included in consolidated shipments  combined shipments also includes the vehicles distributed by our joint ventures (such as Tofas). Figures by segments may not add up due to rounding.(2) Adjusted operating income/(loss) excludes from Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations adjustments comprising restructuring and other termination costs  impairments  asset write-offs  disposals of investments and unusual operating income/(expense) that are considered rare or discrete events and are infrequent in nature  as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance  and also excludes Net financial expenses/(income) and Tax expense/(benefit).Unusual operating income/(expense) are impacts from strategic decisions  as well as events considered rare or discrete and infrequent in nature  as inclusion of such items is not considered to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Unusual operating income/(expense) includes  but may not be limited to: impacts from strategic decisions to rationalize Stellantis' core operations; facility-related costs stemming from Stellantis' plans to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand  and convergence and integration costs directly related to significant acquisitions or mergers.(3) Adjusted operating income/(loss) margin is calculated as Adjusted operating income/(loss) divided by Net revenues.(4) Industrial free cash flows is our key cash flow metric and is calculated as Cash flows from operating activities less: (i) cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations; (ii) cash flows from operating activities related to financial services  net of eliminations; (iii) investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities; (iv) contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments; and adjusted for: (i) net intercompany payments between continuing operations and discontinued operations; (ii) proceeds from disposal of assets and (iii) contributions to defined benefit pension plans  net of tax. The timing of Industrial free cash flows may be affected by the timing of monetization of receivables  factoring and the payment of accounts payables  as well as changes in other components of working capital  which can vary from period to period due to  among other things  cash management initiatives and other factors  some of which may be outside of the Company’s control. In addition  Industrial free cash flows is one of the metrics used in the determination of the annual performance bonus for eligible employees  including members of the senior management.(5) Effective H1 2025  two types of cash flows were reclassified to cash flows from operating activities: (i) the net change in receivables related to financial services activities have been reclassified from investing activities as these are part of our principal revenue-generating activities and (ii) certain financial receivables related to factoring transactions from financing activities. Comparative figures for FY 2024 and H2 2024 have been reclassified accordingly.(€ million) FY 2024 as reported Adjustment: Financial services activities Adjustment: Financial receivables FY 2024 as adjusted Cash flows from operating activities 4 008 (3 455) 982 1 535 Less: Financial services  net of inter-segment eliminations (2 736) 3 455 (982) (5 209) Less: Capital Expenditures and capitalized research and development expenditures and change in amounts payable on property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities 10 761 — — 10 761 Add: Proceeds from disposal of assets and other changes in investing activities 303 — — 303 Less: Contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments 2 376 — — 2 376 Add: Defined benefit pension contributions  net of tax 45 — — 45 Industrial free cash flows (6 045) — — (6 045)(€ million) H2 2024 as reported Adjustment: Financial services activities Adjustment: Financial receivables H2 2024 as adjusted Cash flows from operating activities (881) (1 716) 162 (2 435) Less: Financial services  net of inter-segment eliminations (1 271) 1 716 (162) (2 825) Less: Capital Expenditures and capitalized research and development expenditures and change in amounts payable on property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for industrial activities 5 323 — — 5 323 Add: Proceeds from disposal of assets and other changes in investing activities 140 — — 140 Less: Contributions of equity to joint ventures and minor acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and equity method and other investments 881 — — 881 Add: Defined benefit pension contributions  net of tax 21 — — 21 Industrial free cash flows (5 653) — — (5 653)(6) Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") is calculated by adjusting Diluted earnings per share for the post-tax impact per share of the same items excluded from Adjusted operating income as well as tax expense/(benefit) items that are considered rare or infrequent  or whose nature would distort the presentation of the ongoing tax charge of the Company. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful because it also excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and provides investors with a more meaningful comparison of the Company’s ongoing quality of earnings. Adjusted diluted EPS should not be considered as a substitute for Basic earnings per share  Diluted earnings per share from operations or other methods of analyzing our quality of earnings as reported under IFRS.(7) Industrial net financial position is calculated as Debt plus derivative financial liabilities related to industrial activities less (i) cash and cash equivalents  (ii) financial securities that are considered liquid  (iii) current financial receivables from the Company or its jointly controlled financial services entities and (iv) derivative financial assets and collateral deposits. Therefore  debt  cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets/ liabilities pertaining to Stellantis’ financial services entities are excluded from the computation of the Industrial net financial position. Industrial net financial position includes the Industrial net financial position classified as held for sale.8) Financial securities are comprised of short term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments but do not satisfy all the requirements to be classified as cash equivalents as they may be subject to risk of change in value (even if they are short-term in nature or marketable).(9) The majority of our liquidity is available to our treasury operations in Europe and U.S.; however  liquidity is also available to certain subsidiaries which operate in other countries. Cash held in such countries may be subject to restrictions on transfer depending on the foreign jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. Based on our review of such transfer restrictions in the countries in which we operate and maintain material cash balances  (and in particular in Argentina  in which we have €354 million cash and securities at December 31  2025 (€680 million at December 31  2024)  and in Algeria  in which we have €276 million cash at December 31  2025 (€276 million at December 31  2024))  we do not believe such transfer restrictions had an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity requirements at the dates presented above. Cash and cash equivalents also include €663 million at December 31  2025 (€451 million at December 31  2024) held in bank deposits which are restricted to the operations related to securitization programs and warehouses credit facilities of SFS U.S.Rankings  market share and other industry information are derived from third-party industry sources (e.g. Agence Nationale des Titres Sécurisés (ANTS)  Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores (ANFAVEA)  Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility (MIMS)  S&P Global  Ward’s Automotive) and internal information unless otherwise stated.For purposes of this document  and unless otherwise stated industry and market share information are for passenger cars (PC) plus light commercial vehicles (LCV)  except as noted below:Enlarged Europe excludes Russia and Belarus.

In two months  we have already demonstrated our ability to deliver on these strategic ambitions  with €1.65 billion of disposals announced to date  highlighting the quality of these assets  and over €500 million of shareholder returns in 2026 through share buybacks and dividend.In 2026  we will continue the rollout of WIM  which now operates in three asset classes: private equity  private debt  and private market solutions  and which is expected to exceed €200 million of pro forma FRE. WIM will represent already 38% of Wendel assets  pro forma of Committed Advisors’ acquisition and Stahl and IHS disposals.

See page 285 of the 2024 Registration Document.Wendel’s Principal Investments’ portfolio rotationIn 2025 Wendel realized a total of €1.3 billion in disposals for its own account:On March 12  2025  Wendel implemented a prepaid 3-year forward sale representing approximately 6.7% of Bureau Veritas share capital. The transaction immediately generated net cash proceeds of approximately €750M to Wendel.On September 16  2025  Wendel successfully disposed of 23.3 million Bureau Veritas shares underlying the exchangeable bond into Bureau Veritas shares issued by Wendel in March 2023 and maturing in March 2026  for a total amount of approximately €591M.Wendel reinvested c.€100M in Scalian in 2025 to support its external growth and to strengthen its balance sheet.Early 2026  Wendel announced the following transactions:Sale of Stahl: a significant step forward in our €7bn capital allocation strategy announced in December 2025. Wendel has entered into an agreement to sell its stake in Stahl (excluding Muno) for an enterprise value of €2.1 billion to Henkel  a German-headquartered global coatings and adhesives leader serving a broad range of industrial and consumer end markets. The contemplated transaction values Stahl at a level that would yield total net proceeds at completion (after debt and transaction costs) of c.€1.2 billion for Wendel. This corresponds to a multiple of 6.6 times Wendel’s total investment since 2006  including €427m of past proceeds thanks to Stahl’s robust cash generation. This represents an annualized IRR of over 15% over 20 years. This compares with a value of €960 million in Wendel’s net asset value (“NAV”) published before the transaction announcement  as of September 30  2025.

While general and administrative expenses were slightly lower  net financial income (€-11.5 million in 2025 compared with +€35.6 million in the previous year) no longer benefited from the very significant treasury income recorded in 2024  which resulted from an exceptionally high cash balance during the period and a materially higher average short-term interest rate environment than in 2025.Net income from operations therefore remained stable at €753.0 million compared with €753.7 million in 2024  while net income from operations attributable to the Group amounted to €161.2 million  down 30.7%.Consolidated net income for 2025 totaled +€344.7 million (€-151.8 million attributable to the Group)  down year on year due to non-recurring items and acquisition-related accounting charges 2024 included a €692 million capital gain on the disposal of Constantia Flexibles.

This major step follows the Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier this year and marks a significant milestone in the technical development of DEZiR  providing the level of definition needed to de-risk the project and pave the way towards EPC execution. As the first industrial scale eSAF initiative in France to reach the FEED stage and among the most advanced in Europe  DEZiR underscores the strategic importance of advancing innovative solutions to decarbonize the aviation sector. The project is part of a broader initiative by Verso Energy to develop with Rely seven e-Fuels production plants worldwide. Together  these facilities aim to produce over 500 000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually  with up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.Rely secures engineering studies contract with H4 Marseille Fos for European Green Aviation Fuel HubRely has been awarded to assist H4 Marseille Fos in early engineering studies to solidify plant definition and support permitting for a landmark project dedicated to producing sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) in Fos-sur-Mer  Bouches du Rhône  France. This initiative aims to position the industrial-port zone as a European hub for hydrogen and e-SAF production  supporting France’s and Europe’s decarbonization ambitions. 75 000 tons of e-SAF will be produced annually from green hydrogen produced by 300MW water electrolyzers  and from captured CO 2   with first production expected in 2030. This project exemplifies a significant step toward reindustrializing France in line with Europe’s ambition for sustainable aviation. A key aspect of this project is the potential of methanol-to-jet fuel synthesis pathway  which offers a promising route for decarbonizing aviation. Methanol  produced from green hydrogen and captured carbon  will be converted into high-quality jet fuel  providing a scalable solution that can be used without modifying aircraft.Corporate and other items - adjusted IFRSCorporate costs  excluding non-recurring items  were €54.9 million for the full year 2025 and in line with the Company guidance range of €50 - 60 million. Corporate costs included the impact of the share price increase and supplemental French social charges on long-term incentive plans that notably affected the first half of 2025.Non-recurring expense amounted to €80.7 million. This includes costs incurred relating to investment in adjacent business models  particularly for Reju  merger & acquisition activity  including the Advanced Materials & Catalysts (AM&C) transaction  as well as other strategic initiatives  and restructuring costs.Net financial income of €88.6 million benefited from interest income generated from cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by the cost of debt  lease expenses and pension costs. The lower trend relative to full year 2024 net financial income reflects the gradual reduction in global interest rates.Effective tax rate was 29.7% for the full year 2025  consistent with the 2025 guidance range of 26%-30%.Depreciation and amortization expense was €123.2 million  of which €78.5 million is related to IFRS 16.Gross cash at December 31  2025 was €3.8 billion  which compares to €4.1 billion at December 31  2024. Gross debt was €1.0 billion at December 31  2025  and has increased relative to the position at December 31  2024 as the Company utilized short-term debt instruments to partially finance the transaction of AM&C.Free cash flow was €519.3 million for the full year 2025. Free cash flow  excluding the working capital and provisions variance of €22.3 million  was €497.0 million  benefiting from strong operational performance and consistently high conversion from recurring EBITDA of 78% (conversion from recurring EBIT was 97%). Free cash flow is stated after capital expenditures of €89.0 million. The higher capital expenditures year-over-year reflect investments for the ongoing expansion of Technip Energies’ Dahej facility in India  as well as the continued modernization of other facilities and laboratories. Operating cash flow was €608.3 million.Liquidity - adjusted IFRSLiquidity of €4.6 billion at December 31  2025 comprised of €3.8 billion of cash and €750 million of liquidity provided by the Company’s undrawn Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). On December 31  2025  S&P Global Ratings re-affirmed its ‘BBB’ long-term issuer credit rating on Technip Energies  with a stable outlook.Capital allocation and shareholder returnsThe strength of the Company’s balance sheet  with ~€1.0 billion net cash  adjusted for project-associated cash  coupled with sustainable free cash flow generation  underpins Technip Energies’ commitment to a disciplined and effective capital allocation that prioritizes shareholder returns and accretive investments while maintaining its investment grade balance sheet.

I won’t start with the headlines this time—something I’ve been doing lately—in order to offer some fresh “news tidbits ” not just the daily grind. So  I’ve learned that Kyriakos Pierrakakis has been breathing fire these days… at the bankers. My source tells me he’s extremely irritated with them because  as he puts it  “we’re trying to assess the impact on the banking system from the Supreme Court decision  and they’re busy figuring out how to squeeze yet another ATM fee out of ordinary people. How greedy can they be?” Let me explain: Pierr doesn’t care in the slightest whether bank profitability will be affected by the Areios Pagos ruling on non-performing loans—which  truth be told  will cost them dearly (but they should have been more careful). What matters is preventing the logic of that ruling from being extended “to everything and everywhere” in the credit system and blowing the whole thing up. Try explaining that to the public  though  given what they see banks doing every single day. In any case  a few days ago Pierrakakis had his services—triggered by an incident in which one bank charged another digital bank ATM fees—send out a circular reminding them that “no-fee” rules apply to everyone and to everything. I’m told there will be follow-up soon.The minimum wageA lot of debate has opened up over the minimum wage and the size of the increases to be announced in March. Kyriakos Mitsotakis wants to put the brakes on a maximalist discussion  which is why Niki Kerameus appeared yesterday to remind everyone that  toward the pre-election target of €950 in 2027  only about €70 now remain. Therefore  the increase could be split into two equal installments this year and next. K.M. knows he doesn’t have to reckon only with workers  but also with businesses—which  in this case  are the ones footing the bill.Today’s cabinet: the bill on illegal gamblingI hear the Ministry of Finance is in “bill mode.” Pierrakakis and his team have been working over the past few days on the final details of provisions to tackle illegal gambling  so that the final draft can be presented at today’s cabinet meeting and  once approved  sent on for consultation and passage. According to my sources  the proposed framework provides for a substantial strengthening of the Hellenic Gambling Commission  in staffing  institutional powers  and even investigative authority. As for the bill’s footprint  just consider the enormous sums moving through illegal betting: well over €1.5 billion annually. It’s clear we’re talking about a real risk of asset loss  with the Finance Ministry aiming to reduce citizens’ exposure to uncertified and unsafe betting outlets.Samaras–ChevronRegular readers of the column may have noticed our restraint in commenting on Antonis Samaras  and there are several reasons. Samaras served the country during difficult years in office  endured 15 years of political exile after bringing down—through political entanglements—a lawfully elected government of his own party  and recently has been living through an unspeakable personal tragedy. Yesterday’s move  however—accusing the government of surrendering sovereign rights through the signing with Chevron—doesn’t warrant criticism; it’s simply what you’d call a dud.The risk and the responseUnder other circumstances  the Maximos Mansion would not have responded to Samaras. But because the former prime minister raised issues that the ND right wing could seize upon as a banner in the coming period  the government chose yesterday to respond—centrally  even if via leaks from government officials. I find it interesting that Maximos spoke of “habitual  out-of-touch statements ” effectively portraying Samaras as “something of a quaint figure by now.” All in all  it’s just sad.Against his own peopleSince we’re talking about Samaras  it’s noteworthy that he now openly positions himself against his own people. He’s done so in the Peloponnese  where he barely speaks to regional governor Dimitris Ptochos  whom he accuses of being too “Mitsotakis-aligned ” even though he was once his own protégé. He did the same with yesterday’s statement on Chevron  the contract and file for which were handled by Stavros Papastavrou—who had done similar work with contracts and legal texts at Maximos during Samaras’s tenure.PASOK oléNow on to PASOK news. First  listen to and watch Anna Diamantopoulou’s interview with Evgenidis (protothema.gr). I’ll refrain from comment out of courtesy (she gave it to us  after all)  but you can really tell—from what she says—what’s going on inside the Movement. What I can’t help commenting on is the incredible reply by Geroulanos  when a TV journalist (Papachlimintzos) asks him: “Mr. Geroulanos  you see that 68% of people in the polls are dissatisfied with the government  and only 12% trust PASOK with their vote— isn’t that a problem?” And what does fearless Pavlaras answer? “Of course! You see it as a problem; I see it as an opportunity to rise.” Fsss… Boeing.Brad Pitt – €2.5 millionI’m following with great interest the filming of The Riders on Hydra with beloved Brad Pitt. I think that if the movie is even halfway decent  it’ll be huge promotion for the country—and for Hydra  of course. I asked whether the film received a subsidy from EKOME  and I was officially told it will receive around €2.5 million. And that’s little  considering the millions that get poured into Greek dud series  mostly for backroom-dealing and entanglement reasons. We said it before: our government is perpetually… well-rounded—playing both sides  and especially prone to doing favors. What can you do.The Swiss franc regulationAlthough banks initially reacted  the government’s regulation on Swiss franc loans is already drawing significant interest from borrowers. With the simplification of the complex bankruptcy-law system—which may remove legal substance from certain cases—reports have begun reaching the European Union. It is clarified  therefore  that so far no violation of EU law has been identified  nor has any related procedure been initiated. Of course  the Commission always retains the right to request additional information or clarifications from member states on similar regulations.The Katseli Law billStaying with banks: early this morning Piraeus Bank will announce its 2025 results  and at 14:00 management will brief analysts. Latest information suggests a dividend of around €0.44 per share is expected and will meet market expectations. In the afternoon Eurobank will announce results  and tomorrow National Bank of Greece along with Alpha Bank. No crystal ball is needed to predict that analysts will try to extract from bank management their estimates of the impact of the recent Areios Pagos ruling on the interest calculation of Katseli Law loans. Analysts will ask  but it’s obviously difficult to get answers before the judges’ decision and reasoning are formally written up and published. Without knowing the full rationale  chief economists can’t accurately assess the extent of potential exposure  and thus banks can’t (yet) make additional provisions.Mezzanine under pressureIn any case  the Supreme Court decision on the interest calculation of Katseli Law loans doesn’t concern only the four systemic banks. Experienced market watchers point out that the ruling will significantly affect mezzanine bonds of securitizations traded on the Athens Stock Exchange. This is a segment relatively unknown to the wider investing public  though not to institutions. Greek mezzanine tranches of “red loan” securitizations were issued under the Hercules scheme and are backed mainly by non-performing loans  a significant share of which fall under Katseli Law arrangements. How interest is calculated on these loans directly affects the cash flows feeding bond repayments  and thus their valuation. If the court’s reasoning forces servicers to revise interest methods retroactively  projected collections change—along with the credit quality of mezzanine tranches. That means pressure on trading prices  especially for titles already near the limits of their base assumptions.Exarchou’s new dealsInformation suggests that Alexandros Exarchou won’t stop at the commercial agreements for buying and selling U.S. LNG in Southeast Europe concluded recently in the U.S.; new ones with other countries are already in the works. The Vertical Corridor story is proving to be a historic opportunity to enhance the country’s geopolitical significance and pave the way for major energy investments. The volume secured in the U.S. by the AKTOR–DEPA partnership creates needs for critical infrastructure  with a new FSRU being just one of them.And thus Euronext Athens was bornIt’s official—and significant—that yesterday  Wednesday February 25  the company “Euronext Athens S.A.” was established  following the acquisition of the Athens Exchange by the Euronext Group. The new company is headquartered at 110 Athinon Avenue and has initial share capital of €25 000  fully covered by founding shareholder “Hellenic Exchanges–Athens Stock Exchange Holdings S.A.” Its purpose is “to carry out activities relating to the provision of services for organizing stock market transactions  exchange operations  and market management in accordance with applicable law ” along with several secondary activities. The first board—with a distinctly Franco-Italian flavor—includes Camille Wael Beudin as Chairman  Ioannis Kontopoulos as CEO  and Sébastien Anthony Emile d’Herbes  Emilie Rieupeyroux  Giorgio Riccardo Maria Alfonso Modica  and Manuela Bassi as non-executive members. Most are already familiar  having staffed the new HCMC board since January 22. The board’s term will be four years  until 25/2/2030.Fessas’s move on FourlisQuest Holdings of the Fessas Group’s move to acquire a 5% stake in the Fourlis Group continues to spark comments and scenarios. The stake was built gradually; until recently Quest held 4.86%  rising to 5.05% after recent purchases. From the Fessas side  it’s said this participation has no strategic or hostile intent—just an investment bet on Fourlis’s prospects. Time will tell whether it’s purely investment. Especially whether those prospects  recognized by the market after the management change  will be confirmed. Competition in the group’s retail segments has intensified. Even IKEA  long playing solo in home furnishings  now faces strong rivals like JYSK  which rapidly built a strong network in Greece  while Praktiker  recently acquired by Romania’s Dedeman  is expected to move aggressively. In sporting goods  there’s also a bloodbath for market share  as well as in wellness products  where Fourlis is present via Holland & Barrett  for which all options are being considered. Quest’s entry announcement sparked fresh buying interest  and the stock rose about 7% in just two sessions.Angeliki  Tsantanis  and the ChineseWhile new shipbuilding orders slowed during Asian holidays  Seanergy Maritime Holdings  led by Stamatis Tsantanis  didn’t sit idle. Two new bulker orders strengthen the fleet renewal program begun last year  including a sister ship to the already ordered 181 000 dwt capesize at Hengli Heavy Industries  costing $75.2 million. The second  a 211 000 dwt newcastlemax  is priced at $75.8 million  with delivery in 2028. And as if that weren’t enough  Anna Angelicoussis’s Pantheon Tankers Management is closing four VLCCs at Hengli Heavy Industry.US Tariffs and the Concern for Greek-Owned ShippingThe decision of the US Supreme Court to overturn Trump-era tariffs has not reassured the shipping industry. Instead  it opens a new cycle of policy recalibration with potential consequences for trade flows  creating a high-risk environment for container shipping. The sector is closely monitoring every move from Washington. Section 122  which allows the United States to permit the temporary import of goods without full payment of duties under specific conditions  if raised to 15%  increases costs for imports from the EU and the United Kingdom  while reducing costs for imports from certain Asian countries. For Greek-owned and international shipping  the possibility of “front-loading” cargoes ahead of higher tariffs may lead to a temporary surge in demand for capacity and upward pressure on freight rates. The biggest issue  however  is uncertainty about the next step. Section 301 tariffs  which allow the US government to impose additional duties or import restrictions on products from specific countries  have no fixed time limit and can change very quickly. For shipping companies  this means that cargo flows and transport contracts must be adjusted based on constantly shifting scenarios. The involvement of the US Department of Commerce  with simultaneous investigations into “major trading partners ” reinforces the sense that the rules will remain volatile and compliance costs high. Although Section 122 tariffs are temporarily lower for Asian imports  the subsequent application of Section 301 measures could restore—or significantly increase—transport costs. For Greek-owned bulk and container vessels operating on US routes  this uncertainty means that loading schedules  freight pricing  and capacity management require greater flexibility and continuous monitoring. In essence  Wall Street and shipping analysts see that US tariff policy has not changed direction; it has simply adopted more transparent and legally resilient procedures. The outcome for shipping remains the same: higher cost volatility  the potential for increased freight rates  and the need for strategic adjustment in both the short and medium term. Greek-owned and international shipping are therefore called upon to manage this fluid environment in a way that limits risks to profitability  while new disruptions cannot be ruled out as Washington moves forward with Section 301 tariffs and possible retaliatory actions from the EU  Japan  or South Korea.OTE in High Frequencies – Reaches the €18 MilestoneOTE shares are posting an impressive performance  reaching levels last seen in the summer of 2022. The stock broke through the technical threshold of €18 and closed at a four-year high  as investors anticipate positive announcements this morning regarding the group’s 2025 results  guidance for the current year  and the upcoming dividend. At the same time  the market is pricing in a series of additional catalysts giving fresh momentum to the stock. At the top of the agenda is the strategic focus on accelerating investments in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)  alongside a gradual improvement in profit margins in the German market through parent company Deutsche Telekom  which now appears to be giving the “green light” for a more aggressive dividend policy. Analysts note that OTE is increasingly viewed as a “safe bet” in a period of heightened volatility. Strong free cash flow generation and the ongoing share buyback program provide a solid safety net  while improved domestic competitive conditions allow the company to maintain market share. OTE also appears to have left behind a long consolidation phase and is now looking toward new multi-year highs—levels last seen in May 2008—with institutional investors re-entering the stock as part of portfolio rotation  seeing in OTE a blend of defensive protection and growth potential.The Downfall of LagardeAfter years at the heart of Europe’s power corridors  Christine Lagarde  President of the European Central Bank  is facing a painful downfall. The Financial Times revealed—and Bloomberg confirmed—that Lagarde is preparing to step down early from the ECB  ahead of the French presidential elections in April 2027 and before the official end of her term in October of that year. The reason cited for her early departure is her desire to allow French President Macron and German Chancellor Merz to choose her successor before Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella potentially come to power in France. Bloomberg’s survey shows that more than half of economists expect her departure this year  while fewer than 30% believe she will complete her term. The leading successor is Klaas Knot. New revelations are now emerging. In a written response to MEPs Fabio De Masi and Dick Eriksson  Lagarde disclosed—for the first time—that she received CHF 130 457 from the Bank for International Settlements in 2025 (around €140 000). This payment relates to her role as a member of the BIS Board  the institution that brings together the heads of the world’s major central banks. ECB internal rules explicitly prohibit staff from accepting third-party remuneration for activities carried out as part of their official duties. This applies even to the ECB employee accompanying her to BIS meetings  who is not allowed to receive a single euro from the same organization. Beneath the media reports  bitter comments from ECB staff have surfaced. “Preach water  drink wine!” wrote one anonymous employee. Officially  the ECB argues that Lagarde is subject to a different code of conduct than other central bankers. Jerome Powell  head of the Federal Reserve  and Andrew Bailey  Governor of the Bank of England  do not claim any remuneration from the BIS. With total annual earnings estimated at €743 000  Lagarde is now considered the highest-paid official in the European Union—a central banker preaching austerity and fiscal discipline while receiving benefits denied to her own staff.When Money Runs Faster Than GrowthAsk any banker or market professional about the trajectory of the markets and they will immediately point to unprecedented liquidity. There is a single indicator—and it has broken all historical records. The Broad Supply Money Index reached $144 trillion last December  marking an annual increase of $13.6 trillion  or +10.4%. This is the third consecutive acceleration in the growth of the BMS Index. From 2000 to today  global money supply increased by $118 trillion  with a compound annual growth rate of +7%. After the 2020 pandemic  the increase amounted to $44 trillion—+44% in just five years. The fastest growth rate was recorded in February 2021  at +18.7%  at the peak of pandemic-era monetary expansion. These are the good news—for financial markets. The problem is that this pace of money growth (+10.4% globally) is not justified by real economic growth. Global GDP is expanding at just 2.5% to 3%. This vast gap between available money and global growth fuels two parallel phenomena: the depreciation of the US dollar as a reserve currency  and the continuous appreciation of “hard” assets such as gold  real estate  and equities backed by tangible assets. Global liquidity remains abundant and continues to support markets in the short term.
