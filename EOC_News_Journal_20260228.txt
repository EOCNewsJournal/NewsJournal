The Policy also applies to members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company where remuneration is paid for work performed outside the directorship.The Policy is  together with previous years’ Policies  available on the Company’s website  www.orron.com  and it will remain available for ten years.Key remuneration principles at the CompanyThe Company’s remuneration principles and policies are designed to ensure responsible and sustainable remuneration decisions that support the Company’s strategy  shareholders’ long-term interests and sustainable business practices. It is the aim of the Company to recruit  motivate and retain high calibre executives capable of achieving the objectives of the Company and to encourage and appropriately and fairly reward executives for their contributions to the Company’s success.Remuneration to members of the BoardIn addition to Board fees resolved by the General Meeting  remuneration as per prevailing market conditions may be paid to members of the Board for work performed outside the directorship.Compensation CommitteeThe Board has established a Compensation Committee to support it on matters of remuneration relating to the CEO  the Deputy CEO (if appointed)  other members of Group Management and other key employees of the Company. The objective of the Committee is to structure and implement remuneration principles to achieve the Company’s strategy  the principal matters for consideration being:the review and implementation of the Company’s remuneration principles for Group Management  including this Policy which requires approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders;the remuneration of the CEO and the Deputy CEO (if appointed)  as well as other members of Group Management  and any other specific remuneration issues arising;the design of long-term incentive plans that require approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders; andcompliance with relevant rules and regulatory provisions  such as this Policy  the Swedish Companies Act  the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and the Swedish Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee’s Rules on Remuneration of the Board and Executive Management and on Incentive Programmes.When the Compensation Committee makes decisions  including determining  reviewing and implementing the Policy  it follows a process where:the Board sets and reviews the terms of reference of the Committee;the Chair of the Committee approves the Committee’s agenda;the Committee considers any reports  data and presentations and debates any proposal. In its considerations the Committee will give due regard to the Company’s situation  the general and industry specific remuneration environment  the remuneration and terms of employment of the broader employee population  feedback from different stakeholders  relevant codes  regulations and guidelines published from time to time;the Committee may request the advice and assistance of management representatives  other internal expertise and of external advisors. However  it shall ensure that there is no conflict of interest regarding other assignments that any such advisors may have for the Company and Group Management;the Committee ensures through a requirement to notify and recuse oneself that no individual with a conflict of interest will take part in a remuneration decision that may compromise such a decision;once the Committee is satisfied that it has been properly and sufficiently informed  it will make its decisions and  where required  formulate proposals for approval by the Board; andthe Board will consider any items for approval or proposals from the Committee and  following its own discussions  make decisions  proposals for a General Meeting of Shareholders and/or further requests for the Committee to deliberate on.Elements of remuneration for Group ManagementThere are four key elements to the remuneration of Group Management: Description  purpose and link to strategy and sustainability Process and governance Relative share of total reward* a) Base salary Fixed cash remuneration paid monthly. Provides predictable remuneration to aid attraction and retention of key talent. The Committee reviews salaries every year as part of the review of total remuneration (see below for a description of the benchmarking process). 30% b) Annual variable remuneration Annual bonus is paid for performance over the financial year.Each position has a set expected bonus opportunity  which can be up to the equivalent of 12 months’ base salary.Any value awarded by the Board that is more than 12 months’ base salary is paid for delivering outstanding performance  subject to a maximum cap of 18 months base salary.Signals and rewards the strategic and operational results and behaviours expected for the year that contribute to the long-term  sustainable value creation of the Company. The annual review of total remuneration also considers annual bonus awards  outcomes  target structure  weightings of targets and specific target levels of performance.Measurable financial and non-financial performance requirements are identified according to position and responsibilities and include delivery against power generation  investment  financial  ESG and strategic targets.The Committee reviews the design of annual variable remuneration separately. 15% c) Long-term incentive plan Annual awards of equity- based long-term incentives  approved by the General Meeting  that align the interests of participants with those of shareholders.Awards may be granted with a fair value of up to 300% of base salary at award. Annual review of total remuneration considers long-term incentive awards and outcomes.Participants are required to build a significant personal shareholding of up to 100% of base salary (200% for the CEO) over time by retaining 50% of exercised shares  net of tax  until the predetermined limit for the personal shareholding has been achieved.The Committee reviews the design of long-term incentives separately. 50% d) Benefits Predictable benefits to help facilitate the discharge of each executive’s duties  aiding the attraction and retention of key talent. The Committee reviews benefits and contractual terms regularly to ensure that the Company does not fall behind the market.Benefits are set with reference to external market practices  internal practices  position and relevant reference remuneration. 5% Total 100%*Estimated reward shows the percentage of total reward where proportions are estimated assuming 50 per cent of maximum annual bonus and the fair value of the long-term incentive without any further share price or dividend effect. The proportions for maximum remuneration are based on full allocation of both annual variable remuneration and long-term incentive  without taking into account any further effects of changes in the share price. Different actual awards and the variable nature of incentives means that the actual proportions for an individual may be different.Review and benchmarkingThe Compensation Committee undertakes reviews of the Company’s remuneration policies and practices considering the total remuneration of each executive as well as the individual components. Levels are set considering:the total remuneration opportunity;the external pay market;the scope and responsibilities of the position;the skills  experience and performance of the individual;the Company’s performance  affordability of reward and general market conditions; andlevels and increases in remuneration  as well as other terms of employment  for other positions within the Company.External benchmarks for total remuneration are acquired when the Committee considers it necessary  consisting of one or more sets of companies that compete with the Company for talent  taking into consideration factors like size  complexity  geography and business profile when determining such peer groups.Variable remunerationThe Company considers that variable remuneration forms important parts of executives’ remuneration packages  where associated performance targets reflect the key drivers for pursuing the Company’s strategy  and to achieve sustainable value creation and growth in long-term shareholder value. The Committee ensures that performance and design align with the strategic direction and risk appetite of the Company before incentives are approved by the Board.There is no deferral of incentive payments  however  the Board can recover annual bonuses paid in the unlikely event of outcomes based on information which is subsequently proven to have been manifestly misstated. The Board can also in exceptional circumstances reduce long-term incentive awards  including reducing them to zero  should it consider the vesting outcome to incorrectly reflect the true performance of the Company.BenefitsBenefits provided shall be based on market terms and shall facilitate the discharge of each executive’s duties. The pension provision is the main benefit and follows the local practice of the geography where the individual is based. The pension benefits consist of a basic defined contribution pension plan  where the employer provides 60 per cent and the employee 40 per cent of an annual contribution of up to 18 per cent of the capped pensionable salary and  at the Board’s discretion  a supplemental defined contribution pension plan where the employer provides 60 per cent and the employee 40 per cent of a contribution up to 14 per cent of the capped pensionable salary.Severance arrangementsExecutives have rolling contracts where mutual notice periods of up to twelve months apply between the Company and the executive. In addition  severance terms are incorporated into the employment contracts for executives that give rise to compensation in the event of termination of employment due to a change of control of the Company. Such compensation  together with applicable notice periods  shall not exceed 24 months’ base salary.The Board is further authorised  in individual cases  to approve severance arrangements  in addition to the notice periods and the severance arrangements in respect of a change of control of the Company  where employment is terminated by the Company without cause  or otherwise in circumstances at the discretion of the Board. Such severance arrangements may provide for the payment of up to 12 months’ base salary.In all circumstances  severance payments in aggregate (i.e. for notice periods and severance arrangements) shall be limited to a maximum of 24 months’ base salary.Item 20: Resolution for the 2026 Long-term  Performance-based Incentive Plan (LTIP 2026)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish a long-term  performance-based incentive plan in respect of Group Management and a number of key employees of Orrön Energy on the terms and conditions set out below (“LTIP 2026”). The LTIP 2026 follows the same principles as the long-term  performance-based incentive plan approved by the 2025 Annual General Meeting.Background and purposeThe reason for establishing LTIP 2026 is to align the interests of Group Management and other key employees with the interests of the shareholders  and to provide market appropriate reward reflecting continuity  performance and commitment. The Board of Directors believes that the proposed LTIP 2026 will provide Orrön Energy with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to attract and retain executives who are critical to Orrön Energy’s future success.The performance-based LTIP 2026 has been designed by the Compensation Committee based on market practice and through engagement with the Company’s shareholders and other stakeholders. The plan has performance conditions related to total shareholder return and strategic targets which determine the final award for the long-term incentive plan.It is considered that the LTIP 2026  as the share option plans in the past  is best financed through delivery of shares allowing the Company to continue to allocate all available capital towards growth.The Board of Directors intends to propose to future Annual General Meetings to establish long-term incentive (“LTI”) plans based on principles corresponding to the currently proposed LTIP 2026. In order to be eligible to participate in such future LTI plans  each participant needs to build towards a meaningful shareholding in Orrön Energy  meaning that a certain portion of any allotted shares pursuant to LTIP 2026 (and any future LTI plans) shall be retained until the required level of shareholding has been met.Implementation of LTIP 2026The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2026 resolves on the implementation of the LTIP 2026 in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.Terms and conditions(a) Awards under LTIP 2026 are proposed to be made to approximately 9 permanent employees of the Orrön Energy Group (the “Participants”)  comprising the CEO and other members of Group Management  as well as certain other key employees. The Board of Directors may  within the total number of shares available under LTIP 2026  invite a limited number of additional Participants in LTIP 2026 following recruitment to the Orrön Energy Group.(b) LTIP 2026 gives the Participants the possibility to receive shares in Orrön Energy subject to uninterrupted employment and the fulfilment of performance conditions over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 May 2026 and expiring on 30 April 2029 (the “Performance Period”). The performance condition is two-fold  where the two conditions have a 75 per cent and 25 per cent weighting in determining the vesting of awards under LTIP 2026 (the “Performance Conditions”). The first Performance Condition is based on the share price growth and dividends (“Total Shareholder Return”) of the Orrön Energy share compared to the Total Shareholder Return of a peer group of companies (the “Peer Group”) (the “Total Shareholder Return Performance Condition”)  with a 75 per cent weighting. The second Performance Condition is based on the achievement of strategic performance targets (the “Strategic Performance Condition”)  with a 25 per cent weighting. At the beginning of the Performance Period  the Participants will  free of charge  be granted awards (“LTIP Awards”) which  to the extent that i.a. one or both Performance Conditions are partially or fully met  entitle the Participant to be allotted  also free of charge  shares in Orrön Energy (“Performance Shares”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the end of the Performance Period.(c) The LTIP Awards (i.e. the number of Performance Shares that a Participant may be allotted following the expiration of the Performance Period  provided that i.a. one or both of the Performance Conditions are partially or fully met) to be awarded to each Participant shall be calculated as follows:LTIP Award = A multiplied by B divided by C multiplied by D  where A = the Participant’s monthly gross base salary applicable as at the date of grant of the LTIP Award;B = a number of months as determined by the Board of Directors in respect of each Participant  taking into account such factors as industry benchmarking and the Participant’s position within the Orrön Energy Group (but in any case  subject to a maximum cap of 36 months);C = the volume weighted average price of the Orrön Energy share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the period between 1 December 2025 and 20 February 2026; andD = the product of the factors representing the proportional increases in the number of Performance Shares under award for each dividend (if any) until allotment  calculated by dividing the value of the Orrön Energy share at closing on the ex-dividend date plus the declared dividend by the value of the share at closing on the ex-dividend date.Fractions of allotted Performance Shares shall be rounded-off to the immediate lower whole number.Considering the volume weighted average share price of the Orrön Energy share between 1 December 2025 and 20 February 2026 of SEK 5.6  the total number of Performance Shares that may be allotted under LTIP 2026 as at the date of award of the LTIP Awards (assuming 100 per cent vesting) is 4 800 000  corresponding to approximately 1.7 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in Orrön Energy. In addition  considering additional Participants (if any) following recruitment and increased awards due to dividends (if any)  and the expected social charges linked to award  it is proposed that the total number of Performance Shares under LTIP 2026 shall not exceed 5 450 000.(d) Allotment of Performance Shares will be determined by the Board of Directors after the expiration of the Performance Period on the basis of LTIP Awards made and is conditional on (i) the Participant retaining his or her uninterrupted employment in the Orrön Energy Group until the expiry of the Performance Period and (ii) the extent to which (if any) one or both of the Performance Conditions have been met. The LTIP Award will compensate for dividends distributed (if any)  and to ensure further alignment with shareholders’ interests  LTIP 2026 will do so by increasing the number of Performance Shares under award proportionally during the award period through the formula described in (c) above  entailing also a reinvestment of dividends received during the award period. The Board of Directors may reduce (including reduce to zero) allotment of Performance Shares at its discretion  should it consider the underlying performance not to be reflected in the outcome of the Performance Conditions.(e) Minimum and maximum levels for the Performance Conditions to be fulfilled have been established by the Board of Directors. In order for the LTIP Awards to give Participants entitlement to the maximum number of Performance Shares  the maximum level for both Performance Conditions must have been fulfilled.In respect of the Total Shareholder Return Performance Condition  the fulfilment of which shall result in an entitlement of a maximum of 75 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares  the Performance Condition calculation will be made based on a comparison of Total Shareholder Return of the Orrön Energy share to the Peer Group  comparing the three month period of December 2025 to February 2026 prior to the commencement of the Performance Period  with the three month period of December 2028 to February 2029 prior to the end of the Performance Period. The LTIP Awards will vest based on the comparative Total Shareholder Return of the Orrön Energy share from no vesting below the 38th percentile performance and with vesting at or above the 38th percentile performance on a straight line basis to 100 per cent vesting of this performance condition at the 75th percentile performance or above. The Performance Condition calculation will be performed by the Board of Directors.In respect of the Strategic Performance Condition  the fulfilment of which shall result in an entitlement of a maximum of 25 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares  the measurement of the Performance Condition will be based on an assessment at the end of the Performance Period  relative to the commencement of the Performance Period  of the fulfilment of strategic performance criteria set by the Board of Directors  reflecting key performance targets such as power generation  investments  financial  sustainability and growth through brownfield and greenfield projects  M&A transactions  geographical or technological expansions and other value accretive events. The Performance Condition fulfilment assessment will be performed by the Board of Directors.The Performance Conditions described in point 1 and 2 above may each individually lead to a 75 and 25 per cent vesting of the LTIP Awards  respectively  and may also vest partially  leading to a partial vesting of the LTIP Awards. Should both Performance Conditions be fully met  100 per cent of the LTIP Awards will vest. Orrön Energy intends to present the level of fulfilment of the LTIP 2026 Performance Conditions in the 2029 Annual Report.(f) The Participants will not be entitled to transfer  pledge or dispose of the LTIP Award or any rights or obligations under LTIP 2026  or exercise any shareholders’ rights regarding the LTIP Awards during the Performance Period.(g) Shares allotted under LTIP 2026 (or any future LTI plans) shall be subject to certain disposition restrictions  meaning that the Participants shall be building towards a meaningful shareholding in Orrön Energy. The required level of shareholding will be either 50 per cent or 100 per cent (200 per cent for the CEO) of the Participant’s annual gross base salary based on the Participant’s position within the Orrön Energy Group. Notwithstanding this requirement  the Company may pay part or whole of the allotment of Performance Shares in cash in order to facilitate the payment of the Participant’s tax liabilities  or as otherwise may be determined by the Board of Directors. However  a minimum of 50 per cent of the allotted Performance Shares (after taxes and social security charges) under LTIP 2026 will be required to be retained until the required level of shareholding has been met.(h) Recalculation of the Performance Conditions and the LTIP Awards  including the number of Performance Shares allotted  shall take place in the event of an intervening dividend in kind  bonus issue  split  preferential rights issue and/or other similar corporate events.Structure and administrationThe Board of Directors of Orrön Energy will be responsible for the structure and administration of LTIP 2026  as well as for the detailed terms and conditions applicable between Orrön Energy and the Participants. The detailed terms and conditions will be adopted within the scope of the terms and conditions and guidelines stated herein. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors will be entitled to adopt different terms and conditions for LTIP 2026 regarding  among other things  the Performance Period and allotment of Performance Shares in the event of commencement or termination of employment during the Performance Period  e.g. due to new recruitments  illness  disability  death  redundancy  contractual retirement and other exceptional circumstances determined by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors will be entitled to make adjustments in order to comply with special rules or market conditions abroad. In the event that delivery of Performance Shares to Participants cannot take place under applicable law or at a reasonable cost and employing reasonable administrative measures  the Board of Directors will be entitled to decide that Participants may  instead  be offered a cash settlement. In the event of a change of control  all LTIP Awards under LTIP 2026 will vest in full.Peer GroupThe Board of Directors has reviewed the Peer Group and determined that it shall consist of the following companies for LTIP 2026: ABO Energy  Bonheur  Cloudberry  Energiekontor  Eolus  Fortum  Magnora  PNE  Scatec  Solaria  TRIG and Ørsted. The Board of Directors shall have the power to amend the Peer Group in order to maintain a representative and relevant group of companies during the Performance Period.Delivery of shares  costs etc.In order to secure the delivery of shares to the Participants and cover potential costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2026  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue up to 5 450 000 warrants of series 2026:1 (see item 21 a) of the proposed agenda)In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Board of Directors’ proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2026:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company may hedge its obligations under the LTIP 2026 by entering into (or maintaining) an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the Participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2026 (see item 21 b) of the proposed agenda).The LTIP 2026 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the Performance Period. The maximum cost for granting LTIP Awards under LTIP 2026  excluding costs related to delivery of the Performance Shares  is approximately 0.25 MEUR  assuming 100 per cent vesting.Effects on key figuresUnder the assumptions set out in item (c) above and upon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under LTIP 2026 amounts to 4 800 000 shares in Orrön Energy (subject to recruitments and adjustments for dividends)  corresponding to approximately 1.7 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the total number of Performance Shares under LTIP 2026 reaches the cap of 5 450 000 shares in Orrön Energy  it will correspond to approximately 1.9 per cent of the current total number of shares and votes in the Company.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal for LTIP 2026 has been prepared by the Compensation Committee and resolved on by the Board of Directors.Other incentive schemes in Orrön EnergyFor a description of the Company’s other LTIP’s  reference is made to the Company’s Annual and Sustainability Report for 2025  note 22  and the Company’s website  www.orron.com.Majority requirementThe proposal to implement LTIP 2026 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2026:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 21 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 21: Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2026 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2026:1 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third partyBackgroundUnder the LTIP 2026 proposed by the Board of Directors under item 20 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the Participants in the LTIP 2026.In order to secure the Company’s obligation to deliver shares and to cover a portion of the costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 5 450 000 warrants of series 2026:1 on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the LTIP 2026 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 b) below.The Board of Directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 21 a) below with the requisite majority  the Board of Directors intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 21 b) below.Item 21 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2026 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2026:1In order to secure the Company’s obligation to deliver shares under the LTIP 2026  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2026:1 in the Company on the following terms and conditions:A maximum of 5 450 000 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders’ preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to secure the Company’s obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2026.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 November 2026.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company’s share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 May 2026 up to and including 1 May 2030.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 5 450 000 warrants  the Company’s share capital will increase by SEK 66 312.15 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria överkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 5 450 000 warrants (a) free of charge to Participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company under the LTIP 2026 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2026.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2026:1 will be available at the Company and on the Company’ website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the LTIP 2026 in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 21 b): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the LTIP 2026 through an equity swap arrangement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company may hedge its obligations under the LTIP 2026 by entering into (or maintaining) an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2026.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the LTIP 2026 in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 22: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of shares and convertible debenturesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to decide  at one or more occasions until the next Annual General Meeting:(i) to issue no more than 28 500 000 new shares with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off; and(ii) to issue convertible debentures with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off  where the number of shares that may be issued after conversion shall not exceed 28 500 000.The Board of Directors may resolve to deviate from the shareholders’ preferential rights.

The evidence supporting tovorafenib  which acts on tumor growth driven by an abnormal BRAF gene  is an important development. The positive CHMP opinion moves us closer to delivering a meaningful targeted therapy for these patients and their families.”Today  there is no global uniform consensus on standard of care for most children as they progress with this rare brain tumor vi and there is a considerable need for approved therapies that can minimize long-term morbidities and maintain or improve overall quality of life.“Treatment options for relapsed/refractory pediatric low-grade glioma have remained limited for decades  which is why a targeted therapy like tovorafenib has the potential to transform how we manage this disease in particular the most common subtype carrying the BRAF-Fusion oncogene ” said Professor Olaf Witt  Director  Translational Pediatric Oncology  Hopp Children's Cancer Center Heidelberg. “As a treating physician  I am encouraged by the prospect of introducing a new treatment option for this challenging condition in Europe.”The CHMP’s positive opinion is based on data from the pivotal Phase II FIREFLY-1 study ii which evaluated tovorafenib in 137 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered pLGG who had received at least one prior systemic therapy. The study demonstrated:Clinically meaningful tumor response: An overall response rate of 71% per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for High-Grade Gliomas (RANO-HGG) criteria and 53% per Response Assessment in Paediatric Neuro-Oncology for Low-Grade Glioma (RAPNO-LGG) criteria  with a clinical benefit rate of 77% per RANO-HGG criteria and 58% per RAPNO-LGG criteria. viiAn overall response rate of 71% per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for High-Grade Gliomas (RANO-HGG) criteria and 53% per Response Assessment in Paediatric Neuro-Oncology for Low-Grade Glioma (RAPNO-LGG) criteria  with a clinical benefit rate of 77% per RANO-HGG criteria and 58% per RAPNO-LGG criteria. Rapid and durable responses: Based on RAPNO-LGG criteria  among responders  the median time to response was 5.4 months with a median duration of response of 18.0 months. viiBased on RAPNO-LGG criteria  among responders  the median time to response was 5.4 months with a median duration of response of 18.0 months. Manageable safety profile: Tovorafenib was generally well-tolerated  with predominantly Grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and a low discontinuation rate (9.5% patients discontinued treatment due to events considered by the investigator to be related to tovorafenib). vii Common TRAEs included hair color changes  elevated creatine phosphokinase  fatigue and anemia. viiTovorafenib was generally well-tolerated  with predominantly Grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and a low discontinuation rate (9.5% patients discontinued treatment due to events considered by the investigator to be related to tovorafenib). Common TRAEs included hair color changes  elevated creatine phosphokinase  fatigue and anemia. Convenient Dosing: Once-weekly oral administration  with or without food  in liquid or tablet formulation  minimizing disruption to daily family routine.iFollowing this positive opinion  the European Commission will review the CHMP’s recommendation  with a final decision on marketing authorization expected in the coming months.About tovorafenibTovorafenib (known as OJEMDATM in the U.S.) is a Type II RAF kinase inhibitor of mutant BRAF V600  wild-type BRAF  and wild-type CRAF kinases. It targets the signaling pathways regulating cell growth and division  which can slow  stop  or shrink cancerous tumors.In the U.S  tovorafenib is indicated for the treatment of people 6 months of age and older with relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade glioma harboring a BRAF fusion or rearrangement  or BRAF V600 mutation.viii It was approved by the U.S. FDA under accelerated approvalix based  in part  on response rate and duration of response according to multiple response assessment criteria: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology High-Grade Glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria  Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Low-Grade Glioma (RAPNO-LGG) criteria  and Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology Low-Grade Glioma (RANO-LGG) criteria. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.Tovorafenib is under evaluation as a therapy for patients aged less than 25 years with pLGG harboring BRAF fusion or rearrangement  or BRAF V600 mutation requiring front-line treatment (Phase III FIREFLY-2/LOGGIC).The medicine was granted Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the FDA for the treatment of patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration  and it was evaluated by the FDA under priority review. Tovorafenib has also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma and from the European Commission for the treatment of glioma. Tovorafenib has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation in South Korea.Ipsen licensed the rights to tovorafenib from Day One Biopharmaceuticals Inc in 2024.About FIREFLY-1iiFIREFLY-1 is evaluating tovorafenib as once-weekly monotherapy in people aged 6 months to 25 years with relapsed or progressive pLGG harboring a known activating BRAF alteration.The trial is being conducted in collaboration with the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium. The pivotal and ongoing Phase II FIREFLY-1 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tovorafenib in 137 relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered pLGG patients  who had received at least one line of prior therapy  across two study arms. Arm 1 (n=77) was used for the efficacy analyses and Arm 2 provided safety data for an additional 60 patients  initiated to enable access to tovorafenib once Arm 1 had fully recruited.Additional information about FIREFLY-1 may be found at ClinicalTrials.gov  using Identifier NCT04775485 and at CTIS under EUCT number 2024-510691-20-00.About pediatric low-grade gliomaPediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is a rare childhood brain tumor. More than 800 new cases of BRAF altered pLGG are identified in the European Union each year.iii  BRAF is the gene most commonly altered in pLGG  which include two primary types of BRAF alterations – a BRAF gene fusion and BRAF V600E mutation. x These BRAF alterations account for more than 50% of pLGG cases worldwide and until recently there were no approved treatments for people with pLGG driven by BRAF fusions.vipLGG can be chronic and relentless  with patients suffering profound side effects from both the tumor and the treatment  which may include chemotherapy and radiation.iv These side effects can impact their life over the long term  and may include muscle weakness  loss of vision  and difficulty speaking. This type of tumor has a high risk of progression  and many children with pLGG require long-term treatment.v While most children with pLGG survive their cancer  children who do not achieve a complete resection following surgery may face years of increasingly aggressive treatment.About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted a positive opinion to Acoziborole Winthrop (acoziborole) as a single-dose oral treatment for both early and advanced-stage gambiense sleeping sickness in adults as well as in adolescents 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kilograms.The CHMP positive opinion is a critical step. It is granted through accelerated assessment under a specific procedure intended for countries outside of the European Union and used for high-priority medicines for diseases with unmet needs. This will facilitate approval of the medicine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and pave the way for an update of WHO’s sleeping sickness treatment guidelines  a move that would eventually expand access to other countries in Central and West Africa  where the disease is endemic.Once approved in endemic countries  the medicine  co-developed by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and Sanofi  could provide a significant advance over current therapies. Existing treatments require either a 10-day course of oral medicine or a combination of injections and oral therapy for advanced cases.Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly  human African trypanosomiasis  commonly known as sleeping sickness  is almost always fatal without treatment. In the early stage of the disease  people experience headaches or fever. In the late stage  the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and invades the central nervous system  causing behavioral  cognitive and neurological symptoms  including seizures  sleep disturbances  aggression  confusion  lethargy  convulsions  and  ultimately  death.“In just 20 years  we have gone from complicated treatments including arsenic derivatives with serious side effects  to today  when a single-dose  one-day therapy could safely cure patients ” said Luis Pizarro  MD  Executive Director at DNDi. “This progress is testament to the transformative power of collaborative science and will bring us closer to finally eliminating sleeping sickness  a disease that has killed millions on the African continent in the past century.”DNDi conducted a pivotal phase 2/3 study in the DRC and Guinea in partnership with National Sleeping Sickness Control Programs  while Sanofi carried out the regulatory approval process. The CHMP positive opinion is based on clinical and non-clinical data provided by the partners  with efficacy and safety supported by the phase 2/3 study  published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal  which demonstrated success rates at 18 months of up to 96 percent across both stages of the disease with a good safety profile.“The development of acoziborole and today’s positive scientific opinion is a victory for Africa-led science  made possible thanks to African doctors and researchers who conducted cutting-edge pharmaceutical research in some of the most remote and difficult-to-reach areas on the continent ” said Erick Miaka  MD  Director of the DRC’s national sleeping sickness control program.In 1998  nearly 40 000 cases of gambiense sleeping sickness were reported  with an estimated 300 000 undiagnosed. At the time  the only available treatment for those with the late stage of the disease was an injectable arsenic derivative with serious side effects. More than two decades of investment in new therapeutic tools resulted in increasingly improved treatments  including nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy in 2009 and the first oral treatment fexinidazole in 2018. In 2024  fewer than 600 cases of the disease were reported.“For decades  Sanofi has maintained an unwavering commitment to the fight against sleeping sickness  standing alongside DNDi  the World Health Organization  and other partners in one of the most enduring and successful public-private health collaborations ” said Audrey Duval  Executive Vice President  Corporate Affairs at Sanofi. “Together  we have helped drive cases to historic lows—achieving a remarkable 98% reduction since 2001—by putting patients first and investing in innovation where it is needed most. Acoziborole builds on this legacy and represents a decisive step forward in eliminating gambiense sleeping sickness by 2030.”Sanofi will donate Acoziborole Winthrop to the WHO through its philanthropic organization  Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective. The medicine will be available free of charge to patients.Another study underway in the DRC and Guinea is investigating Acoziborole Winthrop for the treatment of children ages one to 14.About the DNDi programme for the development of acoziboroleThe DNDi programme for the development of acoziborole was supported by grants from the Federal Ministry of Research  Technology and Space (BMFTR) through KfW  Germany; the BBVA Foundation (through the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation’); Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS)  the Netherlands; European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Association (EDCTP2 programme) supported by the European Union; Global Health EDCTP3 and its members; Gates Foundation; Médecins Sans Frontières International; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  as part of Norway’s in-kind contribution to EDCTP2; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss State Secretariat for Education  Research and Innovation (SERI); Stavros Niarchos Foundation; Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID); UK International Development; and other private foundations and individuals.About DNDi’s sleeping sickness programmeAcoziborole Winthrop is the first oral single-dose new chemical entity to be issued from DNDi’s lead optimization programme for sleeping sickness. It started with an initial hit identified in the chemical library of Anacor Pharmaceuticals  which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016. The initial structure was then optimized with Scynexis and Pace University and was then selected as a candidate for development and Phase I safety studies conducted successfully in France  the UK  and Malaysia.Acoziborole Winthrop is the latest innovation brought by more than two decades of innovation efforts by DNDi  Sanofi  and partners. In 2009  they developed a combination of existing drugs known as NECT  which was extremely effective and with a good safety profile. A donation programme was set up by Sanofi and Bayer to provide NECT free of charge to endemic countries through the World Health Organization (WHO)  radically improving treatment options for patients.DNDi  Sanofi  and partners developed fexinidazole  which in 2018 became the first all-oral treatment available for gambiense sleeping sickness. This ten-day treatment is now available in all sleeping sickness-endemic countries.Acoziborole Winthrop can be administered as a single oral dose  potentially without the need of hospitalization or supervision of the treatment at home. This means it could become a major tool to facilitate efforts to finally eliminate sleeping sickness.About DNDiThe Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is a not-for-profit medical research organization that discovers  develops  and delivers safe  effective  and affordable treatments for neglected populations. DNDi is developing medicines for sleeping sickness  leishmaniasis  Chagas disease  river blindness  mycetoma  dengue  paediatric HIV  cryptococcal meningitis  and hepatitis C. Its research priorities include children’s health; gender equity and gender-responsive R&D; and diseases impacted by climate change. Since its creation in 2003  DNDi has collaborated with public and private partners worldwide to deliver new treatments for six deadly diseases  saving millions of lives.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the EU for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). This recommendation covers children aged two to 11 years with moderate-to-severe CSU  an inadequate response to histamine-1 antihistamines (H1AH)  and who are naïve to anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy for CSU. A final decision is expected in the coming months.The positive CHMP opinion in young children is supported by data from the LIBERTY-CUPID clinical study program  including two phase 3 studies  Study A and Study C  in which children aged six to 11 years participated (clinical study identifier: NCT04180488)  and the single-arm  CUPIDKids phase 3 study (clinical study identifier: NCT05526521) in children aged two to 11 years with CSU.Dupixent is approved for CSU in certain adults and adolescents in several jurisdictions including the US  the EU  and Japan.In the US  a supplemental biologics license application has been accepted for review seeking approval for Dupixent in certain children aged two to 11 years with CSU. The US Food and Drug Administration decision is expected by April 2026.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU in adults and adolescents have not been fully evaluated outside of jurisdictions where it has been approved. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU in children aged two to 11 years have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About CSUCSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1AH  medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of itch and urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled despite H1AH treatment in many patients  some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life.About DupixentDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  CSU  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  bullous pemphigoid  and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis in different age populations. More than 1.4 million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab development programDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 12 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on February 26th 2026  approved the Group's fourth quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Statements.Fourth Quarter 2025 ResultsQ4 Group EBITDA of €214 million  strong 21% EBITDA marginExcellent total cash generation of €177 millionAround €650 million distribution to shareholders targeted by August 2026 aQ1 2026 Group EBITDA expected to range between €165 million and €195 millionResilient US customer demand while imports continue to declineEarly signs of activity rebound in key Middle East marketsHIGHLIGHTSFourth Quarter 2025 ResultsGroup EBITDA of €214 million  up 2% sequentially  EBITDA margin remained strong at 21% Tubes EBITDA per tonne of €548 down (12%) sequentially reflecting negative mix effects Mine & Forest EBITDA at €38 million increasing sequentially by 10%  reflecting higher iron ore market prices partially offset by seasonally lower volumesAdjusted free cash flow of €204 million; total cash generation of €177 million – aided by robust collections and inventory managementEnded the period with a net cash position of €39 million  improving by €179 million sequentiallyOUTLOOKFirst Quarter 2026 Group EBITDA is expected to range between €165 million and €195 million:In Tubes  EBITDA per tonne is expected to be broadly in-line with the Q4 2025 level  while volumes are expected to be below the Q4 2025 level.In Mine & Forest  production sold is expected to be around 1.4 million tonnes.Full Year 2026 results are expected to be influenced by the following dynamics:North America Tubes: Sustained strength in sales volumes thanks to Vallourec’s market share gains during 2025 A slight near-term decrease in US market prices  with improving industry supply-demand conditions leading to potential improvement later in the yearInternational Tubes: Lower sales volumes in H1 2026 due to slower bookings in H2 2025 An activity recovery in key Middle Eastern markets setting the stage for higher second half volumes Broadly stable market pricing versus the second half of 2025  with discrete customer contracts driving selective price upsideSlightly lower year over year iron ore production sold (approximately 5.5 million tonnes) due to an improved production process focusing on value over volumePhilippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“Vallourec delivered robust results once again in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was above the midpoint of our guidance and we produced a solid 21% EBITDA margin. We converted over 80% of EBITDA to cash – a further demonstration of our consistent improvement in working capital management and operational efficiency. After paying over €370 million to our shareholders in 2025  we returned our balance sheet to a net cash position in December.“From this solid financial base  we will deliver on our commitment to be one of the most shareholder friendly companies in our peer group. We are targeting returns to shareholders of approximately €650 million between January and August 2026  a nearly €280 million increase versus 2025. We have adopted a balanced distribution framework  limiting warrant dilution through buybacks  growing distributions through a targeted interim dividend payment of €1.75 per share in Augustb  and maintaining a defensive balance sheet.“Reflecting on our 2025 results  I am pleased with the many milestones we have achieved. After reaching zero net debt at the end of 2024  we paid a substantial dividend to shareholders for the first time in a decade in 2025. We significantly narrowed the profitability gap with our primary peer to the lowest level since we embarked on the New Vallourec Plan in early 2022. Finally  our consistent improvement in profitability and financial resilience was recognized with Investment Grade credit ratings across all three rating agencies.“Our focus in 2026 turns to profitable growth through targeted R&D and capital investments to solve the energy challenges of today and tomorrow. In doing so  we will remain committed to our core principles of value over volume and operational excellence. We are investing in value-added capacity enhancements  including our new high-torque threading line in the US and advanced coating capabilities like our Cleanwell® solution. Meanwhile  we are progressing our ambitions in New Energies  with a recently-announced partnership with XGS Energy in the advanced geothermal arena  and a memorandum of understanding with Baker Hughes in the hydrogen space. We are seeing particularly strong momentum in geothermal markets as the industry searches for ways to deliver clean baseload power to meet rapidly growing energy demand  which is accentuated by rapid growth in artificial intelligence and energy‑intensive data centers.“In the US  our assets remain highly-utilized and recent booking activity remains strong. Industry pricing has softened slightly  but we are encouraged by the downward trend in imports due to Section 232 tariffs and the resilience of our customers’ activity. In International markets  commercial activity remained subdued in the second half of 2025. In the Middle East we are seeing signs of acceleration – especially in markets with higher levels of unconventional activity.“We see potential for activity to increase in the second semester and beyond as the oil market rebalances  gas-related activity increases and the acceleration of depletion necessitates investments to maintain and grow production.”The consolidated financial statements are included in the pdf version of the press release.Key Quarterly DataQuarterly figures in € million  unless noted Q4 2025 Q3 2025 Q4 2024 QoQ chg.
