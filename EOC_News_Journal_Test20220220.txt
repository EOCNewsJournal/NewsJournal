That was seen as an important step in improving foreign investor access by index providers  including JPMorgan Chase & Co.  who are considering adding the securities to their benchmarks.Instead  investors were told the government and Reserve Bank of India are taking a “very calibrated approach” on the issue  with Governor Shaktikanta Das underlining the risk of outflows as well as inflows on index inclusion. Alongside record borrowings -- and a global surge in yields -- the lack of action has soured sentiment toward the nation’s bonds.“As a foreign participant in India’s local bond market  Euroclearability is important in order to ensure best execution for our clients and is a vital component for inclusion to the JPMorgan bond index ” said Anders Faergemann  senior portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments in London. “The outlook for Indian government bonds has turned bearish amid elevated price pressures and a heavy supply calendar.”Overseas investors withdrew about 14 billion rupees ($190 million) from government bonds through the so-called Fully Accessible Route  or bonds with no restrictions for foreigners since Jan. 31  a day before the budget disappointment.

Yields eased later after the RBI surprised with extremely dovish policy. The yield fell four points this week to close at 6.66% after the central bank announced few auction cancellations.The potential index inclusion was expected to bring in as much as $40 billion of inflows and help mop up a record debt supply of 15 trillion rupees.Less AttractiveThe index inclusion seems to have hit a roadblock for now with the authorities refraining from abolishing the capital gains tax on Euroclear transactions.

The basic information needed is:the date of the agreement the names of the parties the description and number of securities the consideration paid  andthe SDRT payable.Practical guidance on making an SDRT notification is available on gov.uk.Sometimes (for example on an offer for sale) someone other than the accountable person undertakes to notify and pay the tax  having entered into an agreement with HMRC under regulation 4.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.44,0.56,True,English,"['Stamp duty', 'SDRT Administration', 'accountable date', 'STSM142070', 'notice', 'charge', 'Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations', 'off market” transactions', 'CREST Participants’ accounts', 'overdue tax', 'time limits', 'International Ltd', 'ten days', 'Non-CREST Transactions', '7th day', 'basic information', 'Practical guidance', 'accountable person', 'accounting date', 'accountable date', 'Euroclear UK', 'formal form', 'residual securities', 'CREST system', 'SDRT notification', 'payment', 'circumstances', 'HMRC', 'operator', 'subject', 'agreement', 'EUI', 'Transfers', 'interest', '14th', 'month', 'charge', 'notice', 'names', 'parties', 'description', 'number', 'consideration', 'gov', 'example', 'offer', 'sale', 'someone']",2022-02-17,2022-02-18,True,gov.uk

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Lesser Performing Reference Index  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Level (for each Reference Index): 100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Level and Coupon Barrier (for each Reference Index): 60% of each hypothetical Initial Level Contingent Coupon Rate: 6.50% per annum (or 1.625% per quarter) Contingent Coupon Amount: $16.25 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Level of 100.00 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and is not the actual Initial Level of any Reference Index. The actual Initial Levels for each Reference Index are set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. We make no representation or warranty as to which of the Reference Indices will be the Lesser Performing Reference Index. It is possible that the Final Level of each Reference Index will be less than its Initial Level .Hypothetical Final Levels of the Lesser Performing Reference Index are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Levels. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount 130.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 120.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 110.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 100.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 90.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 80.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 70.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 60.00 101.625%* $1 016.25* 59.99 59.99% $599.90 50.00 50.00% $500.00 40.00 40.00% $400.00 30.00 30.00% $300.00 20.00 20.00% $200.00 10.00 10.00% $100.00 0.00 0.00% $0.00* Including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index increases by 25% from the Initial Level to a Final Level of 125.00. Because the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index is greater than its Trigger Level and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index.Example 2: The level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index decreases by 10% from the Initial Level to a Final Level of 90.00 . Because the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index is greater than its Trigger Level and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index.Example 3: The level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index decreases by 50% from the Initial Level to a Final Level of 50.00. Because the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index is less than its Trigger Level and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $500 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Reference Index)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -50%) = $1 000 - $500 = $500* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on levels of the Reference Indices that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes or on an investment in the securities included in any Reference Index.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Indices. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Receive Less than the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index is less than its Trigger Level  the amount of cash that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date  beginning in February 2023  the closing level of each Reference Index is greater than or equal to its Initial Level  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Coupon Payment Date. You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after that payment. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing level of any of the Reference Indices on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing level of any of the Reference Indices is less than its Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index will be less than its Trigger Level.• The Notes Are Linked to the Lesser Performing Reference Index  Even if the Other Reference Indices Perform Better — Your return on the Notes will be linked to the lesser performing of the Reference Indices. Even if the Final Levels of the other Reference Indices have increased compared to its Initial Level  or have experienced a decrease that is less than that of the Lesser Performing Reference Index  your return will only be determined by reference to the performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Index  regardless of the performance of the other Reference Indices.• Your Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined by Reference to Each Reference Index Individually  Not to a Basket  and the Payment at Maturity Will Be Based on the Performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Index — The Payment at Maturity will be determined only by reference to the performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Index  regardless of the performance of the other Reference Indices. The Notes are not linked to a weighted basket  in which the risk may be mitigated and diversified among each of the basket components. For example  in the case of notes linked to a weighted basket  the return would depend on the weighted aggregate performance of the basket components reflected as the basket return. As a result  the depreciation of one basket component could be mitigated by the appreciation of the other basket components  as scaled by the weighting of that basket component. However  in the case of the Notes  the individual performance of each of the Reference Indices would not be combined  and the depreciation of one Reference Index would not be mitigated by any appreciation of the other Reference Indices. Instead  your return will depend solely on the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Index.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Indices. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which theAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaContingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Coupon Payment Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the fourth Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be limited to one year. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Index even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in securities included in the Reference Indices.• Your Return May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Securities Represented by the Reference Indices — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the securities represented by the Reference Indices. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on those securities during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the securities represented by the Reference Indices may have. Furthermore  the Reference Indices may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even if the levels of the Reference Indices increase after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Is Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the levels of the Reference Indices  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of Canada• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes on the Cover Page of this Pricing Supplement Is an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Were Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes is based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate is based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Indices that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the levels of the Reference Indices  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with companies included in the Reference Indices  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Indices. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the levels of the Reference Indices  and therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Indices• An Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Associated in Investing in Stocks With a Small Market Capitalization — The Russell 2000® Index consists of stocks issued by companies with relatively small market capitalizations. These companies often have greater stock price volatility  lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies. As a result  the level of the Russell 2000® Index may be more volatile than that of a market measure that does not track solely small-capitalization stocks. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also generally more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments  and the stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded  and be less attractive to many investors if they do not pay dividends. In addition  small capitalization companies are often less well-established and less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel  making them more vulnerable to loss of those individuals. Small capitalization companies tend to have lower revenues  less diverse product lines  smaller shares of their target markets  fewer financial resources and fewer competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies. These companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.• An Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Relating to Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Because foreign companies or foreign equity securities included in the SX5E are publicly traded in the applicable foreign countries and are denominated in euros  an investment in the Notes involves particular risks. For example  the non-U.S. securities markets may be more volatile than the U.S. securities markets  and market developments may affect these markets differently from the U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize the securities markets outside the U.S.  as well as cross-shareholdings in certain companies  may affect trading prices and trading volumes in those markets. Also  the public availability of information concerning the foreign issuers may vary depending on their home jurisdiction and the reporting requirements imposed by theirAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of Canadarespective regulators. In addition  the foreign issuers may be subject to accounting  auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE INDICESAll disclosures contained in this pricing supplement regarding the Reference Indices  including  without limitation  their make-up  method of calculation  and changes in their components  have been derived from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies of  and is subject to change by  the applicable index sponsor. Each of these sponsors has no obligation to continue to publish  and may discontinue publication of  the applicable Reference Index. The consequences of an index sponsor discontinuing publication of a Reference Index are discussed in the section of the product prospectus supplement entitled “General Terms of the Notes—Unavailability of the Level of a Reference Index.” Neither we nor RBCCM accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance or publication of any Reference Index or any successor index.The SPXThe SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of price movements among U.S. large capitalization stocks. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.S&P calculates the SPX by reference to the prices of the constituent stocks of the SPX without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result  the return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.Effective with the September 2015 rebalance  consolidated share class lines will no longer be included in the SPX. Each share class line will be subject to public float and liquidity criteria individually  but the company’s total market capitalization will be used to evaluate each share class line. This may result in one listed share class line of a company being included in the SPX while a second listed share class line of the same company is excluded.Computation of the SPXWhile S&P currently employs the following methodology to calculate the SPX  no assurance can be given that S&P will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect the payments on the Notes.Historically  the market value of any component stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In March 2005  S&P began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula  before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16  2005. S&P’s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However  the adjustment affects each company’s weight in the SPX.Under float adjustment  the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors  not all of a company’s outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups  other publicly traded companies or government agencies.In September 2012  all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock’s outstanding shares  other than holdings by “block owners ” were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally  these “control holders” will include officers and directors  private equity  venture capital and special equity firms  other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control  strategic partners  holders of restricted shares  ESOPs  employee and family trusts  foundations associated with the company  holders of unlisted share classes of stock  government entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However  holdings by block owners  such as depositary banks  pension funds  mutual funds and ETF providers  401(k) plans of the company  government retirement/pension funds  investment funds of insurance companies  asset managers and investment funds  independent foundations and savings and investment plans  will ordinarily be considered part of the float.Treasury stock  stock options equity participation units  warrants  preferred stock  convertible stock  and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile  such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block.For each stock  an investable weight factor (“IWF”) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example  if a company’s officers and directors hold 3% of the company’s shares  and no other control group holds 5% of the company’s shares  S&P would assign that company an IWF of 1.00  as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However  if a company’s officers and directors hold 3% of the company’s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company’s shares  S&P would assign an IWF of 0.77  reflecting the fact that 23% of the company’s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control. As of July 31  2017  companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the Reference Index. Constituents of the Reference Index prior to July 31  2017 with multiple share class lines were grandfathered in and continue to be included in the Reference Index. If a constituent company of the Reference Index reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure  that company will remain in the Reference Index at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaThe SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all 500 component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941 through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to use and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941-43 = 10. In practice  the daily calculation of the SPX is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the “index divisor.” By itself  the index divisor is an arbitrary number. However  in the context of the calculation of the SPX  it serves as a link to the original base period level of the SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX  which is index maintenance.Index MaintenanceIndex maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions  share changes  stock splits  stock dividends  and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions  such as stock splits and stock dividends  require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX  and do not require index divisor adjustments.To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to corporate actions  corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index divisor for the change in market value  the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing level.Changes in a company’s total shares outstanding of 5% or more due to public offerings are made as soon as reasonably possible. Other changes of 5% or more (for example  due to tender offers  Dutch auctions  voluntary exchange offers  company stock repurchases  private placements  acquisitions of private companies or non-index companies that do not trade on a major exchange  redemptions  exercise of options  warrants  conversion of preferred stock  notes  debt  equity participations  at-the-market stock offerings or other recapitalizations) are made weekly  and are generally announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading the following Friday (one week later). If a 5% or more share change causes a company’s IWF to change by five percentage points or more  the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case-by-case basis.License AgreementS&P® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”).

Russell began dissemination of the RTY (Bloomberg L.P. index symbol “RTY”) on January 1  1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31  1986. The RTY is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000® Index  the RTY consists of the smallest 2 000 companies included in the Russell 3000® Index. The Russell 3000® Index measures the performance of the largest 3 000 U.S. companies  representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The RTY is determined  comprised  and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.Selection of Stocks Underlying the RTYAll companies eligible for inclusion in the RTY must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell’s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated  has a stated headquarters location  and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible)  then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same  FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (“HCIs”): country of incorporation  country of headquarters  and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) (“ADDTV”) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs  FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company’s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs  then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the company’s assets are primarily located  FTSE Russell will use the primary country from which the company’s revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data  FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters  which is defined as the address of the company’s principal executive offices  unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation “BDI” country  in which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla  Antigua and Barbuda  Aruba  Bahamas  Barbados  Belize  Bermuda  Bonaire  British Virgin Islands  Cayman Islands  Channel Islands  Cook Islands  Curacao  Faroe Islands  Gibraltar  Guernsey  Isle of Man  Jersey  Liberia  Marshall Islands  Panama  Saba  Sint Eustatius  Sint Maarten  and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory  including countries such as Puerto Rico  Guam  and U.S. Virgin Islands  a U.S. HCI is assigned. “N-shares” of companies controlled by individuals or entities in mainland China are not eligible for inclusion.All securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However  in order to reduce unnecessary turnover  if an existing member’s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May  it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the “rank day” (typically the last trading day in May  but a confirmed timetable is announced each spring)  but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange  that stock will be eligible for inclusion.An important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization  which is defined as the market price as of the rank day in May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable  common stock  non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock  convertible preferred stock  redeemable shares  participating preferred stock  warrants  rights  installment receipts or trust receipts  are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist  they are combined to determine total shares outstanding. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g.  tracking stocks)  each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist  the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.Companies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly  companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for the RTY. Royalty trusts  limited liability companies  closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses  as defined by the SEC  including business development companies)  blank check companies  special purpose acquisition companies  and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded. Bulletin board  pink sheets  and over-the-counter (“OTC”) traded securities are not eligible for inclusion.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaAnnual reconstitution is a process by which the RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company’s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year  FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or  when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th  reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition  FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution.After membership is determined  a security’s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as “free float.” The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of the investable opportunity set.License AgreementFTSE Russell and Royal Bank have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement providing for the license to Royal Bank  and certain of its affiliates  in exchange for a fee  of the right to use indices owned and published by FTSE Russell in connection with some securities  including the Notes.FTSE Russell does not guarantee the accuracy and/or the completeness of the RTY or any data included in the RTY and has no liability for any errors  omissions  or interruptions in the RTY.

Publication of the SX5E in February 1998  based on an initial index level of 1 000 at December 31  1991.Composition and MaintenanceThe SX5E is composed of 50 component stocks of market sector leaders from within the 20 EURO STOXX® Supersector indices  which represent the Eurozone portion of the STOXX Europe 600® Supersector indices.The composition of the SX5E is reviewed annually  based on the closing stock data on the last trading day in August. The component stocks are announced on the first trading day in September. Changes to the component stocks are implemented on the third Friday in September and are effective the following trading day. Changes in the composition of the SX5E are made to ensure that the SX5E includes the 50 market sector leaders from within the Eurozone.The free float factors for each component stock used to calculate this Reference Asset  as described below  are reviewed  calculated  and implemented on a quarterly basis and are fixed until the next quarterly review.The SX5E is also reviewed on an ongoing monthly basis. Corporate actions (including initial public offerings  mergers and takeovers  spin-offs  delistings  and bankruptcy) that affect the SX5E composition are announced immediately  implemented two trading days later and become effective on the next trading day after implementation.Calculation of the SX5EThe SX5E is calculated with the “Laspeyres formula ” which measures the aggregate price changes in the component stocks against a fixed base quantity weight. The formula for calculating the SX5E value can be expressed as follows:Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaSX5E = Free float market capitalization of the SX5E DivisorThe “free float market capitalization of the SX5E” is equal to the sum of the products of the price  the number of shares  the free float factor and the weighting cap factor for each component stock as of the time the SX5E is being calculated.The SX5E is also subject to a divisor  which is adjusted to maintain the continuity of the SX5E values across changes due to corporate actions  such as the deletion and addition of stocks  the substitution of stocks  stock dividends  and stock splits.License AgreementWe have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with STOXX providing for the license to us and certain of our affiliated or subsidiary companies  in exchange for a fee  of the right to use indices owned and published by STOXX (including the SX5E) in connection with certain securities  including the Notes offered hereby.The license agreement between us and STOXX requires that the following language be stated in this document:STOXX has no relationship to us  other than the licensing of the SX5E and the related trademarks for use in connection with the Notes.

Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting a Reference Index or the Notes (for example  upon a Reference Index rebalancing) and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of a Reference Index or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on February 18  2021  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”).We will deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 9 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM’s underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this pricing supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesLinked to the Lesser Performing of ThreeEquity IndicesRoyal Bank of CanadaSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Indices. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that reduced the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms were set. Unlike the estimated value that is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Indices  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduced the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors resulted in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price. See “Selected Risk Considerations—The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Is Less than the Price to the Public” above.VALIDITY OF THE NOTESIn the opinion of Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP  the issue and sale of the Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Bank in conformity with the Indenture  and when the Notes have been duly executed  authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor  the Notes will be validly issued and  to the extent validity of the Notes is a matter governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario or Québec  or the laws of Canada applicable therein  will be valid obligations of the Bank  subject to equitable remedies which may only be granted at the discretion of a court of competent authority  subject to applicable bankruptcy  to rights to indemnity and contribution under the Notes or the Indenture which may be limited by applicable law  to insolvency and other laws of general application affecting creditors’ rights  to limitations under applicable limitations statutes  and to limitations as to the currency in which judgments in Canada may be rendered  as prescribed by the Currency Act (Canada).

The guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting 2022. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityInformation regarding the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  is available on the company's website (https://www.ratos.com/).A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the executive management a competitive total remuneration.Long-term share-related incentive plans have been implemented in the company. Such plans have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. For more information regarding these incentive plans  please see https://www.ratos.com/.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration to senior executives shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one year. The variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 100 per cent of the total fixed annual cash salary. Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of retaining executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 25 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the compensation committee.For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance (Sw: sjukförsäkring)  shall be premium defined. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  for example  reimbursements for dental care and health care (including medication)  medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring) and company cars. For the CEO  such benefits may be paid out to a customary limited extent.Termination of employmentUpon termination of an employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for six months for the CEO and twelve months for other senior executives. Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income  amount to not more than 60 per cent of the fixed monthly cash salary at the time of termination of employment  shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed senior executive is not entitled to severance pay and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than twelve months following termination of employment for senior executives. When termination is made by the senior executive  the notice period may not exceed six months  without any right to severance pay.Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc.The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They may be individualized quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development. The proportion of variable cash remuneration varies depending on the senior executive's position in the company. The portion of the variable cash remuneration linked to the outcome of financial criteria is normally 100 per cent for the CEO and the CFO  approximately 80-90 per cent for the Business Area Managers and approximately 75 per cent for other senior executives  even if the portion can be larger or smaller depending on the specific circumstances  and shall be dependent on (i) EBITA growth in Ratos group and  (ii) growth in earnings before tax (EBT) for the Ratos group.Generally  50 per cent of the variable cash remuneration is paid out the year after the earning year and 50 per cent is paid out the following year. However  up to 100 per cent of the variable cash remuneration can be paid out the year after the earning year  provided that the received cash remuneration exceeding 50 per cent is entirely invested in instruments in Ratos's long-term incentive program.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the measurement period has ended. The Board of Directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO  based on a proposal from the compensation committee. For variable cash remuneration to other senior executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the starting point for the evaluation shall be the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the compensation committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The development of the gap between the remuneration to the senior executives and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a compensation committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The compensation committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the compensation committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the compensation committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.The Board's proposal for decision on long-term incentive program 2022/2026 (item 16)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves upon the implementation of a long-term incentive program 2022/2026 (""LTI2022"") for the CEO and other key employees in Ratos in accordance with the below.(a) The Board's proposal for resolution on LTI2022 (the inclusion of the CEO in the LTI2022 is conditional upon the approval of the Annual General Meeting under item (b) below)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves upon the implementation of LTI2022 consisting of convertible debentures and warrants (below jointly referred to as the ""Instruments""). An incentive system for the company's business organization is of great strategic importance for Ratos. Accordingly  the Board considers that the existence of an efficient share-based incentive program for the company's key employees is essential for the company's development and the Board has the ambition to offer all key employees an opportunity to participate in the program every year. The purpose of this proposal is to create opportunities for retaining and recruiting competent employees and increase their motivation. LTI2022 will further increase the interest in the company's business and profitability and will contribute to a common interest of participants and shareholders. Consequently  the Board considers that the introduction of LTI2022 on the terms described below will be to the benefit of the group and the company's shareholders.Issue of convertible debentures and warrantsThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves: a. that the company shall take up a debenture loan at a nominal amount not exceeding SEK 152 000 000 or such lower amount set forth below  through an issue of convertible debentures without preemptive rights for the shareholders. The loan shall be represented by convertible debentures not exceeding 1 835 000  each at a nominal amount equivalent to the Conversion Price (as defined below). The increase of the company's share capital could not amount to more than SEK 5 780 250 upon full conversion of the convertible debentures (based on the current quotient value and that no recalculation has been made in accordance with Appendix 2A).b. to carry out an issue of not more than 892 500 warrants without preemptive rights for the shareholders. The increase of the company's share capital could not amount to more than SEK 2 811 375 upon full exercise of the warrants (based on the current quotient value and that no recalculation has been made in accordance with Appendix 2B).Yet  a maximum of 1 835 000 Instruments can be issued. The increase of the company's share capital can accordingly  if all the Instruments are subscribed for and converted/exercised  amount to not more than SEK 5 780 250 (based on the current quotient value and that no recalculation has been made in accordance with Appendix 2A and 2B).The right to subscribe for the Instruments  with deviation from the shareholders' preemptive rights  shall belong to the CEO with not more than 300 000 Instruments (excluding the right to additional subscription as stated below)  members of Ratos's management team with not more than 250 000 Instruments (excluding the right to additional subscription as stated below) and other key employees currently active in Ratos or that may be recruited  with a right to subscribe for not more than 70 000 Instruments per person (excluding right to additional subscription as stated below). Members of the Board whom are not employed by Ratos are not included in this offering. In total  a maximum of 15 individuals are included in this offering.As a requirement for the allotment of warrants  the employee must have signed an agreement with the company regarding repurchase right etc. in which inter alia the company or another buyer appointed by the company has a right to redeem the warrants if the participant's employment is terminated. Furthermore  allotment of the Instruments requires that subscription is legally possible and that it  according to the Board's opinion  can be made with reasonable administrative and financial efforts.Participants are (with some exceptions) free to decide to which extent the offered Instruments shall consist of convertible debentures. For warrants apply  that they may constitute a maximum of 50 per cent of the offered Instruments. Subscription of the convertible debentures must be made in even numbers of hundreds. Subscription of the warrants must be made in even numbers of integer.In the event that a participant does not subscribe for the full amount of Instruments offered  other participants have a right to subscribe for such Instruments to an amount corresponding to not more than 50 per cent of their initial allocation  where the proportion of warrants can  however  only consist of a maximum of 25 per cent of the participant's initial allotment. In the event that the issue is oversubscribed  the Instruments will be allotted pro rata in relation to the participant's initial allocation. Oversubscription of the convertible debentures must be made in even numbers of hundreds. Oversubscription of the warrants must however be made in even numbers of integer.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preemptive right are to introduce an incentive program through which the employees are offered to take part of  and contribute to  an increased value of the company's share during the period of the proposed program and to enable the company to retain and recruit competent employees.Subscription of the Instruments shall be made during the period from and including 16 May 2022 until and including 20 May 2022 on a separate subscription list. The Board has the right to extend the subscription period for the Instruments and the time for payment for the convertible debentures.The subscription price for each convertible debenture shall correspond to its nominal amount. Subscribed convertible debentures shall be paid in cash no later than on 27 May 2022 . The warrants shall be issued free of charge  resulting in costs for the company (see below). As the warrants are offered to the employees free of charge  the employees will thereby receive a benefit corresponding to the market value of the warrants at allocation  calculated in accordance with Black & Scholes. To stimulate participation in the program  Ratos intends to subsidize part of the cost  meaning that the net cost for participants amounts to approximately 25 per cent of the benefit value from the first acquired warrant. The subsidy is received in connection with the allotment. Warrants that are subscribed for in addition to the initial allocation are not covered by any subsidy and shall be issued at market price determined as stated below and shall be paid in cash no later than 27 May 2022 .Each convertible debenture entitles at the time of conversion to one new share of Class B in the company and each warrant entitles to subscription of one new share of Class B in the company. The convertible debentures can be converted into new share of Class B during the period from and including 31 May 2025 until and including 31 July 2026 . The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares of Class B during the period from and including 31 May 2025 until and including 15 December 2025 . Such right is however limited to a period of 10 Banking Days as from the first Banking Day immediately following the publishing of an interim report/year-end report as well as regarding the convertible debentures during the period from and including 1 July 2026 until and including 31 July 2026 and regarding the warrants during the period from and including 16 November 2025 until and including 15 December 2025 .The Conversion Price per share at the time of conversion of the convertible debenture shall correspond to a certain percentage (the ""Percentage"") of the volume weighted average share price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the shares of Class B during the period from 3 May 2022 until and including 12 May 2022 (the ""Conversion Price"")  but not lower than the current quotient value of the shares of Class B or higher than SEK 80 . The Percentage shall be determined in accordance with the calculation methodology set forth in Appendix 1 which is available at the company's website.Based on a price for Ratos's share of Class B amounting to SEK 59.00 and other market conditions prevailing on 5 January 2022 the Percentage would have been 102.87 per cent and the Conversion Price SEK 60.69 . If the total return (i.e. the share price development with reinvested dividends) for Ratos's share of Class B amounts to at least 10 per cent up to the time of exercise  the subscription price per share shall upon exercise of the warrants correspond to 100 per cent of the volume weighted average share price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for shares of Class B during the period from and including 3 May 2022 until and including 12 May 2022   but not lower than the current quotient value of a share of Class B. If the total return (i.e. the share price development with reinvested dividends) for Ratos's share of Class B amounts to less than 10 per cent up to the time of exercise  the subscription price per share shall upon exercise of the warrants  however  correspond to 125 per cent of the volume weighted average share price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for shares of Class B during the period from and including 3 May 2022 until and including 12 May 2022   but not lower than the current quotient value of a share of Class B. The starting point for the calculation of the total return shall correspond to the volume weighted average share price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for shares of Class B during the period from and including 3 May 2022 until and including 12 May 2022 (corresponding to 8 trading days)  but not lower than the current quotient value of a share of Class B. The end point for calculating the share price development shall correspond to the volume weighted average share price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for shares of Class B for a period of 8 trading days immediately before the exercise of the warrant. The Percentage  Conversion Price and subscription price shall be adopted by the Board immediately after the expiration of the mentioned measurement period.Any share premium when converting to a new share of Class B in the Company or when subscribing for a new share of Class B in the Company shall be allocated to the Company's free share premium fund (Sw: fria överkursfonden).The convertible debentures are due for payment on 31 August 2026   to the extent that conversion has not taken place by then. The convertible debentures shall carry an annual interest to be determined the first time on 24 May 2022 for the period from 27 May 2022 until and including 30 September 2022 . The interest rate is STIBOR (3 or 6 months) plus 1.9 percentage points  where the starting point of STIBOR never can fall below 0 per cent. The interest is due for payment in arrears on 30 March each year  the first time on 30 March 2023   and at the maturity date of the loan.The subscription price and the Conversion Price for the convertible debentures is a market price determined as stated above. The methodology for the calculation of the subscription price and the Conversion Price for the convertibles is based on a valuation requested by the Board from one of the larger audit firms (""Valuation Firm""). For the valuation  the Valuation Firm shall apply methods considered by market professionals as established for comparable securities. The subscription price and Conversion Price for the convertible debentures is to be determined before the start of the subscription period. The calculation of the value of the warrants at allocation shall be based on a market price based on a valuation requested by the Board from the Valuation Firm. For the valuation  the Valuation Firm shall apply methods considered by market professionals as established for comparable securities. The value of the warrants at allocation is to be determined before the start of the subscription period.The new shares  which may be issued through conversion or upon subscription for new shares are not subject to any restrictions.Complete terms and conditions of the Instruments are set forth in Appendix 2A and 2B  which are available at the Company's website. The terms and conditions of the Instruments include customary terms for the recalculation of the subscription price and the Conversion Price in the presence of certain corporate events (such as dividends  bonus issues and preemptive right issues).Warrants held by the company or a wholly-owned subsidiary due to a repurchase from a participant may be cancelled by the company following a resolution by the Board with consent of the Board of Directors of the subsidiary. Cancellation shall be filed for registration to the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The Board or a person appointed by the Board is authorized to make such minor adjustments required in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB .More information on LTI2022DilutionDuring LTI2022  not more than 1 835 000 Instruments can be issued and allotted. At full subscription/conversion  not more than 1 835 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.57 per cent of the number and approximately 0.17 per cent of the votes  calculated based on the number of outstanding shares (i.e.  the total amount of issued shares reduced by the numbers of shares held by the company) (notwithstanding a possible recalculation in accordance with Appendix 2A and 2B). At full conversion and exercise of the proposed Instruments  together with already outstanding options and convertible debentures  the amount of shares amounts to 1.89 per cent of the number and 0.56 per cent of the votes  calculated based on the amount of outstanding shares.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal of LTI2022 has been prepared by the Compensation Committee in consultation with external experts and the Board. The Board has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the annual general meeting. The CEO has not participated in the preparations of the proposal.Other share-based incentive programsThe ongoing share-based incentive programs of Ratos are described in the company's annual report 2021  note 7.Effects on key ratio and costs etc.LTI2022 will entail certain limited costs consisting of remuneration to external consultants and administration costs regarding the Instruments and the program in general.Based on a share price of Ratos's share of Class B of SEK 59.00 and other market conditions prevailing on 5 January 2022   the value per warrant has been estimated to SEK 12.69   which implies a value for all warrants that could be issued of a maximum of approximately SEK 11.3 million .LTI2022  calculated on the basis of the above estimated warrant value  entails a cost for the company amounting to a maximum of approximately SEK 22.3 million   of which SEK 11.3 million refers to the benefit value of the warrants at allotment  SEK 5.7 million refers to the cash subsidy to the participants and SEK 5.3 million refers to social security contributions. The proposed convertible debentures are not expected to result in any social security contributions for the company. The dilution effect of the Instruments may affect the key ratio per share in accordance with the IAS 33 accounting standard  but to a very limited extent.The Company's costs related to the warrants can however never exceed SEK 23 million . If the value  based on the valuation at allotment  of all warrants that the participants want to subscribe  would result in a cost as above for the Company exceeding SEK 23 million   a certain number of warrants in the initial allotment are excluded of the right to subsidy  so that the Company's costs related to the warrants never exceed SEK 23 million . The allocation of the subsidized warrants in made pro rata between the participants in relation to the number of warrants that the participant wants to subscribe for in the initial allotment. The warrants in the initial allotment that are not covered by any subsidy shall be issued at market price determined as stated above and shall be paid in cash no later than 27 May 2022 .FinancingA Swedish commercial bank will offer financing for the employees who intend to participate in the convertible debenture program. Such financing will be on market terms.Instruction to the BoardThe Board proposes the Annual General Meeting to authorize the Board of the company to execute the resolution in accordance with above.Majority requirementA decision under this item (a) and item (b) below is only valid if it is supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths of both votes cast and shares represented at the Meeting.(b) Approval of inclusion of the CEO in the LTI2022As the CEO of the company  Jonas Wiström  also is a member of the Board of the company  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  as a separate resolution  to approve the inclusion of the CEO of the company in the program.The Board's proposal that the Board be authorised to decide on purchase and transfer of treasury shares (item 17) Authorization to decide on acquisition of treasury sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board during the period before the next Annual General Meeting to decide on acquisition of treasury shares in accordance with the following conditions: - Acquisition may be made of Class A shares and Class B shares. - Acquisition must take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price band registered at any time on Nasdaq Stockholm. - Acquisition may take place on one or more occasions prior to the next Annual General Meeting. - A maximum number of shares may be acquired so that the Company's holding at any time does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all the shares in the Company. - Acquisition may be made within the frame of a repurchase program in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council and with the Commissions delegated regulation (EU) 2016/1052.Authorization to decide on transfer of treasury sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board during the period before the next Annual General Meeting to decide on transfer of treasury shares in accordance with the following conditions: - Transfer may take place of all treasury shares held by the Company. - Transfer may take place on one or more occasions prior to the next Annual General Meeting. - Transfer may place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price band registered at any time on Nasdaq Stockholm. - Transfer of shares may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the pre-emptive rights of shareholders and with or without provisions on non-cash or set-off. - Payment for transferred shares shall be made in cash  or through non-cash or set-off of claims against the Company  or otherwise be subject to terms and condition. The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights when transferring shares and the basis for the sale price is that the best possible conditions for the Company can be achieved. The purpose of acquisition and transfer of treasury shares is to give the Board more flexibility in its work to create value for the Company's shareholders and to enable the transfer of own shares as payment or to finance acquisitions. It is noted that the purpose of the authorization does not allow the Company to trade in own shares for short-term profit.A decision under this item is only valid if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both votes cast and shares represented at the Meeting.The Board's proposal that the Board be authorised to decide on new issue of Class B shares in conjunction with company acquisitions (item 18)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to authorise the Board in conjunction with agreements on company acquisitions  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the pre-emptive rights of shareholders  for a cash payment  through set-off or non-cash  to make a decision on new issue of Class B shares in the Company. This authorization shall comprise a maximum of 35 million Class B shares. The new issue amount received may  for each individual agreement on company acquisition  amount to a maximum of Ratos's capital contribution for the acquisition.The reason for deviation from pre-emptive rights is that the Company shall be able to issue shares as payment in conjunction with company acquisitions  alternatively procure capital for such acquisitions. The issue price will be determined in accordance with current market conditions.The Board  the CEO or the person appointed by one of them shall be entitled to make any minor adjustments to the above decision which might be required in conjunction with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.A decision under this item is only valid if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both votes cast and shares represented at the Meeting.OTHER INFORMATIONShares and votesOn the date this notice was issued there are a total of 324 738 820 shares in the Company  of which 84 637 060 are Class A shares with one vote each and 240 101 760 are Class B shares with one-tenth of a vote each  corresponding to a total of 108 647 236.0 votes.

That was seen as an important step in improving foreign investor access by index providers  including JPMorgan Chase & Co.  who are considering adding the securities to their benchmarks.Instead  investors were told the government and Reserve Bank of India are taking a “very calibrated approach” on the issue  with Governor Shaktikanta Das underlining the risk of outflows as well as inflows on index inclusion. Alongside record borrowings -- and a global surge in yields -- the lack of action has soured sentiment toward the nation’s bonds.“As a foreign participant in India’s local bond market  Euroclearability is important in order to ensure best execution for our clients and is a vital component for inclusion to the JPMorgan bond index ” said Anders Faergemann  senior portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments in London. “The outlook for Indian government bonds has turned bearish amid elevated price pressures and a heavy supply calendar.”Overseas investors withdrew about 14 billion rupees ($190 million) from government bonds through the so-called Fully Accessible Route  or bonds with no restrictions for foreigners since Jan. 31  a day before the budget disappointment. They had poured in about 10 billion rupees in the previous week.Story continuesIndia’s 10-year bond yield rose to 6.95% earlier this month  the highest in nearly three years  after the government shocked the markets with its record borrowings. Yields eased later after the RBI surprised with extremely dovish policy. The yield fell four points this week to close at 6.66% after the central bank announced few auction cancellations.The potential index inclusion was expected to bring in as much as $40 billion of inflows and help mop up a record debt supply of 15 trillion rupees.Less AttractiveThe index inclusion seems to have hit a roadblock for now with the authorities refraining from abolishing the capital gains tax on Euroclear transactions. That is one of the key requirements of index providers such as JPMorgan.That’s a step the nation isn’t willing to take  Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said at a briefing earlier this month. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Thursday said India will tackle issues related to global bond index inclusion. Authorities have been slow on bond-market reforms amid concern of volatility in local markets.“The impetus to add now to Indian bonds is lower ” said Nivedita Sunil  fund manager at Lombard Odier. “If you are thinking about the overall macro situation from a relative value perspective it becomes less attractive.”Uncertain TimingThe impasse has generated considerable uncertainty around when Indian bonds might be added to global indexes.
